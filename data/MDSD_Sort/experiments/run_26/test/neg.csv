 I love David Sedaris. I like Strangers with Candy. But this is the worst book I've ever read. All of the characters are exactly the same, and the entire book is a repetition of one joke. Save yourself valuable time and money and stay far, far away from Wigfield 
 The concept of "Rumspringa," in which some of the world's most conservative people run wilder than most of us ever do, is fascinating.  Then why is _Devil's Playground_ so boring?  The beginning is amazing, when we get our first glimpse at the debauchery of an Amish youth party.    The rest of the film, unfortunately, is pure tedium, as the filmmakers focus on a few kids who stray rather far into drugs and other vices, but who just aren't very interesting.    One in particular, a crystal meth dealer and user, gets endless attention, and we just see him ramble about nothing much for minute after minute.  The fact that he was formerly Amish does not make his pathetic life much more interesting than that of the next white trash loser.  Another Amish drop-out is a girl who appears to have serious emotional problems and who decides to go to college.  That is all I learned about her in the movie, and it could have been conveyed in about 30 to 60 seconds.  Instead, the director goes back to the girl again and again to pad out the film's running time, even though she has nothing additional to tell us.  Meanwhile, we are not given much context for any of this.  Do most Amish kids stray this far before coming back?  Do some not stray at all?  Do the adults really just sit idly by for all of it?  After seeing this movie, I have no idea--I just know about a few kids who fell pretty far from the tree, and who aren't very interesting in themselves.  It seems many of the Amish shown here do not reflect typical Amish/Mennonite ethnic traits, which goes unexplained.  It is also clear that some of the Amish people we see, including the adults who allowed themselves to be interviewed on camera, are from substantially different Amish sects.  So does this stuff go on among all the Amish, or just in some weird group of Amish, or what?  The film never explains.    Other things irritate, such as use of the same soundtrack music over and over.  Why the filmmaker thought the electronic music of Aphex Twin was the best choice to represent the "unplugged" world of the Amish, I don't know.    The footage in this film could have been used to make an interesting 15-minute news magazine segment.  It does not work as a (barely) feature length documentary 
 Despite the opinions of other reviewers on this site, this is not a well written book.  I am speaking of the Future Interests section in particular.  In order explain concepts, the book uses terms that are defined later in the chapter, and simply gives examples without clarifying.  I think the authors are capable of explaining these concepts in an understandable way, but fail to do so.  This is evident once you use the Gilberts outline written by Dukeminier, where concepts are well defined.  Perhaps this is a ploy to sell more Gilberts.  Regardless, the textbook leaves much to be desired 
 Oh my God! Somebody said they were the creators of thrash metal? That is the biggest piece of crap ever! Hello, thrash was back in like 1981, with Slayer and Tallica. Back when Fred Durst was waxing his mother's wang.  Limp Bizkit is quite possibly the worst band since WHAM. Even the Dixie Chicks could wipe the floor with 'em. All of their songs are they same poser bullcrap. They are a gimmick. How can you take a band seriously when they have a song like Hot Dog? And My Generation? That song is such crap. It is sad that a bunch of loser kids who like to think they are cool listen to Limp Bizkit. LIMP BIZKIT IS FOR LOSERS, POSERS, MORONS, IDIOTS, and Fred Durst's family members!!  Don't buy anything LIMP BIZKIT!!! 
 I have an Infiniti G35 coupe and have been using a standard cassette adapter just fine.  Based on this, I felt that the SmartDeck would be a great upgrade.  However, it would not work at all! No sound, no skipping tracks, nothing.  It just switches fron side A to side B and then ejects. The price was great but you may have to return it. Be Prepared 
 omigod, did this garbage really pass for "hot" 2 decades back? director albert magnoli has zero sense of pacing, editing, acting, story telling, etc. and prince is as bad an actor as ive ever seen. no, i take that back -- ive seen apollonia (who herein makes her role in "falcon crest" look like lilian gish)! i will not comment on the musical score; if you like it, more power to you and go buy the album. but a movie where clarence williams, III gives the strongest performance? well, thats not a movie i ever want to sit thru again 
 I failed to realize that this was a book "edited" by as opposed to written "by" David Sedaris until his introduction. Incidentally, the introduction was the only portion of the book that I actually enjoyed. His analogy about his favorite song in middle school is not accurate in that his classmates did not have to  pay to learn his affinity towards what may have been a bad song. I do not find it endearing that he does not care what others think of his tastes.  I do not think they were bad stories. Actually, I would like to take that back, if entertainment is a measure of quality to me they were bad. It was, however, impressive how one of the writers was able to use most of the GRE vocabulary words in one short story.   I will not stop buying the books that David Sedaris authors, I will just be more careful. David Sedaris is a brilliant writer/storyteller. He may not capture all or even any of the elements of a "good" short story; I would not know an element of a good short story if I ran into one coming off the elevator. I do know that David Sedaris' stories are excellent in that they are entertaining and make no pretense of intellectualism. I can not wait for the next book he actually writes 
 Was not impressed.  Narrow scoped, personal reflections, applications limited.  I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not impressed 
 Let me first start by saying I am a huge, longtime fan of David Torn, going back to his Everyman Band work. He has a singular style and sound - which is quite a feat these days. Also let me say that I am a fan of improvisation, freestyling, blowing - whatever you want to call it.   But I have been saddened and disappointed by Torn's work over the past several years and the new release Prezens furthers the disappointment. From what I have read, Torn took the output from some recording sessions and did a mash-up - the result of which is Prezens. Why he felt compelled to do that I'm not sure, since this band is full of crack players who, in a slightly more standard, structured context, sound like they could really knock your socks off. (I saw the group play in New York in April and couldn't help thinking how great it would be to hear them play some Monk tunes, for example.) Why not just assemble the band, work out some loose song structures, and jam?  The songs are, for the most part, uninteresting and rather cliched sonic explorations. If Torn's goal was to somehow recreate and represent our increasingly fractured way of life, in this age of cell phone calls, e-mails and BlackBerry thumb, I could kind of see what he's getting at here, as the music flits from quiet to loud, from throb to tinny screech, from calm to chaotic. But even operating under that idea, the music isn't compelling or captivating or even pleasurable to listen to (and again, I LOVE full-out noise as much as the next person).  Being such a gifted artist, I'm sure Torn has grown weary of structure and wants to explore a range of sounds and styles and modes of expression. But selfishly, as a fan of his playing, I just wish the old David Torn could resurface for an album or two and give us a handful of the exquisitely brief and thrilling solos or chill-inducing chord changes that blessed his earlier efforts.  Were Prezens the output of players of lesser talent, I would merely shrug my shoulders and move on in search of the next worthwhile album. But when it comes from such an obviously talented and capable group, it makes the sense of failure that much more apparent 
 My child LOVES Geotrax and plays with them everyday.  However, Big City Lights makes your track look good but doesn't have much for a child to interact; the crane has a crank to turn but the bricks are hard to get to stick in the clamp and besides a button for sounds that is about all this has to offer.  Unlike other pieces with Geomotion this one is a bore.  My child rarely plays with this piece except to watch the RC trains go under it. 
 Hinky open/shut mechanism. It takes persistence to get the latch to click correctly and open. If it weren't so heavy, I would've returned it long ago 
 This glove will simply temporarily mask some of the symtoms associated with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and repetitive strain injuries and make problems worse. Since one still has full function of his/her hands when using this, you are further injuring your hands by using the flexor muscles in grabing and squeezing. When using these gloves, your hands and wrist will feel better at first, but once the glove is removed your problems will persist and get progressively worse 
 While I like Dr. Laura & think a lot like her I'm afraid she missed the mark with this CD/Book. I've enjoyed most of her other books but didn't find this one particularly helpful or interesting.  The CD version of the book basically spends hours telling you to get over your bad childhood & move on. It's rarely that easy. The only part of the book I found intersting was Dr. Laura's synopsis of her bad childhood. I think she should write an autobiography 
 This book was published in 1996, however, the information seems like it comes from 1986.  It is full of stereotypes and hacker rumors that any REAL hacker would laugh at.  It might be good if you want the info on search warrants, but computer hardware and software has changed so much that most of this book is irrelevant today 
 Do some research about Wilson. Find his website and listen to his sermons about family. Hear what he says about returning to the Old Testament tribal system. Find what he has said about slavery in the Old South. Think about what his 'learning' has done for him. This guy is nuttier than Lyndon LaRouche, yet he impresses the rubes with a little Latin and a bit of formal logic. "Classical Christian" education as described by Wilson and the Bluedorns is neither 
 More time could have been spent in Ney York City for this movie. Like with Friday The 13th Part Seven: The New Blood, all of the good gore scenes were cut out. But still, this is a terrible movie and I am willing to bet that not even gore will help it be better than part five 
 I'm a big fan of dummies books, have used them for years, and recommend them to students. But this one is horrid. I'm an experienced programmer with some OOP experience, and I could not follow what he was talking about. The examples where parts were completely unexplained did not help. I don't buy books so I can reread sections three times and still not be sure what the author meant. I am looking elsewhere to learn Java, and I recommed you do the same 
 I though this shark would be bigger.  I bought the same one at a gift shop in RI for 99 cents 2 years ago 
 This is by far the most pretentious piece of French crap I have seen in years. What bothers me are not the admittedly disturbing scenes, but rather the banality of the film's underlying idea, which the director, Gaspar Noe, attempted to convey in a thoroughly unremarkable fashion. The characters are not shown in any depth; in fact, there is no meaningful dialogue or any other attempt at all to introduce them to the viewer. Camera work is simply awful - somebody should have explained to the cameraman that rotating a hand-held camera at will for minutes at a time does not always produce art. Apparently, these sterile methods combined with shocking scenes of rape and murder are supposed to produce a new form of cinéma vérité.  In short, even though in France almost every baker is an "artiste" (think "baguette artisanale"), Mr. Noe is not a "cinéaste" even by French standards: hit someone in the face with a teakettle and call it art 
 I ordered two sets of BraBABY Bra Washing Holders.  When they arrived, there was no statement/invoice/receipt inside the box.  I used them today to wash three bras.  It was tricky to get the straps in the ball.  When the washing machine was on, I can hear the balls bouncing around in it.  When the wash was finished, and the bra straps were sticking out of the balls.  My bras have some satin on the edge.  The satin were all scratched up, probably from all that bouncing around.  I am very disappointed 
 I was very excited to read Dana Spiotta's 'EAT THE DOCUMENT' not only because the premise sounded great but also because of all the praise it had generated.  Unfortunately this novel did not live up to my expectations at all.  The first three fourths of the book was, in my opinion, nothing more than words on a page.  It did not set the stage for the heart of the story nor was it very interesting.  So many times I considered putting the book down never to pick it up again, however, an unfinished book nags at me therefore I was compelled to complete it.  Only the last hundred or so pages, where the focus was more on the main characters Mary Whittaker and Bobby Desoto, made the book at all redeemable.  I would have loved a lot less of the pretentious social commentary and more of an in depth look into SAFE the 70's radical group that Mary and Bobby belonged to as well as a better look into Mary's life not only for the first few years after she went underground but in present day as well.  Although this was not the fast paced thriller about two fugitives separated not only by time but irreparable actions that I thought it was, I am glad that I finished the book because if I hadn't I would have missed the best part of the story.  However, this book takes a lot of patience.  If you are not into the history of the 70's radical movement and how it relates to today, this may not be the book for you. 
 I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud 
 I should have read all of the reviews because this book was not approprite for any ages.  It was disgusting, crude and downright nasty.  My daughter started to read the book and threw it in the trash before my grandchildren could read it.  Please, Please, DO NOT buy this book.  The author should be ashamed of himself for putting this on the marker for kids and shame on amazon for allowing it.  
 if you like this book, more power to you. i wish you well. but, please: shame on the modern library editorial board for choosing this thing as the 8th greatest novel of the 20th century! ridiculous. there is nothing special about the writing, and the whole book is such a heavy-handed ideological sermon, that it is more like a dark dreary pondorous cartoon i wish i had taken no part of. if you like ugly literature, this will be for you.                 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 I must say before I write this review, I tried. I tried really hard to get into this album.  I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, a fan of all Classic Rock for that matter. I got this CD for it's historical significance. It is, after all, the first Rock Opera.  Anything you hear about this album being similar to The Wall by Pink Floyd is false. True, it is a rock opera that tells the story of a troubled individual, but it doesn't get as advanced or deep as Pink Floyd does. There are a few key problems that get in the way of this goal.  The music. Original as it may be, The Who's strange melodies and instrumentation don't do anything for me. The melodies are for the most part, predictable. When they try to go out on a limb, it fails and sounds forced. The guitar parts and solos sound thin, and although a big part of it is probably because the master tapes were ceremoniously burned and the recording isn't prime quality, I'm sure a lot of it has to do with a mediocre recording job. It has it's moments, for example, the first few secconds of "Smash the Mirror". But on the whole, it sounds almost like amateurs.  The songs. Not trying to rag on any diehard townshend fans, but the songs seem to be forced into the Opera mold. While this may make it more of a true "rock opera" than "The Wall", for example, it doesn't make for a very easy listen.  The horrible thing is that it IS possible to write songs in opera form and have them flow. Exhibit A: Queen's "A Night at the Opera". Although Queen's superb tracking skills probably helped their case a lot. Which leads me into my next point.  Lack of depth. While musicians who don't layer their songs with extra tracks and studio musicians generally appeal to me, they shouldn't try to make arena rock operas. The Who's attempts to make this work is very similar to asking the white stripes to make a rock opera. It can't be done effectively within the limits of the band.   I did give this album two stars. One for an original concept that gave us so much in the long run, and another star for those few moments it has. Smash the Mirror (the introduction), Pinball Wizard and The Acid Queen are alright. There is a reason why those tracks are popular.  I'm afraid that a lot of people aren't really analyzing this album and are just giving it five star ratings because it is "The Who", the band with the man who smashed his guitar onstage.   If you are looking for a Rock Opera, I suggest "A Night at the Opera" or "The Wall". If you are looking for another "The Who" album, I would suggest some of their later works. "The Who Sells Out" was alright, certiantly better than this. 
 The Cestus Deceptions was by far the worst Star Wars novel that I have read.  I am not often disapointed by expanded universe novels and own nearly all of them, however; this novel was a supreme disapointment.  Poorly written and horrendously paced, the author showed no grasp of any of his characters (especially Obi Wan's), with many of the characters displaying the same attributes as the others.  The clones were feminized, various non-sensical metaphors were reused repeatedly and the plot was implausible at best.  Do yourself a favor and skip this book as well as any other by this no talent hack.   
   I read about half the book before calling it quits for good.  I love the real Issaac Asimov stories, but this is not even a respectable imitator (if there are any at all).   First, we are expected to buy the idea of time travel into the past--a logical impossibility that has occasionally been gotten away with when there was great action or character development to compensate.  Halfway through, I realized that this book would have neither of these.  Instead, two of the main characters, an outdoorsman and paleantologist inexplicably bicker with each other about nothing at all, from the moment they meet.     Wu's hidden agenda seems to be to advocate environmentalism, a religion the daily tabloids and ivory tower politician/pseudo-scientists are doing enough to disseminate on their own. This is not even good for children, as it is poorly written, is philosophically flawed, and is uselessly descriptive (e.g., the main female character is described as 'pretty'...so what?).  Fortunately, I've yet to read over half of the REAL Asimov stories, so I have something to look forward to. 
 Unfortunately there are not much words to loose. Poor writing together with the fact that practically all facts were lifted from Cameron's 'Conversation with Wilder' which is highly recommended btw, make this book forgettable. Why going through the whole exercise of publishing it is quite a mystery 
 Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews 
 not being hip, I must venture out and say:    Oh my God!!!  What????  Who cares?  Franny is pregnant.  The big twist in this story was that it was in the 50s.  But beyond that, what's the point?  Take out the pregnancy and we are left with hyperintelligent, overanalytical, pretentious young adults whose parents did them a disservice by never offering them a real childhood.  Boring in the 50s and boring now.  As a fan of Catcher if the Rye, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Franny and Zooey.  Holden was familiar.  Franny and Zooey made me want to shower.  I really wish I had the time back that I spent reading this trite piece of...         
 When this title first popped up on Amazon, I was thrilled to bits. I had pretty much bought up 90% of all Amazon's *Traditional Decorating* titles, besides mistakenly buying trifles like DOMESTICITIES, which is just about as traditional as Quentin Tarantino's bathroom.   But to get back to the subject, I found most of the interiors (except the Chinoiserie-influenced one) suffer from a certain lifelessness. (Doesn't anyone in Greenwich read books that aren't bound in gilded leather or displayed artfully on a inlaid wood surface next to a giant magnifying glass with ivory handles?) The old abandoned mansions of Cuba show more life, peeling mouldy walls nothwithstanding. (What a long word! And probably misspelled too!)   So there goes another book in my shelf of Desperate decorating disappointments, right next to this thing I bought about the Spanish style homes of Santa Barbara, which have really nice tiles 
 I'm a huge Dylan fan---own everything he ever released.  In my humble opinion, this is Bob's worst.  Just a really bad CD.  'Nuff said 
 What is that? I dont wanna learn about the black people life style. I expected to listento hip-hop or rap. this dvd is the worst ever. and to amazon stuff: this dvd has no relation with music or hip-ho 
 I'm a 32DD, and while this bra does virtually eliminate bounce, I could get the same results with duct tape. Unflattering shape, uniboob (with the accompanying "interesting sweat" problems) and overpriced. 
 R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is " ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex." !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as "... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman."  --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: "Bigotry for me but not for thee." BYTW, his earlier book, "Lost Continent" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness.  It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff.    
 I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$ 
 I started this novel primarily because of massive amounts of praise heaped onto it by various family members, claiming it to be a 'DaVinci Code'(with which I have an entirely different set of issues) worthy thriller. More importantly, I am a student of mediaeval history and am willing to give most anything historical fiction/thriller-related a go. I was greatly disappointed with 'The Templar Legacy' not only because of its ridiculously slow pace and rubbish character development (if that phrase can even be applied to the novel at all) but primarily because of the astonishingly apparent lack of in-depth research by its author, Steve Berry. Whilst reading the novel, I honestly felt as if he had merely read abstracts on the topics he covered in the novel and felt that to be sufficient enough to put into final draft. Everything from theology to mediaeval history to religious life seemed to have a veil of inaccuracy hanging upon it, as if the author felt addressing his opinion to be more important than being correct. I was repeatedly shocked at the incorrect, awkward grammar, numerous misspellings of common words, and often overly camp expressions ("The land, as far as the eye could see, oozed the romance of history when marauding knights swooped like eagles from the fortified heights to prey on their foe,"- please.) Where was the editor??  Berry's knowledge of the French phrases and place names in the book is underwhelming, repeatedly changing the accent and capitalisation of the word 'abbï¿½' and misspelling the Palais des Papes. There are numerous errors seemingly every few pages that agitated me more and more as I went on: Berry refers to a character as 'half-Muslim' (Islam is an ethnicity as well as a religion?), misuses the word 'anachronistic', refers to the ancient Egyptian deities Isis and Osiris as Greek, and repeatedly makes errors regarding Catholic dogma and practices. There are numerous more glaring errors that I fail to recall. It may seem petty on my part, but I felt insulted continuously at the transparent lack of research and commitment on Berry's behalf, almost to the point of being unable to finish the book. It was as if he was attempting to seem very educated about the subject matter, spewing facts out left, right and centre, but the overall effect given off was one of shallow arrogance 
 I disliked this book.Too many people reading the book might not go to a doctor to heal.I think that some foods can help you,but I strongly believe in doctors 
 Time Enough For Love is one Heinlein's most famous books and is representative of his writing style, pacing and world view.  He touches upon many sociological subjects and tackles a number of interesting subjects and taboo mostly related to sex, incest the meaning of love.  That being said, after having his "big three" (Stranger In A Strange Land, The Moon is A Harsh Mistress and TEFL) I personally don't enjoy his work, I can understand why I'm in the minority.  TEFL follows the eternal Lazarus Long through his numerous adventures as he recounts his life while looking for reason to continue living.  The novel is divided up into four main sections uneven in length in quality.  There are times when Heinlein is right on target, examining social constructs, where they came from and how we deal with them.  Then there are times when there isn't much going on.  I think my two biggest problems with the novel were its structure and main character.  The makeup of the novel didn't lead to enough events happening nor did it produce any type of conflict normally needed to produce tension.  The novel is extensively dialogue driven and Shakespeare this is not.  Asimov got it right by mixing dialogue driven characters with at least some action but there is really very little going on in TEFL.  The one story that has some semblance of dramatic events (The Adopted Child) is clearly everyone's favorite.  As the main character Lazarus Long is lacking.  I kept drawing parallels between him and another famous fictional character: Lestat de Lioncourt from Rice's Vampire novels.  Both obviously share the immortal parallel but Lestat's personality and flaws made him much more interesting as a character.  Perhaps Long is a characterization of Heinlein himself and as we all know fiction is better then reality.  This book was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula in 1974.  A particularly amazing year with Clark's Rendezvous With Rama and Niven's Protector also in the mix.  Rendezvous is in a whole different playing field then the rest and won both awards hands down and deservedly so.  Bottom Line:  Maybe a must read for Heinlein aficionados and readers of classic sci-fi but this just doesn't work as social sci-fi for me.  Also the book is just too long 
 In my opinion, as a non-author, this book is poorly written.  The book gives examples on financial calculations that can be done to determine if a piece of property is a good investment.  However, the examples given are either too complex to be meaningful outside of the specific situtation or too simple to gain any understanding.    The second section of the book on "case studies", is not made for new investors.  The examples involve huge sums of money and very complex situations.  Two examples come to mind:  One case study discussed buying an apartment complex in an overpriced area, another rambled on about legal trouble he had with a local zoning board.  A simpler more straight forward example of properties would be much more valuable.  I also did not appreciate the fact that his company is plugged throughout the book.  I guess it offers some value in that he has actually experienced the situations in the book but I cannot help but think this book was written only for the benefit of his company and not to eduate the readers.  I have read many real estate books written by many successful investor who never mention their company's name.  He mentions his constantly.    This book may make sense for investors with large cash reserves($500,000+) in that it explains some creative ways to identify ways to improve a property and it is written from real experience, but in general I do not recommend it

 Ms. Mayes puts her nose in the air about tourists - and what does she think she is except a tourist with a little more time for her travels than most of the rest of us?  Got news for you, Ms. Mayes - just because you can spend a month in a country when most of the rest of us have a week or 10 days doesn't make you any less a tourist.  And your sneers at your fellow/sister Americans aren't going to win you any more readers in the long run.  On second thought, this level of snotty self-satisfaction and loathing for America and Americans is what I guess I expect from academics these days. 
 I am a hard core Laymon fan and have even gone to Amazon U K to obtain some of his more obscure titles that have been ignored here in the US..Until now I had never met a Laymon that I did not like although some are vastly superior to others however, that being said, I did not bother to finish this one,read more than 2/3 but put it aside not  caring how it came out,it is just  not up to his level. The horror novel world lost a major source when he passed away. Since a new one has been issued annually after his passing I think it might be that he has become a franchaise like Ludlum, V C Andrews and the Deadly Sin/Commandment author( Lawrence somebody)...long dead but still grinding out sub par tomes for the eager public,,,??????  A damn shame. 
 I was disappointed with the movie. I foremost ordered it because I wanted a movie in German, not because of the actors in it. It was German alright, but that was about all I liked. So this schoolteacher goes to Turkey to follow the girl of his dreams and all sorts of bizare things happen to him on the way. This spontaneous girl Juli accompanies him on the way and wants him to fall in love with her instead, which of course, he eventually does. Storyline is okay, but the whole movie is just a mess. The director tried too hard to make it hip, modern and fun, that somehow it simply is not. Christine Paul just doesn't fit the part she's playing, maybe it's her age, maybe because she never seems to get comfortable with her part, and Moritz Bleibtreu really isn't that cute and one never gets the chance to really like any of the characters. It ends up being a mess one watches from the distance. I was glad when the movie was over an I am not planning on watching it again, so if anyone wants my copy, let me know.  
 Another young adult book by an author good at fairy tales, but this one is a collection of four fairy tales instead of a stand alone story. The book blurb says that two of the fairy tales are retellings and two are "new", but I found all of them to feel like retellings of stories I'd already heard. I didn't care for the book, but the kidlet loved it. He just likes McKinley, I think 
 This is a disgrace... don't waste your mone 
 I bought two of these and had to return both of them because they both were defective!  After a few days, they started making a terrible loud clicking sound when one of the parts moved up and down.  This product is a piece of junk 
 This diaper pail is certainly the worst I have used.  It works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week I was ready to get a new diaper pail.  It does not keep oders in much at all, and I don't even put poopy diapers in it.  After about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it doesn't do any good.  Yes, a plus is the using regular bags, but so does the Diaper Champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this.  I'm definitely going back to the Diaper Champ; I only bought this one because it was the only one at my store, now I know it was worth the wait for the Diaper Champ in the mail 
 Whyte's historical knowledge and presentation of 4th and 5th century life creates a credible and interesting background for this story. As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one 
 Hurrah for "sustainability" and "biodiversity"! Down with the human race 
 Waited 22 days only to find the tape was the wrong format.30 days after i returned it was told not in stock.waited another 30 day for a credit 
 This is a good example of the typical self-delusion of creationism passing as serious thought.  All the book really proves in its pages is that if a person wishes something to be so badly enough, it will become so, but only in his or her own mind.  The stratigraphic "evidence" is selectively presented in a distortive, inaccurate fashion, so as to suit conclusions previously reached.  The serious reader on the subject is far better advised to read Kurten's "Not From the Apes", and not some drivel like this book 
 Here's the deal scoop on this.  Lots of repeated questions, at least one blatantly wrong answer, and some ambiguous questions that will make you feel stupid for not getting it when in fact it's just a stupid question.  A lot of times the author gets lazy and will provide the following explanation as to why the answer is correct: "statement of fact".  Gee that doesn't help too much.  I guess you can get this book if you like tough love, meaning, it MAY teach you by abusing you.    Not a book for you if you don't already know the material.  Only get it if you need sample questions.  
 The book is not bad if you can get over the liberal agenda. What would be expected from Mike Wallace? I hate to admit this, I would like to have seen historical pictures of the CMH and its recipients. 
 To the point; The plot is boring, the herione is boring, the storyline and characters are not believable. Total waste of money. And a disgrace to a wonderful piece of american liturature. I am willing to read a parody, spin off, or background story based off of Mitchell's GWTW. However, Ms. Randal did a poor job and wasted good paper on this flop. She could have made this story MUCH better.  
 I wish I could give this book a 0 rating. I have yet to understand why this world figures that a woman (or man) must be immoral in order to make a name for herself, or discover her soul. The only thing I enjoyed about this book is how it brought me back to a darn near picture perfect example of the immoral woman written about in the Book of Proverbs as compared to the woman of wisdom. The main character was so selfish in this book. I did feel sorry for the character because of her lost state but, ultimately I found my self very detached from this woman. This book is more about being blind and decieved rather than "awakened." I can now conculed I am not a fan of Mrs. Chopin or her incoherent character Edna! I understand the concept of equality for women, but come on, is this piece of literature really desired as a voice for feminism! In all my encounters with that which is labeled as dealing with the feminist cause/ feminist literature/feminist ideals, I have yet to be persuaded that is someting worthy of association with. 
 I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality.   In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.  'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family. Take it w/a grain of salt 
 I brought this tea thinking it was a great deal. Then while steeping my tea I noticed something in the bag. At first I thought it was a rock, but it looked like a garden snail. I cut the bag open and it was a garden snail! YUCK! I checked several bags and approx 50% of them had snails in them.  This is the worst tea experience I've had 
 Unfortunately, this is poorly designed. It is too high to rest you wrist on comfortably and the 'stimulating' rolling rubber parts are too hard and abrasive 
 This has the hit "Talk Talk", and than a bunch of boring tracks which follow it. I am a massive garage rock fan, being in love with both the Sonics and the Monks. However, these guys just don't have the rawness that is required to make a truly great garage rock band. The covers are pretty below average, which is surprising. A good garage band like the Sonics manages to improve on the originals. Good thing I didn't buy this, I just borrowed it from a freind of mine. Really not what the sounds of the garage are like, these guys are just too repetitive. It sort of makes me wonder why they are considored to be one of the genre's best bands. Not really worth owning unless you are a diehard 
 Jennifer Lopez is a has been and Jane Fond is has been had too many times.  The "stars" just refuse to retire and enjoy their money.  Jane, get married again and drift off into oblivion.  Jen, take some of your millions and open a finishing school for underprivileged hispanic girls, something like Saint Operah is doing for her people.  The world would be a better place if the privileged would spread their wealth around.  Anyway, the movie is your standard schlock that the movie industry is grinding out these days since they ran out a talent about 10 years ago.  enjoy 
 Yes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I'm concerned.  I love these kinds of stories and I went to see this film with a lot of excitement... first because it has a interesting subject. Second because it has a great actor. I thought Denzel Washington would never associate himself with a bad script... but I was wrong.  But Denzel is always top notch. The rest isn't.  By now you already know the story. A good detective... a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch... the hunt... blah blah blah....  The script is idiot from page one. The killer (as we will see as the story develops) travels by simple touch. So... excuse me... why doesn't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed??? I mean... The guy is sooo powerful (and mobile) that I find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place.  But... ok... let's give the screenwriters a break.  Somewhere in the middle of the film, the demon enters a cat. Ok... so he can enter all kinds of animals. Fine.  Later on, the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon, he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around. His brilliant idea: the forest. Full of animals.  Was I the only one who did not know the ending before it came????  Want more?  In an interesting twist, the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on... his own brother. And no one will believe the truth! How is he gonna get out of such a mess???  In the world of storytelling, there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation: EITHER the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself - so he should know! (and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything...) OR something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil (despite the fact that there was a way out).  First line of solution: Die Hard, The Fugitive. Second line of solution: S7ven, Chinatown.  We have none of that here.  Instead we have an evil god against a simple man (great starter for drama, right?) ...BUT the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker... and the demon gets stronger and stronger... to the point where we get the fact that the demon IS invincible long before he actually wins. And the great turnaround never comes.  Obviously we all hope he will be defeated... and that's why I kept myself seated all through the film... because if there was a way out... it would be brilliant. If the character dropped the towel... it would be thought provoking to say the least.  But no... the ending was easy and predictable. The screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions. He wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under "The story ends bad" label. Without any depth.  Every villain has a weak point. It is up to the hero to explore it (may he loose or win). The only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data. We have the data the moment the demon enters a cat. That's why we know how's gonna end.  What about the girl who helps Denzel? What about his nephew? Shouldn't they be part of the ending too? Don't come with the "this is an open-ending" kind of talk!  Do I sense a smell of desire for a sequel? Quick! Gas masks!!!! Or... as A.C.Doyle would write: "Quick, Dr. Watson, the needle!"  Despite a stupid screenplay. Denzel is always great.

 The author like so many others lumped all Christian denominations and seeminingly monotheistic religions together as one. No, not all Christians are the same. Furthermore, the author took many verses in the Bible out of context, rather than choosing to see it as a whole, he instead sees it in pieces, as being contradictory, not bothering to take seriously WHY the Bible made certain statements 
 This was an important book for its time period, but it has little relevance for the 21st century reader.  Graves is guilty of having the right message mingled with the wrong presentation and poor scholarship.  Much of his material is highly speculative, inaccurate, and entirely without references to source material.  There is a great case to be made for acculturation between ancient Near Eastern religious traditions and Christianity; however this book is not it.  There is a large body of propaganda material on this topic, so I would suggest that readers stick to manuscripts of more traditional scholars such as Dr. Price, Dr. Hoffmann, Dr. Pagels, Dr. Wells, Dr. Leeming, and Earl Doherty.  At least they credit the reader's intelligence with more solid scholarship 
 I've decided not to write this review in a sarcastic tone.  Amanda Marshall was a breath of fresh air back in 1995 when her debut album came out.  I saw her in concert and she was great.  Then came Tuesday's Child, an okay follow-up.  Then, unfortunately, she released Everybody's Got a Story.  I'd rather eat sandpaper than listen to the muck on this album.  I think the biggest mistake Amanda made was co-writing all of her songs.  She didn't write the songs off her debut, save for three songs.  Since Tuesday's Child she's been writing horrible lyrics.  UGHHHHH 
 5 Stars on Cream reunion DVD/CD, and Eric does a great job here, but..........  I just hate daytime concerts, something about the lights at a show and having everything dark and just focusing on the band is what its all about.   I just have always refused to see day shows.   Yes I have tried, just to much going on around you to see it takes away big time from the show.  plus I hate having a few brews in the day, then I will burnout and crash, Sun and Beer dont mix.     pure and simple.     I dont care if SRV came back from the dead, if so he better play at night   ZZ Top are old   Robert Randolf is like a record stuck on broken, the whole show  only ONE song of Doyle Bramhall II?!  duh    
 Cute toy, its actually still in the box as its a christmas gift, but I will say it will last maybe 10 minutes before it sustains major damage.  Flimsy, and I mean FLIMSY plastic. I can take the door and move it in almost a complete circle as the plastic is so cheap.  Same with the helmet.  I'd return it right off, but I know my son will love it, but if I had seen it before I bought it, it never would have come home with me 
 Pity poor Cap Weinberger.  Once a Renaissance Man, steeped in art, literature and music, he now spends his twilight years rewriting his legacy.  "In The Arena" is a carefully crafted and minutely calculated piece of revisionist history written by a thoroughly corrupt politician beyond redemption.  Even if you don't know the facts, Weinberger's  prose gives him away, filled as it is with qualifiers, deliberate misstatements and classic Weinberger Distancing Maneuvers.  An expert dissembler, Cap has scattered misleading scenarios and outright falsehoods all through the manuscript; it becomes tiresome.  Are his memoirs worth reading?  If you like being an armchair detective, absolutely.  This book challenges discerning and informed readers to unravel a fascinating web of deceit and half-truths.  It also contains interesting anecdotes from a simpler time and a glimpse into an honorable world that no longer exists.  It's too bad Weinberger hasn't appropriated the values of that world into his own life 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 Would have given "0" stars on this one.  Boring and lacks any direction 
 Come and hear Sunset Boulevard songs slaughtered - 2 mega big songs crying out for the Big Voice and Big Orchestra and she goes and undersings them with plinky plonky piano as the only background. Streisand's versions wipe  the floor with her. She's not even close. This style fits very  uncomfortably with the rest of the album which on the whole is  unlistenable. Only Come On Come On has any true grace or prescence. AVOID 
 I usually love JAK books but this book was the dullest book I have ever read. It took me a month to read it when I usually read her books it a 3-5 hour session. I think the reason I did not like it was there was in my opinion too much detail about the dream levels and the heroines family/friends were not likeable. I also think the book missed her trademark sense of humor 
 We did this book in a bookclub.  The language in the book was a bit rough I thought and it was just plain weird.  Would not recommend this book for anyone to read. 
 Periodically throughout Eric Clapton's solo career, his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll.  His self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start, and his most recent offering, "Reptile," makes adult contemporary sound exciting.  A similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, with "Backless," "Another Ticket," and "Money & Cigarrettes" all competing for title of Clapton's Most Forgetable Album.  The country is mellow, the blues are mellow, and even the rockers are mellow.  This is easy listening for classic rock fans 
 I love this show. It is very entertaining, informative and "gotta be there". I have 1-5 seasons now and enjoy going back and watching them again and again 
 Tastefully written, this book indulges the reader in creative fantasy, but I find it lacks the essential element of truth that I find tantalizing. A truly erotic tale will work its magic if the storyline is plausible. This  book's tales are so far-fetched and almost ameturish that I couldn't get  wrapped up in, let alone turned on by, any of them. For individuals just  beginning their journey of sexual freedom and uninhibited expression, this  may be a good choice. Bottom line, in my opinion, this book is for  beginners only 
 Like you (I'm sure) I saw this machine on television (mistake number one) and then ordered it online without ever trying it first. This machine is a joke. If you cannot get your legs over your head then MAYBE this machine is for you. But this is NOT for serious users who stretch everyday. I can do more with my $5 stretch band from Target than I can with this big heavy space-taking piece of junk. The resistance is zero, and just laughable over all. Save yourself the money, and frustration - buy a lightweight no-hassle stretch band! 
 I am extreamly disappointed with this product. The icons do not give an indication of the type of weather you can expect. Instead, they provide an indication if the weather is getting worse or better. The fluff on the out side of the box states: "Forecast Icon Based on Changing Barometric Pressure." The way I read that is the Icons will provide a forecast, but they do not.  I do not understand why you would have a rain Icon, a cloudy icon, a partly cloudy icon and a sunny icon if they are not a forecast. I was so surprised at reading this in the manual, I called La Crosses tech support. Tech support confirmed what I read was accurate. As stated, in on of the other reviews, the station is difficult to read when it is stand mounted. You will have to bendover or be in a seated position in order to see things clearly. Adjusting the contrast does not help. Wall mounting might be a better option. The buttons, as stated in another review, feel mushy when pushed. The outdoor sensor is not compleatly weather proof so you will need to mount it where it will not get wet from rain or snow. A potentially great product that is poorly executed.  
 Glad I caught this garbage on VH1 before I shelled out any $$. Watching this jittery unprofessional video gave me nausea. Was it too much to ask that the ONLY good live video footage we may EVER have of this great band be of good quality? Guess not. I could never sit through this again - thanks for nothin 'boys 
 I, too, have read The Artist's Way and found much that was valuable in it. It's a beautiful book, inspiring and helpful on many levels. So I was interested to read Julia Cameron's memoir. What struck me immediately was her writing style, which I don't particularly like. Her dialogue, especially, is stilted and awkward. Do none of the people in her world use contractions? Anyway, as the book got deeper into her life and she began to describe her breakdowns or "breakthroughs", as her Taos friends insisted on seeing these obvious psychotic episodes, I at first arm-chair diagnosed her as being bi-polar. One of her doctors, did too. But then he changed his mind and told her that she never had been and to wipe that from her consciousness. It came to me though, that this woman may well be the world's highest functioning schitzophrenic! She hears voices and she takes instructions from them. They "dictate" books, essays, plays, and even music to her. And then I realized that the entire concept of The Artist's Way is for each of us to hear our own voices which will then dictate great works of art to us. Of course, there's more to it than that, but this realization made me more than a little uneasy. There are so many contradictions in this book. At an early age she became completely disenchanted with the Catholic Church and abandoned it, but later on in life, she entrusted her health and her sanity to new-age healers who gave her readings (sometimes across great distances) and prescribed strange remedies. Although these remedies never seemed to work, she continued to consult with them and follow their advice. Unless, of course, their advice clashed with what she really wanted to do, which generally was to move from one coast to another, seeking some sort of peace and contentment, which I fear she will never find. I did not find this book helpful in any sort of artistic sense. I don't think any truly sane person would want to persue art in such an obsessive and unhealthful manner. I, for one, wouldn't have the energy. I will say that it was a book that I found hard to put down, but attribute that to it being sort of a car-crash type of book, more than to its literary style. 
 I wouldn't exactly say I'm sorry that I read this book, but I was definitely expecting more out of it. I did make it to the end, where I thought the vignettes would come together to create a meaning and one of those lightbulb over your head moments where you realize what's been happening all along. However, the end was just as confusing as the rest of the book. I felt like I had just spent my time reading something that amounted to nothing. What a disappointment 
 This is a long boring tome on Malaysian history filled with a plethora of incomprehensible names of people and places.  The minute details, instead of enlightening, cause one to find it hard not to fall asleep - much less make any sense out of what the authors are trying to relate.  The 344 pages of text could have been easily reduced by 50%, thus making the book much easier to read & understand.  The authors swamp the reader with so many useless insignificant details that it is almost impossible to glean any useful information from this tediously long book.  Given the fact that this gobbledygook is a 2nd edition, the first having been written 20 years ago, it is hard to believe that there could have been much demand for a revised look at Malaysia's history.  I had hoped to use this book in one of my university history courses on Southeast Asia.  There is no way I would inflict such esoteric pedagogic claptrap on my students 
 The other reviewers were right! Thank God I only borrowed the book from the public library. Had I bought it I would have demanded a refund.  Is this really Evanovich writing? Or is it mostly Hughes? I find it hard to believe that she can write this bad after reading the Plum series.  Max is ultra rich, established right away in the first chapter who thinks he knows everything there is to know. As for his car Muffin... I'm not so sure what to say about a menopausal car.  Jamie sounds dumb, like a flat character trying to find dimension.  The story, plot, etc. leaves much to be desired. Good thing they put a limit as to how low your rating can get or this would be a negative 
 Remember Amway has a cult following too - even today, they are the largest online seller of health & beauty.  Ponder that then, as you read these other reviews on this book.  Then go find something else to read.   This book is way too old, and the author wasn't precient enough to make it of any use today.  For instance the author predicts in 10 years from his writing this book - ie that by 1941 - all Airplanes will have no rudder!  He thinks it's useless. His disdain for the rudder is evident thoughout the book and he couldn't be  more plain about it.  If you plan to fly Cessna 172 all your days - and you do not have any interest whatsoever in the science of flight - and you don't mind being mislead by someone who is now well over 100 years old and took a stab at the 'bible of aviation' only 15 years after man took flight - then maybe there are a few enough 'flying truisms' scattered about this book to make it worth your money.  Having flown fixed wing incld aerobatics, and helicopters for over 10 years - and being a perpetual student of modern aerodynamics - I found myself wanting to vomit more than a few times reading this 
 I have read other works by Duong Thu Huong, and those works inspired me to pick up this novel.  Knowing that her work is banned in her home country was also incentive to check out more of her stuff.  This novel is chock full of social commentary and the brutality of man against man, but I can't help but think that this was a less than adequate translation of her work.  Othertranslations I had read of other pieces presented her style as direct and unabashed, revealing the worst and best of her characters in an unfiltered, honest way.  There is much of that philosophy in this book, but the sentences themselves became rather convoluted and sometimes just downright poor in grammar.  I would prefer NOT sounding like an English teacher when discussing literature, but when the writing can't seem to sort itself out to let the matter within speak, then reading becomes more of a chore than a pleasure.  I strongly recommend many of Duong Thu Huong's work, but I would suggest avoiding this one.  Perhaps one day a more competent translation will come out. 
 I was very disapointed by this book. I have been working with pyrography & gourds for many many years now, & always look for a technique I might like better than what I am using. I wish I had seen the reviews first before buying, I am VERY sorry I bought this & will hold my other thoughts to myself. I DO recommend an excellent book for wood burning, PYROGRAPHY WORKBOOK: A Complete Guide to the Art of Woodburning, by SUE WALTERS. For growing gourds: GOURDS IN YOUR GARDEN, by Ginger Summit. For many beautiful techniques to enhance your gourd art: THE DECORATED GOURD: Beautiful Projects & New Techniques, by Dyan Mai Peterson. 
 Being a successful manager , and being an avid reader, I was expecting this book to go a bit further than it did.  I have read a number of project management books, and a number of management books, and I would have to say that this book is at best a rudimentary management book.  If you are completely new to management then maybe this book would be useful.  If you are an existing manager and are looking for practical advice on how to manage, track, and report on multiple projects, this book is not for you 
 Nothing more need be written. See, Peake! You can 'say' a lot with a little .. 
 Until a listen of this cd I never truly understood anguish, pain, and authenticity.  Morrisette is an artist of the highest caliber.  Reaching inside the depths of her soul to produce music that allows mere mortals a glimpse into the heart of genius.  Thank you Alanis for having the courage to put the struggles of growing up in suburban Ottawa as a provincial Tiffany child star into this masterpiece.  The realism of those mean streets that you survived only serve to make your art more credible.  Even the name Jagged Little Pill (and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie too) is charged with an energy that is free from all posturing and posing.  The best that music has to offer. NOT!!!!!!! 
 Cup of Clay is just that, dull. The characters are flat and uninteresting. The plot is so predictable, I knew how the book would end after the first fifty pages. I not sure if I'm more amazed that the book was published or that I finished it. I would have been much more entertained, if I had quit half way through and just written the rest of it myself. If you find this book, my advice is: Don't waste your tim 
 Maybe I got a defective one, but there was a slight humming sound even before it dialed (and no I am not talking about the dial tone). The sound was more noticeable with some phones than others, as some accentuated the frequency interference that this device added to the line. Again, the problem was the device and not Skype.  I bought an Actiontec Internet Phone Wizard instead and the noise was gone completely. So maybe I did get a defective unit, but either way there is probably some quality control issues with this device, or maybe all of them have the noise and some people don't notice. It's up to you to decide. With the Actiontec or DLINK, it will probably be much much clearer.  Also, the people posting saying you cannot dial out if you do not have a land line are COMPLETELY WRONG. You download the latest software, right click the system tray icon and choose advanced, then change the default mode to USB instead of POTS. Then you can dial by doing: "001 areacode number #"  This will dial skype from any phone... If the device didn't have that interference to it, then I would have kept it as the software and functionality is very good, even without a land line.  
 After reading Chris Gore's disappointing and disheveled The 50 Greatest Movies Never Made (see CdC #10), I had nothing but high hopes that David Hughes would be able to overcome the hurdles which tripped up Gore's earlier work, especially by limiting his scope to one genre rather than all of cinema. Alas, while Hughes's work is head and shoulders above Gore's, it remains lacking.  Fans of Cashiers du Cinemart's articles such as "The Metamorphoses of ALIEN III" (CdC #12), or "They Tried and Failed" (CdC #13), might be tempted to pick up a copy of Hughes's book as he covers similar ground in two of his nineteen chapters. Too often, however, I found myself consternated by Hughes's muddled writing. Additionally, the more I read, the more I doubted the validity of Hughes's research.  Several devilish details stuck in my craw and wouldn't let me appreciate Hughes's work. In the first chapter Hughes states that the protagonist of Richard Stark's novels is Walker, not Parker, mixing up the Stark novels with the Boorman film, POINT BLANK. An innocent mistake, yes, but an easily avoidable one. Meanwhile, I'm no expert at science fiction but even I know that the title for the unproduced WATCH THE SKIES is a nod to Howard Howard Hawks's THE THING rather than Don Siegel's INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.  Oddly, several of the films that Hughes covers have been made, albeit not in their original form. Perhaps the originals may have ranked among the "greatest" sci-fi films never made, I remain unconvinced. Too often Hughes merely reports on the back story to the production of films such as ALIEN III, ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, SUPERNOVA, et cetera rather than demonstrating how great their initial incarnations might have been.   Here's hoping that the next project someone does about unmade movies will either focus on truly great works or that they'll rethink their title 
 I absolutely loved this movie and was looking forward to reading the book, but it was a big disappointment. All the beauty and mystery built up in the cinematography of the film and the restrained behavior of the characters is lost in this book. Selene ogles Michael. There are way too many descriptions of how cool her car is. And there isn't enough added beyond the basic movie plot to make the book worth reading -- what little extra character development is done in the book is mostly trite and cliched. (Spoiler alert!!) Michael even has the obligatory "I became a doctor because the woman I loved died in car wreck and I couldn't save her!" subplot, which is so cliched it's not to be believed. Save your time and money for repeated viewings of the DVD, and cross your fingers that if a second novelization comes out it's written by someone else 
 There is nothing like waking up at 2AM few nights in a row to the voice saying " O is for Olive". Keep in mind that it takes you a few moments before you can correctly determine that it is a puzzle talking, and not an intruder or "voices" that you are now hearing. (I completely panicked the first two times). And it will keep repeating the phrase 20+ times (I counted), so you will HAVE to get out of bed, in the middle of the night to look for a screwdriver, so that you can take out the batteries, because there is no off switch 
 The sound on this DVD is absolutely horrible.  The dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects, making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering.  I also have the VHS, on which the sound is perfect, so I can still watch this wonderful movie.  But I would sure like to get my money back for the DVD 
 I think this is the worst Nokia phone I have ever had.  It just doesn't seem like it's Nokia quality to me.  I would get the Samsung slider if I could do it all over again.  Battery life is subpar, slider seems cheap and breakable, speakerphone is not loud enough.  The interface is pretty smooth, but that's about it.  If you have to have a simple interface, then this might work, but otherwise I'd get the Samsung 
 Last month,Feb.10, I ordered one box this wipes. But when I opened it today, all bag showed the exp.12/31/2006. I am wondering how to contact them 
 Exactly what my title says - how can a story with so many great monsters be so darn boring? Not to mention a Jack the Ripper plot?  It sounded great to me! I was wrong. Somehow Kelly Armstrong makes monsters in this book and their lives a total SNOOZE FEST.   First of all - her werewolves don't eat humans! What's the point of being a freakin' werewolf? Second - Her vampires only feed on humans once a year?  LAME!!!! Third - It felt like the entire book was just one big plan - harldy any action.  Characters spent way to much time having breakfast and making plans. Werewolves - HAVING BREAKFAST AT HOTELS! Fourth - She provides little to NO background story for the characters. Just when Armstrong starts to explain an interesting back story - she sends the characters to have breakfast at a diner or hotel. It's an obvious ploy to make readers purchase sequels. Ridiculous. Boring. I will not be reading one of her novels again.  It's a shame that such a great combo of monsters - that's why I bought it - turned out to be one of the least interesting books I have ever read.  Canadians like Armstrong shouldn't write horror novels - they're just too darn nice - and it shows in these peaceful and pointless monsters in "Broken" 
 I recieved this book from a friend after losing my daughter to still birth at nearly 7 months. The comparison of my family's loss to a "flight that departed just a bit early" enraged me rather than provide any comfort.  The very fact that the author could make such a shoddy comparison is a clear indicator that a tragedy of this magnitude has never touched his life.   The book continues with what I am sure were meant to be good intentions( which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one) but slowly unravels to a very thinly disguised guilt inducing essay on " aren't you sorry now you had an abortion".  This book deals very little with the heartbreak of a death of a baby that you had no power to save, it does nothing to assuage the hearts of the parents of miscarriage, stillbirth, or babies lost shortly after birth.   I do not reccomend this book if any of those events are what you are going thru now.   
 Like another reviewer, the sand bound up the moving parts and it has largely been frustrating for my twin 2 year olds. The boom release is too hard for my children to release.  The bucket does not pivot at the wrist-so it really does not scopp up sand -- it just kind of paws at it.  I suggest spending few more dollars and getting a better functioning toy for your child 
 If you just want this for a printer, its a dandy little machine.  If you want to use this for business, be prepared to fax your pages twice...  because you will have to get a call from the receiving end saying "your pages are all garbled, could you please fax again?!".  Then you either must run the "scan hotfix" off of the hp website or turn the machine off.  This happens about 1 out of every 4 faxes or scans.  You'll know when you scan something and see the horrible results.  Stay away from this machine if you need it for faxing or scanning.  Printing... sure.    Unless, of course, HP does some sort of new software patch or driver update or something, otherwise this would be one of the quickest, best multi-function machines on the market 
 Though advertised as a continuation (i.e. 14th Edition)of the "Filmgoers companion" it is only a list of people in the movies. Gone are Halliwell's definitions of movie tradecraft and lists of themes, individual classics and personal notes. A fine actor like Lee J. Cobb gets a single line, while Jayne Mansfield, known more for her off screen antics, gets many more. The quotes from the movie personalities is a nice touch, but when I look up somebodies filmography I do not want to see etc. at the end of an incomplete list 
 I have always eagerly awaited each Clive Cussler novel and this was no exception.  The story is classic Clive Cussler and by itself is fascinating, however, the writing is boring.  To me, Clive Cussler did not write the book, his son did.  The women "gush" and the men "snarl".  It was so predictible!  I even knew who the person was who was in the boat before they were even rescued.  I suprised myself when right in the middle of the rocket launch, I didn't even care if I finished the book.  Here's hoping the writing will improve in the next book 
 There is some good information to glean from this book, however, especially in the latter chapters, there is much that is contrary to my Christian world view.  The author may be more in tune to the spiritual realm than the medical/scientific community, as a whole, but his solutions go against the One who wrote the instruction manual and has the Ultimate Solution.  I found a couple of the latter chapters interesting and informative of another's beliefs, and the author brings awareness that there is more to human beings than just the physical/scientific realm, but we differ in how it is to be addressed.    
 Samantha seems a lot like Becky.  A young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions.  Instead of staying at the firm and working out her "mistake," she runs away.  This is just like Becky hiding her bills.  And then she gets a totally implausible job, because she can't tell the truth - again like Becky.  Samantha doesn't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to.  I agree that the firm would never have taken her back; they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care.  Samatha, like Becky at times, seems somewhat manic, in that she's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation.  just like Becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared.  Lithium, anyone?  I don't have an opinion on the housewife/lawyer "controversy," but I do think Kinsella's protagonists need to grow up 
 Not sure what I was expecting but it was a let down as far as the movie goes, would not suggest to other to spend the bucks on this one 
 Spiritual memoirs tend to follow the same plot line.  It's the boy meets girl story with God substituted for the girl.  There's nothing wrong with the formula, the author's job is to make it fresh and interesting.  Dan Wakefield doesn't get the job done.  The structure of "Returning" is linear, the pace is ponderous, and the insights only moderately interesting.  In fact, the entire book is an exercise in moderation, written by a moderate talent, who, on the evidence presented, has lived a moderate life.  It's no wonder Bill Moyer's, a paragon of moderation, liked this book.  There are parts of this book where the author could have revealed more.   The account of his nervous breakdown is scary, but all too brief, and on too many occasions - bouts of adolescent [activity], unsuccessful psychoanalysis, addiction to alcohol - Mr. Wakefield seems like a kid in a confessional.  He rushes through his sins in order to be unburdened, but also undiscovered.  It doesn't work.  If we give the penitent the benefit of our attention, he should give us the benefit of a compelling story 
 Ordered this at my wife's request.  She's tried cleaning silver earrings--run multiple cycles--added detergent as suggested.  It just doesn't clean.  An old toothbrush and toothpaste works much better.  A very disappointing piece of junk 
  this  book for the price could have been done in a smaller format  at a much less expensive  price.  i like  woods work alot but these really  are just a bunch  very minimal drawings streched out to make a hearty meal, no can do. it misses the mark big time. spend your bucks and buy process recess by james jean .  that came today and woww!!! 
 I received the wrong item.  It was supposed to be a Christmas present for my little girl and I had to hurry and find this item at another store.  The company still has not sent me a call ticket for UPS to come and pick it up so I can receive a refund after many emails.  I will not be purchasing from this company ever again 
 The plot seemed forced, contrived and just plain ridiculous.  The beginning of the book focuses a lot on the twin boys, relying on the "cute factor" but then they just disappear for the rest of the book.  Thin and unsuspenseful story line.  Romantic relationship not up to par with other Linda Howard books.  I feel cheated - was really looking forward to another satisfying LH book.  Oh well, maybe next time 
 This book is full of arrogant comments by New York City people who say that if you don't dress the way they say, you'll look foolish.  Nothing too interesting in here 
 I have since seen other similar complaints on several websites and have written to polyconcept.  I have to date gotten no satisfaction from either crayola or polyconcept.  The lines are blurry, there is no focus to begin with.  But the real problem is that the projector detaches constantly from the base, whenever you move it, touch it, etc.  The dry erase markers don't erase from the board; and the light stopped working after the second time my son played with it.  I can't fathom buying a new light bulb at $4.95 + s&h after a total hour of use in two sessions.  I think it's probably wiring; who knows; but it's a disappointing flimsy cheap piece of garbage. 
 ...that Robinson's latest books have become as pedestrian as this one.  I found the plot uninspiring at best, and completely devoid of surprises.  All in all, one could skip this entry and not miss a thing.  As always, Robinson is a good writer, and he's brought Banks to an interesting -- albeit depressing -- psychological place, but one can't help but feel that he and the series are simply treading water at this point.  If only the entire book were as brilliant and incisive as the very last line.  I'll keep my fingers crossed for the next one 
 I bought this cushion because I had to move from California to New York and expected the drive to be torture on my back. I researched these types of cushions and decided to get this one because it has a lot of motors compared to cheaper units, and because I had recently bought a Mogu pillow and really liked the soft feel of it--this cushion has "Sqush," which has a similar feel.The cushion has a middle portion of Sqush which is concentrated into 3 "lumps"--at your shoulders, lower back, and under the front part of your thighs, near your knees. The lumps are soft and squishy and are covered in a spandex-like material. The rest of the cushion feels like fleece.When I first plugged it in, I was immediately disappointed in the weakness of the wimpy motors. Even at the highest intensity (I never even bother with the lower two), it felt like nothing more that a moderate vibration--definitely not enough to un-knot an aching back. The pre-set programs are fine but I rarely use them. It comes with straps but I had a hard time trying to install it in my car because the instructions were non-existent and it wasn't intuitive at all. I ended up just attaching them to some hardware on the underside of the chair, which worked well.I can't decide if the cushion made the drive any more bearable. The lower back cushioning filled my lumbar region fine but the shoulder padding must be too thick because it pushed my shoulders forward and forced me into a slight hunched position which strained my back and made it hurt. The thigh cushioning made it slightly difficult to slide into the seat because it effectively raises the level of the seat (my car doesn't have fancy seat controls) and I had to wedge myself into the seat. The massaging feature was helpful because it was a fun thing to do on a boring drive and it helped a little to keep the circulation going, but it simply wasn't powerful enough to be really effective. The worse thing is that the thigh motor DIED only a few hours into my trip!! It has a 2 year warranty, but you have to pay a $5 "handling" fee! I'm mad at myself for throwing away the box because if I hadn't, I'd return it to Amazon and wash my hands of it.Overall, this cushion is underpowered, unreliable, and not as orthopedically correct as it should be. It is definitely not worth the outrageous price. I regret not buying a simple lumbar cushion instead. I wish I had saved my money for Homedic's highly rated Shiatsu seat cushion instead, although I'm somewhat leary of their product reliability now 
 I really didn`t think the photographs in this book were all that good. Some fine but oh so many poor. Many seem taken through a dirty glass so are blurred. Certainly a lot of photographs but it would have been better to have narrowed down by over hal 
 There are only two reasons to stick with this slow-moving story to its end: (1)you enjoy reading page after page of household and shopping trivia about upper middle class families who can afford vacation homes, or (2) you're curious to see if any real action ever takes place. There is no tension in the first half of the book; no suspense, no real mystery. The action is concentrated at the end.  The author employs a tactic used too often in female-centered mysteries; the murderer behaves like a gentleman the first time the protagonist gets too nosy, bopping her on the head but then delivering her unconscious body to her home.  That behavior truly requires suspension of disbelief.  Male readers in particular are likely to find the story terminally boring 
 If you are interested n this type of story, buy To Sir With Love or Boys Town instead. Dangerous Minds is simply boring and predictable with nothing to make it memorable. There are a couple of decent performances from some of the minor characters but that's not enough to raise it above the sad script and cliche ridden dialogue.  On the other hand, if you have no life experience, are very young or simply have watched very few movies in your life, you might get some enjoyment out of this. It's not really a bad movie, but it's certainly not a good one 
 This book is a farce.  It is  full of pages and pages of lists that are outdated and incomplete.  There is some SPARCE writing in the book that seems to serve the purpose of filling the space between the lists.  It is of no help whatever for someone trying to learn how to start a record company.  It is clear that the author has no understanding of this business beyond the knowledge that an average Joe band player  has  
 This book makes a lot of assumptions.  It assumes that the reader is EXTREMELY well versed in corporate tax advantages.  It assumes that the reader already owns a corporation.  It assumes that the book will be read with a dictionary of financial terms close at hand.  (It should be.  The book is poorly written, with key terms lacking adequate defenition.)  I support the Rich Dad series.  It is a great way for a beginner to get their feet wet.  This book assumes that the reader can already swim!  Even the seasoned incorporator would probably not be pleased with this book.  Tell you what, if you are considering buying this book, save yourself some money and just send me ten bucks.  I'll then call you (on my own dime) and summarize the book for you.  Oh, what the heck, I'll do it now, for free...surround yourself with a competent team of advisors 
 The snooze bar doesn't work with the nap timer. Otherwise, this is just an average piece of junk alarm clock 
 In the USSR, the state would havew a training class to teach children there is no God.  All the children (roughly the same age as would be reading this book) would have to put their heads down and pray for a cookie.  Then they were to lift their heads.  No cookie would be there of course.  Then they were told to ask the state for a cookie and then put their heads down.  When they did, someone would go around and put a cookie on everyone's desk.  This book uses the same sort of logic to make the reverse argument.  If it wasn't right the first time, it isn't right now, and what is terrifying is that truth and fact no longer have the weight they once did.    There is NO argument in the scientific community about evolution as others would have you believe.  There is an argument AGAINST the scientific community by people who no nothing about science, but know plenty about politics and law.  So your child may be reading this horror story in the near future so we can make our way back to burning women at the stake if they float when thrown bound and gagged into the river 
 About 4 pages of this book concern Zachman.  The rest of the book largely avoids any enterprise architecture topic.  The confused authors, and some reviewers here, do not understand the difference between enterprise architecture and software architecture.  The title of this book mimics the very popular PDF document "A Practical Guide to Enterprise Architecture", written for government EA practice.  It may seem odd, but US government practice is at the forefront of EA because the organizations are huge and the IT budgets massive.  Look for this PDF file on the CIO council website or www.egov.gov.  This begs the question of if the authors wanted to steal from the popularity of the earlier work and take advantage of those without a deep knowledge of EA- such as most programmers.  Missing from the book are things like TOGAF, FEAF, DODAF.  Also missing is the practical list of artifacts in Scott Bernard's EA3 book.   Come to think of it, get Scott's book, DODAF vol 1 & 2, the PDFs at www.egov.gov under the EA link, FEAF v 1.1 (PDF) and you will be far ahead of this confused mishmash of OO religion and EA misinformation.  I've been doing this for about 20 years, so I may be entitled to an opinion 
 You know, If I really wanted to, I could take a dump on film and it would be better than this 
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 I copied and pasted the bottom of this from another reviewer here.   I have not seen this DVD, but thanks to this person for not wasting my money.   For some dunb ass reason people that film so many shows do NOT GET IT!  we fans do NOT want to see a bunch of camera shots back and forth of the crowd!!  WHO, pray tell, when they are at a concert in person spends a bunch of time looking around the fans and not the show??? GET IT YET??  DOH!  simple!  Keep the cameras on the SHOW!  and DONT change from one camera to another every 5 SECONDS!  that pisses me off too to no end.   learn this, watch Roger Waters DVD in the flesh, learn learn LEARN!!!!!!!!!!  The concert was recorded with many camera perspectives although Ned O'Hanlon said in an @U2.com interview that the expenses on that show were just a small fraction compared to the expenses for recording the Boston show. The spirit of the entire show is captured very well, shots from and of the audience are used very often and reflect its enthusiasm 
 I was given this book as a gag gift. I regret the day that I actually read it. Here's the basic message "Be good.", it's nice that so many adults are willing to be maniuplated by a statement that has haunted them since Kindergarten. If you need a solution merely "Being good" is not a solution. Change something within yourself. Don't avoid the actual problem. And most of all DON'T preach about this book to other people, they might sucker-punch you, I know I would 
 I have my own personal barometer to indicate whether or not a book is second-rate (or worse).  I start counting the typos, and when I hit "five," I officially distrust the author/editors.  I hit five by the third chapter and knew I was in for a bumpy ride.  This author should have concentrated on spell-checking and fact-checking, rather than obsessing with his thinly veiled,homophobic assertions (as mentioned by another reader, his repeated reference to "Leo McCrary" nearly made me hurl the book across the room!).  This really was a maddening read, and it is hardly the biography that the great Gene Kelly deserves.  Makes one even sadder to ponder that Kelly's own autobiography was lost when his house burned down in the 80's.  That would have been a helluva read.   
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I've read several selections from Oprah's Book Club and have thoroughly enjoyed the vast majority of them, that's why it confuses me as to why this book should be chosen.  The level of writing borders between two extremes: overdone and shocking, and downright dull.  I generally do not mind subject matter that is lewd and shocking as long as it is coupled with strong, engaging writing, which this book lacks. With very few exceptions I found myself unable to connect with the main characters or the storyline.  I do encourage readers who may be new to the Oprah's book club to keep reading, not all of the selections are this bad 
 This is my first review for Amazon.  I write this so that some reader can avoid the pain I suffered.  The book was the worst mystery I have ever read.  Wild plot twists have been mentioned by others, nonsensical plot twists are a better description. I found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason I finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half.  This book was factually wrong in so many ways. Here are a few; 1) The prices listed were off. 2)College professors held office hours late on Friday afternoons. 3) Someone was paid with $1000 dollar bills.    I will give away one plot twist.  Someone has been stealing rare books for months.  Someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book.  The brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder.  I would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents' time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents' from discovering the youthful indecretion 
 A Dickens Christmas story is meant to be read in front of the fire with children gathered 'round. As configured in this particular ebook format you cannot do anything but sit in front of your screen and read ninety pages of nineteenth century prose. Not useful at all! This ebook would be far more usefull if, for example, you could copy or print it onto holiday paper. Since this story is in the public domain, blocking those options in this ebook is silly 
 College Professors Listen Up! This is not the book to use for teaching Computer Forensics and Investigation. I am a student in a graduate course for Computer Forensics. The fact that this book uses strictly commercial software for all the exercises is sad. Especially since there are many Open Source tools available that can be used to conduct Computer Forensics. The software included with this book requires that the buyer obtain a license from the vendor, before the software can be used. Then the license is only good for 120 days. This is not fair to the buyer especially for students, who usually have no intent of keeping the book past the end of the semester. It would be better to use a book for the class that the students would find worth keeping for the long term. Also, a book that uses Open Source tools for the examples/exercises, would provide much more value to the students. A much better book to use would be 'Incident Response and Computer Forensics, 2nd Ed' by Chri Prosise, Kevin Mandia and Matt Pepe. If this book does not suite you, then I am sure that you can find another book to use.   This book is better than the previous edition, but there are still problems with the information. As another student posted about a case project. The evidence proved the employee innocent. This is just the beginning of other problems that you will find with the book.  Buy at your own risk 
 I never thought I would end up liking the albums with Brian better than the ones with Bon Scott, but that's how it turned out when I listened to all of them. Really the only AC/DC album that I completely love is "Back In Black", it's obvious why it's famous. I was surprised to find that I hated every song on this album, the melodies have no direction but have the same repetitious guitar patterns and simplicity of all the albums before it. Thank goodness Brian took over, though I'm certainly not saying it's good that Bon Scott died. None of the albums with him on it are any good, although I can't say that about "High Voltage" because I have yet to hear that one. This CD, however, is simply awful. Really boring, I nearly fell asleep listening to it. AC/DC's a bit more popular than they really need to be, though I can see why everyone would wear "Back In Black" shirts. NOt recommended 
 This isn't funny. It isn't well directed or scripted. Perhaps it could have been great, if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director, but it didn't, so it turned out mediocre at best. Unfortunately, I believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and I to watch. I told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews I'd read, this was going to be a brilliant, hilarious cult classic. But now that we've watched it, he and I both know better. We know it's dreadful, and I can only imagine all the nice things I'm going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity. The only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and I got into halfway through the movie about where we'd seen one of the actors in the movie before. I'm pleased to say I won the argument. That was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me.  In my opinion this is not a 'hilarious cult classic' as others so often describe it. I don't know how drunk I'd have to be to agree with that assessment of the movie, or to find it even a little bit funny, but I suspect I would have to get smashed enough that I'd need a stomach pump afterwards.  If you want to see a genuinly hilarious cult sci-fi classic, pick up a copy of Flash Gordon. That has great actors, great sets, wonderfully campy scripts, brilliant humour, and a soundtrack by Queen. Furthermore, it has stood the test of time and is still great today, unlike 'The Ice Pirates', which has dated REALLY badly.   Better yet, get hold of some 'Red Dwarf' dvds...seriously, Red Dwarf is sci fi humour at its BEST! It's so good, it will spoil you for other sci fi comedies 
 Really, there's no difference in these two books.  They both have whiny main female "heroines" who invoke ZERO sympathy!  This book was not funny, not clever, and definitely NOT worth spending money on. I just don't understand how someone will stand for being stomped all over like this and does not quit...especially after all the extra "drama" that popped up.  All she did was complain about everything...just like Andy in DWP.  I don't know which book was published first, but the authors of this one and the DWP author had the same mind.  These books read almost exactly the same: young girl gets impossible boss.  Made to do unbelievable things.     The only person I felt bad for was Grayer, the son.  Poor thing. Parents uninterested in spending time with him even though he loved them deeply.  I just don't see how a book can be humorous when this was ones of the book's main points.    I was going to use this book to see whether or not the movie would be worth viewing, but I doubt I'll go see it.  If I do, I'll be using a movie pass or someone else will foot the bill.  Pass on this one 
 You really don't need this book.  Yes, there may be a few interesting ideas here and there but perhaps, it would be suffice to have a list of 50 to get you started thinking how to pamper yourself and then you can think of better ways yourself.  Okay, if you need some excuses (like "oh, the book said it will be good if I pamper myself this way"), go get the book.  Otherwise, save the money and buy yourself a real treat 
 To preface: I am a longtime fan of INXS and own everything from Listen Like Thieves to Elegantly Wasted. Elegantly Wasted is, in my opinion, almost worse than Full Moon, Dirty Hearts. Actually, I will definitively say it IS worse. There are the gems Show Me (Cherry Baby) and Elegantly Wasted, the title track, but the album quickly runs out of gas, runs together, and seems uniformly tepid, like lukewarm water. It doesn't rock the way INXS usually rocks. It attempts to experiment like some of the earlier projects successfully did, only unsuccessfully. There aren't the hooks or the tunes to redeem it. This is disappointing because I am a fan and I want to give the band an open ear and not condemn their work. But this album, unfortunately, stinks.  If you've ever seen INXS' Live Baby Live concert or listened to any album from 1985's Listen Like Thieves to 1992's Welcome to Wherever You Are, you probably concur that INXS was (and is, thanks to their newfound popularity with the Rockstar INXS TV show) a band capable of a great sound and a load of great songs. For instance, the entire playlist around 1991 was one great song after another. It was the pinnacle of the band's career. Michael's stage performance oozed with charisma and sexiness, Andrew's (and Michael's) songwriting was top notch, the band's arrangements were tight and good. And then something happened.  Fan reaction to X was much more tepid than to Kick, although X still sold fairly well. The band embarked on a successful tour. Around this time, grunge became huge in the global musical consciousness, and by the time of Welcome to Wherever You Are in 1992, the INXS sound was out-of-style. But ironically, that album contains some of the band's most diverse, greatest work.   INXS is releasing a new album soon with their new lead singer, J.D. I hope, and am confident, that it will be a return to greatness for the band. I believe that they can still crank out bitchin' tunes once again 
 The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money 
 Infected Mushroom are worshipped in the goa/psytrance scene and I can't see why. Their earlier material was a lot better, though certainly not 5 star. By the time they came out with this album, they lost most of the zanier elements in their songs for a cleaner sound that just doesn't have that much going on. The songs are melodic to the point where they are simply too cheesy and uninspiring. Their is a steady beat for dancing, but this song writing is simply  unimaginative. If I wanted to listen to regular trance or something really catchy, I would look elsewhere as others can do better and if I want psytrance, I'll listen to real goa on the TIP / Twisted / Dragonfly Record labels. I hear the appeal in earlier Infected Mushroom, but I can't for this one. As the title mentions, the production is great, but then that is true for lots of Pop (though this is not that bad). 1 star because its the lowest + 1 for production. 
 I don't really know what to say about this book. It's shocking and sad. It has summaries of horrible pogroms and covert ops gone really bad. I think the presentation just wasn't as good as I expected. The book even seems a little emotional. Granted, the author is talking about issues that are sensitive and morally significant. It just appears frustration gets the best of him sometimes in the book and that makes his "objectivity" suspect 
 Do not fall prey to this ridiculous hoax.  As one reviewer notes below, THIS BOOK IS A JOKE (as the names of the authors should tell you).  Not only is this book useless, but its entire sales apparatus (from the website to these very reviews [mainly written by the authors themselves, which you can tell by noting that anyone giving it five stars has reviewed ONLY this book and nothing else at all on Amazon])is designed to suck you in.  You would be very hard-pressed to find one serious graduate student who has read this book and found it to be useful.  
 I don't usually make a point to watch films this bad (predictable plot, laughable dialog, horrible music soundtrack, etc), but when I saw that my all-time favorite actor Jeremy Brett had a brief but memorable role in "Shameless" (originally titled "Mad Dogs and Englishmen"), I couldn't resist. It's a bizarre experience to witness an actor -- who so perfectly embodied the iconic Sherlock Holmes in the beloved Granada TV series -- appear in such an odd role of a drug-supplying sugar daddy. It's even odder to see a glimpse of him in a modern-day sexual scene with a young woman. Regardless, as usual, he stole the movie even if he was only barely in it. I only wished the director has used Brett to his fullest talents instead of as an aside eccentric.  A young Elizabeth Hurley makes a mediocre attempt to portray a bored little rich girl with drug problems and C. Thomas Howell does his best to seem sexy in a grunge biker kind of way. But Brett's booming voice, subtle expressions and dynamic presence wakes you up for just long enough to pay attention to his character. Once he disappears from the screen, you realize all too soon that the rest of the film is worthless. It takes a great actor to lift up a role from the muck, and I'm sorry to see that this was Brett's only chance to do a modern-day storyline from his usual historic epics before he passed away.  He briefly commented in an interview why he did the role, and soon realized the film was a disaster.  On "Mad Dogs and Englishmen" (1995)-- "I was mad to do it, but I wanted to show the world that I was still alive and I could do other things apart from Sherlock Holmes. I hope they don't release it..." 
 Actually the book itself is not "stupid." That argument is too subjective for this critic.  However, I would like to say that the authors of this book came to no concrete conclusions. And any quasi conclusions  they derived were founded on generalizations and speculation.  I would also  like to note that there facts and examples are sounds yet they apply in a  lose way that anyone with a high school degree can come to the same  conclusions they did. In short, any one with a paranoid mind and some of  the facts could have written this book 
 I very rarely write reviews, but I looked over a  few on here and realized I had to chime in.  I believe Faith Hill is one of the most brilliant country artists to come down the bin.  Take Me As I Am, It Matters To Me, and Faith were masterpieces of interpretation, vocal prowess, fully developed albums.  Faith Hill as an artist however began to go astray on Breathe.  Breathe was an album of phenomonal moments spread out over mediocrity.  With Cry, Faith Hill's search for new audience completely led her astray.  "Cry" and "When The Lights Go Down" are the only even vaguely listenable tracks.  The rest of the album is a mish-mash of pop-wanna-be songs that don't even begin to live up to the potential of the artists.  Sometimes fans become blinded by loyalty to an artists, and I don't believe it is fair to people to buy an album based on those opinions 
 I liked this novel at the beginning.  The cast of characters was good.  As comic relief I thought Hannah Goldsmith was great -- and, speaking euphemistically, the tension about progress, or lack thereof, in her love life was of considerable interest.    What killed the story for me was the coincidences: too many, too unlikely, too intrusive.  We are supposed to believe that Chief Inspector Detective Wexford has a very similar situation in his home to the murders he is investigating.  We have about every character and suspect in the novel being related to each other in one way or another.  By about page 250 of a 320 page novel I had had enough. The author had blown her believability.        Ruth Rendell is, of course, one of the best known of English detective novelists and has many loyal fans.  Perhaps she's written better books. I hope so.  But don't choose this one to read unless you are really, really a fan.      Smallchief    
 Thank you Mr. Corsi for bringing Iran into the forefront of nuclear proliferation.  This is an important subject and one that deserves to be under scrutiny.  However, the author has been caught plagiarizing recently.  So, one has to wonder about the integrity of any data in the book.  Read it with both eyes wide open and make sure you have a clear shot at the garbage can for a rimless shot 
 I was looking forward to reading this book after hearing so much about it from my colleagues.  While it was an interesting approach to the subject matter (especially in what i assume is suppose to be an academic book), both Behar and the book get tedious.   Although I appreciate Behar's efforts to relate her life to Esperanza's, somehow the book ends us being about "me, me, me."  She just goes on and on about how horrible Esperanza's life is, and how her life is very similar to it.  It comes off as a bit of a stretch, especially since Behar is benefitting by writing about the struggles of this woman's life.  The book is self-centered in a very subtle way.  But, by the end of the book, I just didn't care anymore about what happened to Esperanze, Behar or the book. There are both a lot of critics and advocates of this book.  I wasn't able to for an opinion strong enough to join any of those two camps 
 ... if Howard Hawks was proud of making this. Sure Cary Grant didn't seem happy playing this part. I can't think of any good actor who'd enjoy being lured into such a preposterous plot which should have got Sheridan some Oscar for impersonating one of the most insufferable bitches on the screen (there's no shortage, but very few were less funny) although the responsibility is more Lederer's disappointing script.   This opinion is for the first 15 min. only, since I don't know if it gets better afterwards, but I couldn't stand it any longer : the last 5 min (of the 15) were an ordeal. 
 I like Japanese films, and really wanted to like this one. However I must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot. Now I have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day. If that is true I might give it a higher rating. As of now however, there are just a lot of things that don't make sense 
 The ones that are posted twice do not work. If they are posted once, you can try to download it, but it might not work. The video only worked for about a minute. Shame, since I really like this show and I wanted Amazon Unbox to be cool. The one cent CSI works, go download tha 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 One reviewer said that "hatred sells," and I think that reviewer is correct in her assertion. Today's political pundits, I am convinced, find it hard to disagree without being disagreeable. Is this a new phenomenon? Probably not. The truth is that America's political landscape is not merely a place where people may find common ground, but it is now the site of many verbal assaults that, if these assaults were all weapons, words could not begin to describe the bloodshed they would cause.  Does it bother me that political correctness has hampered our efforts to fight terrorism in America? Indeed. It also bothers me that, if I were a person of Middle Eastern descent, or if I looked like a person of Middle Eastern descent, I would be an instant suspect.  While pundits fight each other about issues that can be settled (or not) at any other time, terrorists are taking aim at the planet to make it all their own.   
 Simply put, Jay-Z is incredibly overrated.  I own a couple of his CDs but to be honest, I never really liked him.  His beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me so much that I just had to go back and listen to a specific song again.  He mostly raps about drugs, money and cars.  Nothing special, nothing new. I'm just being real about it, since everyone else is on his d!ck.  I think the reason he's so respected is because he blew up right after Biggie died and he was the closest thing to him at the time.    Granted, Jay-Z does use some good metaphors, but for the most part his lyrics are shallow.   Best tracks on this album:  Can't Knock the Hustle Brooklyn's Finest w/Biggie Dead President 
 Land of Little Interest would be a better title; it looks like even old Cactus Ed didn't read beyond the first chapter.  All the references he makes in his introduction are from the beginning of the book, and he seems to ignore the rest of the book, as I wish I had.  Boring, unless you want to know about what grows next to irrigating ditches.  And I still don't know what the hell a "campoodie" is (a term used over and over), but, who cares 
 "I have received your new book against the human race, and thank you for it. Never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid. One longs, in reading your book, to walk on all fours. But as I have lost that habit for more than sixty years, I feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it. Nor can I embark in search of the savages of Canada, because the maladies to which I am condemned render a European surgeon necessary to me; because war is going on in those regions; and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves." Voltaire (1755 
 I was very disapointed when I read this book. I am a professional graphic designer and very interested in information design. This book is a paradox. A book about information design wrapped in ugly design. It is too big, too  selfabsorbed and seems to be oldfashioned too. A group og designerfriend  padding eathother on the shoulders. It is not woth buying, however the  book: "Information Anxiety by the same author is great, but has ugly  confusing design too, -I dont understand why 
 Since Good in Bed and In her Shoes Jennifer's books have continued to get worse.  Her first 2 books were fabulous but Little Earthquakes, Goodnight Nobody and The Guy Not Taken show her progressively becoming more boring.  I dont know if its because her life has changed and she is not having the fun exciting life of a single woman, but her books are not as good as they were.  The Guy Not taken is a compilation of short stories.  There are a couple of high points in the book but they are few and far between.  The problem with these stories is just are you are beginning to relate to the characters the story is over and you are moving onto the next one.  I will continue to read her and give her one more shot, but I am not sure how many one more shots I have in me to give to her.  
 I used it about 10 times in 2 years and it did the job well. Used it as blower and mulcher and was pretty happy with the results. Unfortunately now it smells like burnt everytime i use it. I opened it up the other day and it looks the like motor collectors are giving up. Not an expesive tool but it should have lasted more than 2 years of light use 
 OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.  Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?  Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.  I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook 
 An explanation of each dramatic situation would have been helpful.  However, the author only gives a list of works that a situation can be found in.  The book was not what I was looking for.  I wanted something to help me write conflict and plot.  Maybe it would be helpful if I shifted through the massive reading list the author provides.  Over all, I was not satisfied with this 
 I've read hundreds of business books over the years and this is probably in my top 3 worst books of all time.  I consider myself a fairly sophisticated real estate investor and this book gave me absolutely nothing.    Not worth anyones' time to read. Take a pass on this boo 
 I'd be okay with a story that had 1 or 2 last-second escapes, but this book has at least 10, if not more!  I think the author spent too much time watching action films and incorporated every single escape trick into one book.  Even a Bond film would not go this far out on a limb.  They only other Reilly book I've read is The Contest, which I suppose was just as far fetched, but I give that one more latitude since it was science fiction and this one is not.  Another complaint is that a 16th century manuscript is woven into the story - which is not a bad idea - but there was no effort at all to change the language to the appropriate era.  The book does have a lot of action though... so if you like wild adventure and can completely suspend reality, you'd probably enjoy.  Appropriateness:  I would like to have recommended this as a fun action book for teens, but be aware that it contains a lot of language and a lot of violence.  There are many gruesome deaths of all varieties.  There is no sexual content or discussion of it 
 I fell in love with Matthew Reilly's fast paced, action packed writing style with Area 7.  Since then I read Ice Station, Scarecrow, Temple, Contest, and now 7 Daily Wonders. Wonders was a HUGE let down.  Reilly seemed to allow his plot constructing abilities take a back seat to a Indiana Jones, run through traps, scenario that seldom made any sense throughout the entire book. The plot was more of a "Let me give the characters an excuse to run through the corniest traps I can think of" than it was actually well written or well executed.  In truth, I was SO reminded of "Pitfall" on the Atari 2600 that I found the book boring.   Even with the suspension of disbelief of "How do all these traps work after 4000 years?" I still wasn't happy with the do or die atmosphere that everything hinged on. On top of that, VERY unlike ALL of his other books, this book was a poorly veiled statement on his disagreement of current American military actions.  It came across as very anti-American and almost told me that he hated Americans.  I almost threw the book away during some rants of ethic superority, and America "sacrificing" troops "just to test the waters".  As to those who say, "Why not anti-American when normally it's anti-someone else?"  I say this.  This book attacked America as a people, as a culture, as a complete ideology.  Other books have bad guys/groups that are obviously separate entities from their cultures.  This book mentioned many many times how America is a country of war-mongerers, and the population really wants nothing but global dominance.  A far cry from having specific special forces units butt heads in a search for dominance.   Congratulations, Reilly, I doubt I will give you another chance 
 Ray should just live life as he really is and not try to rewrite history and make himself more than he is. He was a very great musician and an integral part of the Doors. Yet he seems to be trying to convince himself and everyone else in this book that He should have been the "Rockstar" and not Jim. 
 This is my first Barbara Vine (R.R.) novel. Very simply, it concerns a man gathering information about a Victorian ancestor, a doctor deeply interested in hemophilia. The story can be rougly split into three plot lines: the biographer's relationship with his wife, the biographer's duties as a member of the House of Lords, and the biographer's investigation into his relatives' lives.  All three plot lines contain an obscene amount of repetition about already-mentioned facts. Having edited in the past, I could have thrown out at least half of the book without a loss of plot focus. There was no "building to an exciting climax!" or "weaving of an intricate story!" as  has been indicated in other reviews. I had figured out the obvious "mystery" less than halfway through the book, and spent the next 200 pages wishing with all my heart that the narrator-biographer would get to the point already. I've read books easily two to three times as long, and much more detailed, and I haven't been nearly as bored to distraction as I was with this one.  The story lines concerning the wife and House of Lords simply made me want to shake the narrator-biographer - the man "comiserates" - whines - so much that you wonder why anyone puts up with him.   I've spent 30+ years reading books from all genres except fantasy, and I've rarely been so impatient with a plot. All in all, I don't think I'll be reading anymore Barbara Vine novels. 
 this is one of the most frustrating toys i have ever used with my child! it does not work : 
 Our Krups 199 was a wedding gift two years ago.  We loved it--until this morning.  See the "2 consumer photos" linked above?  That's my coffee pot.  It's the same story you've read from the other six people.  I contacted Krups and they informed me the Krups carafe in this machine is particularly delicate--you aren't to even use a sponge to clean it! I was told to wipe it out with a cloth.  Gross.  Suffice to say, if you don't like your fresh coffee to taste like moldy, stale coffee, go spend your money on another machine and carafe.  
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 i have read a number of dylan books. i found this one the most difficult to get into and appreciate. i tried to read it a couple of times but gave up. it seemed too complex and high-falluten [?sp].  maybe it's me. anyway, for what it's worth i truly loved CHIMES OF FREEDOM, DYLAN AND PHILOSOPHY AND CHRONICLES 1. GOD BLESS 
 This book is awful given its horrible and out of date questions, which are NOTHING like the real SAT II questions.  Also, the history is written in a very (VERY) baised view, with almost NO soical history (35% of the SAT II should be soical history).  Lastly, I am not sure if the authors are NRA members or something, but the overall sense I felt after reading the histor review was that anything liberal is bad and President Bush is the greatest president ever.  Buy a better book, go for the Kaplan or the Princeton Review.  P.S. I got a 790 on my SAT II US History by *not* using this book.  This book might actually drag your score down 
 Interactive?  My eye!  Only that silly video appeared, and there was only the On and Off buttons.  What.  A.  Gyp.  Disappointed 
 I have this little (very little) section in my dvd bookcase that houses bad dvd buys.  Currently "The Yards" and "Ghost World" are the only two dvds that are housed on that shelf.  I don't know what to say, except the preview at best buy drove me to buy it on the spot and I was extremely disappointed that night when I watched it.  Slow story, not enough character development.  All I can say is don't let it be a dust collector in your dvd collection, like mine is 
  Every time I use the product--- 3 out of 4 times I receive an error and have to try it agai 
 As several other reviewers have noted, this book is very deceptive.  I bought it on the spur of the moment, based on its title.  However, I soon discovered that 90% of the book is about the author's recuperation after a near-fatal auto accident.  His acccount of heaven is not only brief, but highly repetitive.  The same thing is said over and over, sometimes it's said in a different way and other times almost the same words are used.  Obviously it's done as a "filler", to make up for the lack of substance and to add to the number of pages about Heaven.  It's not at all convincing that Piper was clinically dead for 90 minutes. He says he was, based on what EMTs said on the scene.  But it sounds like the medical personnel came to that conclusion based on the severity of the accident as opposed to actual tests.  It's also very possible he was alive for the 90 minutes in question.  His description of Heaven borders on the fanciful....streets paved with gold, iridesent pearly gates, etc.  I suspect he experienced Heaven more or less as he would have expected, given his background as a fundamentalist minister.  Had he been of a different faith, I would bet his report would have been quite different.  This entire book could have been condensed for a publication like Readers Digest.  At least there would have been other articles and features to justify its purchase 
 This book was extensively researched.  Unfortunately, the end results of this research is a very dry and somewhat boring academic study of Chinatown gangs.  One feels that the author could have presented many "real life" stories of gangs and gang members.  Instead we read about statistics and academic views. What a disappointment!  I just wonder what a great book it might have been had there been more of a "human" look at the gangs 
 The color illustrations in this book are quite attractive and show that there was a lot of time, effort and skill expended in their creation.  However, the text was written on a far more elementary level than I expected .  It would be more helpful for the beginner than for an accomplished photographer seeking new methods and/or techniques to sharpen their interpretative skills 
 This has the overwhelming acidic taste that is characteristic of canned spinach, that frozen and fresh don't have. If you know what I'm talking about and like that taste, then this is OK, but for us it's inedible 
 My impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author's in this subject matter have ever presented. For eg., "People crossing hands in front of their chest means that they aren't accepting what you are telling them." That is the most typical statement I have ever heard, and this tape is full of them. There is nothing enlightening, nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape. I felt it was not good use of time or money.  Fo 
 Like all James Patterson's books, this was a good story idea, but poorly executed. Patterson's characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever, but the dialog runs from awkward to silly, and his pacing is often confusing and forced. That's why his books do better as movies: a better writer gets to use Patterson's concepts with more realistic dialog and good pacing 
 I think that Ms. Nunez bit off more than she could chew with this novel.  I really like the premis of the story - college roommates become best friends, and the more ambitious one in many way shapes the other. I was looking forward to the inevitable split between the two and how they'd find their way back to each other. But sadly, despite the length, I don't feel that these two characters ever really materialized. You find out precious little about the narrator. She has two bad marriages, and you don't really find out why she felt she would never find true love again after her affair with Ann's father. Her relationship with her children was never fleshed out, and you had no idea what she wanted out of life (other than envying a marriage and having a child of an early boss). As far as Ann, you learned everything about her really quickly, and then were told it, over and over and over again. Her political views and beliefs were in the forefront again and again. I can understand why some reviewers think that Ms. Nunez was just spilling out her political agenda from the Vietnam era. I'm not sure I can agree, but I sure didn't feel bad about being a materialistic person after reading this. Ann was not made very sympathetic. Until the affair with the father happens towards the end, you don't learn anything new, and then, you only learn a few antecdotes about her childhood that helped shape her. The book concludes with a long narrative from a friend of her's from prison. Even in this, you don't learn much about her. She's a tragic figure, not just because she's misguided in her efforts, but because Ann never developed after she turned 17.   The writing I found very disjointed. I did not particularly care for the long rambling section in the middle about the narrator's sister, with a SEVERAL page rambling love letter to Mick Jagger stuck in the middle. On its own, the story between the sisters from a bad home could have been beautiful. But sandwiched in between the relationship with Ann, it just took away from the opportunity to learn more about the protagonist. And the reconciliation between the two friends was contrived and wasn't worth having to learn so much about a sister that in the end was treated as an after thought.  Finally, I must comment on the letter from the "prisoner" at the end. Ms. Nunez is simply not a skillful enough author to pull off two different first person narrations in the same book. If one was to thumb through the book and read a random passage from the prisoner, it is only the setting of the letter that differentiates it from Georgette George. The voice of these two women were identical, rambling tones, word usage, etc. If this was the author's intent, it was totally lost on me. It just struck me as amateurish.   All in all, if you are looking for a book about friendship or even about college life in the late 1960s, I'd keep looking 
 I subscribe to Traditional Home magazine and have purchased their other  books.  Signature Style was a terrible disappointment.  It lacks the  interesting, informative style for which they are known.  Pictures and text  are below par.  Gives you the feeling this was done by some other entity  who dashed it off without much thought.  Save your money 
 I had just purchased the humidifier and followed all instructions to set up the system.  After running for 15 seconds, the machine's reset button started to blink, which by the way should only be blinking if it runs out of water.  Staring dumfoundadly at a full water resevoir, I followed their reset procedure only to have the same thing happen again...and again...and again.   When I called customer service, they explained that the only time the reset light will come on is if there's no water left in the resevoir or if there is a mineral build up on the heating element.  I explained that I had just bought the system less than an hour ago so there's no chance that there is a build up of any kind and that the tank is full.  Their response was to return it and bring home another system and try that one.  I am definately returning it, but will not be purchasing another bionaire system, or anything that has the bionaire name printed on it 
 This firm was advertized on Amazon as being in "color." A black and white version was delivered to me, even though I had inquired of Amazon if the film was actually "color" and Amazon had assured me that it was definitely color.  I knew the film was originally in black and white, but was swayed to buy the film in the belief, as marketed, that it had been colorized, which is what I was looking for. 
 Unfortunately this sequel to the amazing cult classic doesn't stack up to the original at all. Despite the disappointing movie I was very pleased with the DVD itself. It comes in a well packaged case and there are plenty of extras on the DVD to keep you busy. The product itself was very good, I wish I could say the same for the movie 
 I'm not much of a mystery, but was taking a class on the mystery novel at school and this was one of the books assigned. Maybe it's me, but it's always seemed to me that the detective should be responsible for the resolution of the case. Not here. Everything turns out nicely without the detective actually having solved the case. Furthermore, Spring's prose didn't do much for me. Her paratactic sentences felt forced, rather than displaying natural speech rhythms.  Not a satisfying read at all 
 I found this at a used book sale- I would never pay full price for it- and approached it with curiosity and skepticism. Do they have to account for every moment of Hari Seldon's thousand-year plan? How many Foundation books will there be? Anyways, there's a hundred pages of Sims of Voltaire and Joan of Arc. Two interesting characters from history but I hated them in this book. I thought I had enough of that sort of thing in the Gateway sequels. It leads up to a big debate between the two, and I was trying to figure out what the point was. Just when I thought they were gone and we can get on with Psychohistory, they come back. And then again.  In another endless section, Hari and his wife immerse into creatures called Pans, which I assume are some sort of primates, they are there, but not there, kind of like in the Matrix. So Hari was taking a Darwin-like approach to Psychohistory, and humans on Trantor evolved rather than spreading out from an ancestral planet? Maybe my reading comprehension is low and I'm missing something, but what a gross misjustice of a book. The literary equivalent of The Phantom Menace, the sorry prequel to a classic. If you can make it through the whole thing, more power to you. 
 Very dissapointing album for true Iced Earth and Blind Buardian fans!!! Nothing like "Heaven Denies" and "Blood On My Hands" from their debut album. So the bottom line is, this is not worth buying! 
 Tracks on this CD are very easily consumable. Two kisses the first song sounds very catchy but I don' t think it' s music. I don' t think he'd have  a chance in the US or the UK music markets 
 This my first review on Amazon but I was compelled to write based on my experience with this course. The first CD is fantastic. It starts off slow and gives you a solid foundation to build upon as you move from lesson to lesson. Within a few weeks of driving back and forth to work I had mastered all the lessons on the CD and could easily translate the English phrases in the final review lesson into Italian. I was confident and had a good grasp on building sentences and nuances such as how words changed when the subject was masculine or feminine. My opinion is that most people write their review based on the first CD.  And then I put in the second CD. I thought there was some mistake, as if I had switched to a completely different Italian course. The slow, clear speaking narrators were gone and replaced with fast talking Italians who didn't repeat anything, and certainly didn't give you time to repeat in the pause. The assumption appeared to be that I already understood the language and this was merely a refresher course. Within ten minutes I knew this was no longer the course for me. I listened to the entire second CD just in case this was all a joke and at some point they would slow down and actually help me learn Italian. No such luck! I have gone back to using the first CD for practice while I wait for the Pimsleur Italian course to arrive 
 I was scouting around for a new British crime series to start and heard good things about Peter Robinson. So, when I came across this second in the Inspector Banks series, it seemed like fate was telling me to dive in. However, I and my wife both found it a severely disappointing, utterly unimpressive procedural. I can only surmise the series gets better over subsequent volumes, because this is utterly average stuff.  Inspector Banks has recently relocated form London to sleepy rural Yorkshire and is still getting a feel for the lay of the land (following his first case in Gallows View). One day a retired historian turns up dead in a field near the village of Helmthorpe, leaving Banks with an old-fashioned whodunit. Pretty quickly, the stable of suspects is established: his widow (who inherits a nice legacy), his old friend and publisher, his mystery-writing drinking pal, his local GP and drinking pal, a local entrepreneur developer drinking pal, or the local folk singer he may have had a fling with a decade ago?   Like a latter-day Miss Marple, Banks and his plod underlings go back and forth from house to house, interviewing suspects and trying to tease a semblance of motive and opportunity from their statements. Of course, like the old-fashioned constructions of Christie, we are left with lots of semi-plausible motives and seemingly few opportunities. Banks is convinced the answer lies in a fateful summer ten years ago. Meanwhile, a local teenage girl brags about seeing something the night of the murder, placing herself in danger. Will Banks be able to get to the bottom of things before the killer strikes again?!?!?   It's all pretty bland stuff, and gimmick by which the murderer masks themselves is a bit of a groaner. The clues dovetail nicely, and Robinson's done a capable job of constructing a puzzler, but the story and characters are instantly forgettable. The writing is utterly without style or distinction and the Yorkshire setting never really came alive for me. It seemed a kind of generic green and pastoral land with insular people and cure stone cottages. All in all, very little to recommend here. 
 The problem with the Supreme Court is the same problem with virtually every U.S. institution, it is being coopted by corporate interests.  The watershed decision that started this process was the 1886 case of Santa Clara Country vs. the Southern Pacific Railroad, in which corporations were granted "personhood."  Since that time, the Fourteenth Amendment, among others, has been perverted by corporate lawyers to extend additional rights to Big Business, and we the people have been losing the legal structure to control these private tyrannies.  Founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson warned of this growing menace when he said, "I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country."  And President Grover Cleveland warned in 1888 that, "As we view the achievements of aggregated capital, we discover the existence of trusts, combinations, and monopolies, while the citizen is struggling far in the rear or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel.  Corporations, which should be the carefully restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the people's masters." A much more interesting book on Constitutional matters is Thom Hartmann's "Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights."  Hartmann also hosts a daily radio program that inspires the most thought provoking dialogue in radio.  I can't say the same for Levin's book or his show. In fact, I think Levin is consciously avoiding the more profound issues that people like Hartmann raise.  These more pressing issues are also raised in the award-winning documentary "The Corporation" - which is available on Amazon in DVD format. 
 I really wanted this recording to help me achieve deep sleep, and before using it I felt confident that it would. Unfortunately, after having this disc on during the past three nights I must report that it has not affected my sleeping patterns at all. I continue to sleep rather lightly, occasionally waking, and feeling tired and unrefreshed in the morning. Perhaps this recording has been beneficial for some, but don't expect it to be a guaranteed panacea for your sleeping problems. Most cable and satellite broadcast companies have a variety of music channels available, and I strongly suggest that you try leaving a New Age channel on at a low volume when you go to sleep; that will probably be every bit as helpful as this disc 
 There have been a number of powerful arguments made over time against the horrors of war. This book is not among them. Schell presents a rambling, naive, and trite rant in prose form, absolutely lacking any sense of structure or logic.   The core failing of the book is that Schell doesn't seem to understand what war is *for*. Because this reality is not addressed, Schells is unable to develop alternative mechanisms that address the core reasons for war -- and concrete alternative mechanisms are what is necessary here, not truism and tautology.  War in humans is similar to war in other creatures, primates, social insects, etc. War has always been a means of weeding out weak groups, of redistributing resources amoung humanity, of driving evolution and adaptability. Unless we develop the economic tools to achieve redistribution without violence, violence will always be the natural and *reasonable* final solution of those who find themselve to be stronger, yet who have less resources than others.  Despite the NY Times quote on the cover, there is *no* cogent argument in the book. A specific example: Schell claims repeatedly in the book that "nonviolent movements in Eastern Europe and in Russia [...] brought down the Soviet Union". Sure, there were nonviolent protests at the very *end* of the Soviet Union, and some major incidents over the years, but it is widely believed by economists that the Soviet Union was bankrupted by a  futile attempt to keep up with the United States in terms of the arms race. The USA could borrow money from the international capital markets to finance its cold war, the Soviet Union could not. America ended the war in massive long-term debt, the Soviet Union ended bankrupt. Yes, at the very end there were nonviolent protests, but these were a response to the fact that the Soviet Union was no longer able to function economically, not visa versa. Yes, some people in the Soviet Union protested, but rhetoric aside, it is clear that they protested because their standard of living was below that of the West, and they had been  told that "democracy" would make them wealthier. If the people of the Soviet Union had enjoyed greater prosperity than the West, there would have been no protests. This seems obvious.  Another example. Schell repeatedly cites and praises the nonviolence recommended by Christ, the nonviolence of Ghandi, and the nonviolence of MLK.  Schell seems utterly oblivious to the fact that in all these cases the nonviolence option was used simply because of the participant's lack of other options, in particular, military power. If the Jews had been kicking Roman posterior, they would have had no time for prophets of nonviolence. If the Indians were doing likewise versus the British we would never have heard of Ghandi. The same goes for MLK. In every case that Schell cites, nonviolence was forced upon the participants due to lack of other options: for example, the superpower "nonviolent" stalemate during the cold war. Nonviolence, then, became the most efficient option for the protagonists... not the most "moral" or "righteous".  What Schell fails to recognize is that humans desperately want to redistribute resources. It is one of the most basic and powerful drives we see in humanity. We will use whatever tools are most efficient for the task at hand, and in many cases the tool has been war. In other cases the most efficient tool has been nonviolent protest. In other cases the tool has been capitalism -- or communism. But to eliminate war, we must recognize that war has always had a legitimate purpose in the development of Man, and from there, we must strive to create more efficient options -- not merely blithely state that "violence [is] always a mark of human failure and a bringer of sorrow" and assume that any option developed will be preferable.  Not good 
 i was gonna make a point, but fabz made it for me  i was gonna say that nowadays an cd is considered tight just because it has a couple of hit singles  and Yayo's hit singles werent really hits  his songs were on the radio & tv for probably about a month or two  if thats what you call a hit then you crazy  the fact is it takes more than 4 good songs to make a good cd  he said that there were 4 hot songs on the album but failed to mention that there are 17 SONGS on the cd   a couple of good songs dont make it good cd  you want to see what other people think of the Yayo album read the reviews for it  and jeezy  please  he always been garbag 
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 I purchased these monitors thinking I wouldn't need to use them at all since the baby's room is right next door.  I'm glad I did buy them because my son ended up with acid reflux and spit up in his sleep constantly for awhile there, so being able to hear him and go to him is a comfort. Anyways, there are only 2 channels on these monitors, which is a bummer since I live in a big apartment complex.  I get interference of all kinds from telephone conversations to other people's babies crying, which really weirded me out the first time I heard it.  I tried using a battery with it when I brought it with me to check the mail (yes the door was locked, no I am not a bad mother) and was only able to hear static.  I wish I had bought a monitor with more channels.  Note to self:  keep reciepts and packaging from now on!! 
 I can't help by not like anything about this movie. The actors seem to be as uninterested in making the movie as I was in watching it.  I returned it so fast it made the cashier dizzy.  Skip this stinker. Trust me.  You'll have more fun at the dentist 
 I bought this item because other comforters from this seller had good reviews, but it was a complete mistake!  It really was dingy like described by other reviewer.  I returned it, but lost over twenty five dollars in back and forth shipping costs for this item.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS PRODUCT OR SELLER 
 I am so tired of reading IBS books that promise to help and don't deliver.  The book had the standard "eat bran" and "keep a food  diary" advice that my doctor gave. This doesn't help me. I also don't  want recipes for hamburgers and alfredo sauce when I KNOW that high fat  foods make me sick. The author claims she has IBS but if she eats the way  this book suggests I doubt it. I didn't learn anything new or helpful for  controlling my symptoms 
 We bought this for my son for Christmas, on the conditon that he never put fish in it, since the reviews said it killed fish.  That worked fine until he won a fish at the school carnival.  Of course it had to go in with the sharks.  So with freshly treated water and a prayer, we put the fish in.  The next day it was very listless and lying along the bottom.  After checking the reviews, I saw one where the person removed the fish and they recovered.  So we've taken the beta out and are waiting to see if it will survive.  I still would rate this aquarium 1 star for cool looks and lights, but it's very noisy and I believe it kills fish 
 While I thought that Ms. Warner's points were accurate, she spends the entire book going over and over the same points until one is simply tired of hearing about the problem with no idea how to escape it. I agree that many of today's famalies are over-scheduled and spending way too much time at daily multiple activities rather than living. This book points out a problem but does nothing to suggest how to combat it.   One quote from the book I found offensive was on pg. 25, "I had no qualms about eliminating those activities I found needlessly boring or stupid-like the lap-sit story hour at the nearby American Library..." As a children's librarian I guess I took this harder than others would. I agree that many activities could and should be scaled back and or cut, but perhaps Ms. Warner fails to understand that story hour is an effort to teach parents how to share books at home with kids. Of all the things to cut it is my hope people will opt out of soccer for a 3 year old and take a trip to the library once in a while. 
 Yes, I bought this book with the hope of increasing my hope regarding writing.     First, I was first disappointed by the style of the author. The text rambled with anecdotes, that began to repeat themselves so insidiously by the middle of the book gave up and went to the last four chapters hoping there would be some more helpful and encouraging matter. Unfortunately, those chapters read like the earlier ones.     Second, I was surprised to find ninety-percent of the text were anecdotes strung together about horrible trials of famous and not-so-famous authors. The anecdotes are depressing, not hopeful. Quite honestly, reading about hundreds of authors, each of who sounded like Job in their trials, was depressing. Given I wouldn't fancy myself as a future Grisham or Rowling or whatever, reading awful stories about how they almost didn't make it don't inspire hope.     Books I have enjoyed much more include Zinsser "On Writing Well," which melds interesting stories with great writing and instruction; Stephen King's combination autobiography and how to, "On Writing"; and of course, keeping track of the guest columns in the New York Times on writing.. 
 Does Turtledove devoutly wish the South had won the Civil War for its own sake, or is he just one of those admirers of Robert E. Lee (there were many at my alma mater, Vanderbilt) who can't bear that his hero came out on the losing side? Either way, surely Turtledove could have come up with a better vehicle for reversing the outcome of the Civil War than South African racists traveling back in time to arm the American rebels with yet-to-be-invented guns. The thugs of the 21st century have misjudged the motives of the noble South and the nobler-still Lee, but the general will accept their weapons anyway, thank you. This trick presages the wooden plotting and shallow characterizations to come. Turtledove's main non-historical character is a teacher-soldier who seems to come out of and return to nowhere, with no mention of family or background. Characterization in general has Turtledove stumped, so he turns to cliches, such as the prostitute with a heart of gold (this one masquerades as a male and dons a uniform to serve the Confederacy and service the main character). Turtledove even has a tragic mulatto woman on a postwar auction block. Blacks are few and rare in Turtledove's novel, and they are swept off the stage after the briefest of appearances, speaking only conventional phrases, and in dialect, of course. Both the rupture of the American Union and the continued births and deaths of millions of Americans in slavery (his Lee fashions a gradual emancipation in which blacks will "earn" their freedom decades into the 20th century) are treated by Turtledove as worthy of little more than a shrug. The more ambitious but nearly as wooden "alternate history" novel, Ward Moore's "Bring the Jubilee," at least was very sober about the consequences of a rebel victory. If you are going to reverse the outcome of a war so momentous in American and world history, don't do it as trivially as Turtledove has done in this book. There is potential for a great story in the fictional reversal of the outcome of our Civil War, but "The Guns of the South" is not it 
 Don't be misled.  Because Thomas Berry is promoted as a Catholic priest, many people are falsely led to believe that his books present Catholic or Christian teaching about the environment.  Instead, this book presents a New Age blend of do-it-yourself religion mixed with pseudo-science.  If you're into that, you'll probably like this book.. 
 As a general rule, any film with a large number of Roman numerals behind it is going to suck, and the eighth outing of the F-13 franchise, JASON TAKES MANHATTAN, obeys this rule to a fanatical degree. This movie is terrible, an utter embarrassment, and is noteworthy only as a study in corporate greed and marketing deception.    By the fourth installment of the series, the ironically titled FINAL CHAPTER, this formulaic slasher franchise was as exhausted as an old, blood-soaked boot. Jason Voorhees had outlived his usefulness and it was time for his rotted a*s to hang up the gaolie mask and retire. But the movie industry is an industry first, and when THE FINAL CHAPTER turned unexpectedly into a cash cow the studio execs at Paramount continued to flog their exhausted serial killer into progidies of meaningless violence. THE FINAL CHAPTER was followed by three more absolutely asinine sequels, which saw Jason improve the Crystal Lake gene pool by slaughtering legions of pot-smoking teenage dimwits. By this time P-mount was beginning to get embarrassed by their deformed, kill-crazy stepchild, yet the lure of an easy payday drew them on.   I still remember seeing the preview for this flick in a movie theater back in 1989. The audience ate it up. We actually believed that the producers had decided to tweak the exhausted series by loosing Jason in a place where he would probably feel right at home: the Big Apple. One could only imagine the bloody shennanigans Crystal Lake's least popular citizen could embark upon in New Yawk City! People were laughing out loud as they imagined him loose in the City of Lights. He could slay obnoxious Volcanoites! Teach rude cab drivers the errors of their ways! Annihilate the snotty salespeople at Tiffanys! Cut down on panhandlers! Convince grafitti artists to stay out of dark alleys! Run for mayor! We sixteen year olds LOVED the idea.  There was just one problem. The gang at Paramount had no intention of delivering on their promise. The ad campaign, like the title of the movie, was a fraud, and the only thing that got "taken" in this film was the money of a lot of bloodthirsty teenage dupes.  First of all, the first 60 minutes of this 90-odd minute movie are not set in Manhattan, but  in Crystal Lake and then on a ship called the Lazarus (get it?) which is conveying the usual cargo of teenage acting-skool dropout slasher fodder on a graduation cruise to New York. Jason, accidentally revived from the depths of the Lake by a jolt of electricity, stows on board the ship and proceeds to ch-ch-ch, ha-ha-ha his way through the doltish grads and the suspiciously small crew until the survivors are pursuaded to take a rowboat to Manhattan Island. Unfortunately "Manhattan Island", with the exception of a couple of second-unit establishing shots, is largely an unimaginative-looking soundstage on the Paramount lot populated by Central Casting New Yawkers, including the usual mixed-race mugger team and an Irish cop who says things like, "Well, ye seem loike foine peeple, so I'll not be arresting ye."   There is not a single scary moment in the whole film, and there are not even any particularly interesting kills. Kane Hodder's plodding, rotting, thoroughly over-rated Jason looks almost bored, as if he signed onto the cruise by accident, and then got talked into doing his mass murder shtick by the ship's entertainment director. To make up for the lack of any kind of suspense, the writers threw in a lot of gratuitous pleading for mercy from the female characters, and added nice little moments like a ship's crewmember talking warmly about his baby son right before Jason runs a harpoon through his body. Classy stuff, but really, everything about the movie is stupid, from the crazy deckhand who mumbles prophetically that the voyage is doomed (shades of Crazy Ralph), to the annoyingly cute little dog who has more acting talent than most of the victims. Hell, the climax of the film features a chase through the New York sewers, which, we are told, flood with radioactive toxic waste every midnight. (Does Rudy Guilani know about this?)  I realize having expectations for a Jason movie is silly, but even by the cellar-low standards of the franchise, this flick is a ripoff, a fraud, a dreadful fake, utterly stupid, appallingly bad, useless, terrible, and horrible. ZERO STARS. 
  This is a classic opposites-attract story in which Meadow Szarvas, a casual, down-to-earth artist falls for Devlin Fitzwilliam, a wealthy self-made CEO. Most of the story takes place at a mansion in Amelia Shores that has been newly converted into a hotel, owned by Devlin, natch.   I have some small and large problems with Tongue in Chic.  First the small problems: What is with the lame play-on-words title that in no way relates to the story and doesn't make sense on its own? And who is the elegantly dressed woman on the cover? Meadow doesn't wear an evening gown in even a single scene. Between the title and the cover, it seems as if the publisher is attempting to mislead readers in some way, and I have no idea why.  Anyway, my real problems with Tongue in Chic concern the contents of the book. The writing style is choppy and lacks transitions. The story does not flow smoothly from scene to scene.  For example, in the first scene, Devlin is described as "Mr. Arrogant" and as a "stern-faced, hawk-nosed interrogator." One page later, he is gazing soulfully into Meadow's eyes and calling her his "darling" and his "wife". When I re-read pages to find what I missed, I discovered that I didn't miss anything - the transitions simply weren't there.  Dodd's writing technique in this contemporary romance is a departure from her writing in her historical romances (of which I am a fan).  Apparently, I will have to stick with her historical romances.  My other main problem with the book is that so much of it required a suspension of disbelief. I should have expected some unbelievable aspects when the premise of the book involves a heroine who claims to have amnesia and a hero who claims that she is his wife. I think that Dodd is a skillful enough writer to make the premise more believable, but here again she cut corners so that it just didn't work.   On the whole, it's a thumbs down. Or should I say tongues down?  
 I loved the Disk 1,, it was great, I love the concept, the on screen scoring, the old and new mix of movies (All of us knew something, our 10 yr old, 14, 16, 19 yr old and us)  I HAD to get game two, got it cheap, was so excited... we just played it, and at least half, seemed like more, were the same movies represented on the first disk.  The questions were different, the scenes were different, but once you go through the same answers, it was more just trying to remember what last disk's answers were... I was sooo dissappointed.... Seems as though the company only got the rights to a few select movies,,, and had to rearrange questions to come up with same answers...  Too bad.. I was hooked.  
 Science fiction about the future is a window onto the era it was written in.  "Stand on Zanzibar" is about the anxieties of the 1960's- overpopulation, crime and chaos.  Science fiction from our era is dominated with anxiety about the environment and global warming.  Usually these anxieties prove to be unfounded, but they do tell us about what people were worried about. "Zanzibar" is a creature of the sixties, and if you haven't lived through that decade, you'll feel like you have by the end of the book.  William Gibson writes about the same sort of future mess, and does a much better job

 If you're of Italian heritage and you grate a lot of cheese, don't waste your time with this one.  When the quantity of cheese in the grater gets low, it tends to be very difficult to turn.  It also didn't last as long as I expected.  Try a different one instead 
 this book is okay for a beginners intro to iran but it misconstrues completely some of the facts of iranian history.  mossdaegh did NOT assume dicatatorial powers, and at times it seems that ms mackey feels sympathy for the shah.  the crimes of SAVAK, the shah's secret police, arent well documented either.  dont waste your money- I recommend THE LAST GREAT REVOLUTION by Robin wright or PERSIAN MIRRORS by Elaine Sciolin 
 When I got half way through this novel I asked myself: "Why am I reading this?" It's isn't very interesting. For the first time I can recall I fell asleep midday while reading this book.If a good editor had slashed the manuscript by 50% it might be more readable. My recommendation: Give it a pass 
 As a big proponent of a manned mission to Mars, I looked forward to reading this book.  While Baxter's characters showed a lot of promise, the slow pace of the story and lack of any possible conflict failed to keep my interest 
 I bought Cat Sitter1 for my 3 cats, they enjoyed it so much I gave Cat Sitter 2 a go. What a disappointment!!They were bored within 5 minutes of it being on!  The entire dvd is of birds and only birds as compared to Cat Sitter 1 that has a variety of animals that catches the cats attention span in short segments. Trust me, if you have to choose between the two, don't spend your money on on CS2, however, it may appeal to the (human) avid bird watcher...(?) 
 This looked like the perfect solution for using my iPod Video in my car for extended periods, however, this was not to be the case.  The first problem I had was that (as a few other people have mentioned) the plug was too large to fit firmly into the iPod when it was in the case that I have for it. I could manage to get it in but only with some jiggling.  The second problem I had was that the  sound quality from this thing is awful.  There is a substantial amount of buzzing and hissing caused by interference from the vehicle.  I ended up returning this item for a refund and purchasing the DLO Autopod car charger which works just fine.  The DLO is just a charger and doesn't have the audio-out plug 
 even if there were on option for 0 stars, i'd still have to consider giving this movie 1 star.  only because sarah michelle gellar is in it.  she's the only decent actor in the movie, which is never scary, never suspenseful, and completely lacks a plot.  it re-creates the scare scenes of the original "grudge" only they're not scary this time, because we don't care anything about the characters going through it.  a horrible waste of time, and this comes from someone who really appreciates horror films, even bad ones.  this movie made "the ring 2" look like a really good, really scary movie.  skip it.  don't waste your time 
 This book is not that great.  There are many technical errors and places where items were not cleaned up when there was an opportunity to do so 
 The player stopped working after only a few months - it would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to eject them.  That behavior started out as intermittent, but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go.  We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash.  Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping.  This one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether - what a waste.  Save your time and money and buy another machine 
 This book writes about people with Asperger's Syndrome as "abnormal" as opposed to people who are different than "normal" people. I personally feel that the nt's involved with  this compilation are all bigots and I don't think it has ever occured to  them or other nt's for that matter that we Aspies have a lot of bad things  to say about them. What makes them think that their sh-- don't stink. I  have Asperger's Syndrome 
 I read parts of this "book" until my intelligence was thoroughly insulted and I immediately returned it to the library. What a stultifying simpleton this man is. He is someone who wants to appear to have all the answers without having any foundation of intelligent ideas. And unsurprisngly, this dolt absolutely embarrassed himself during a recent appearance on the "David Letterman Show" and what made matters worse was just how oblivious he was to his infinite stupidity. First, he claimed that no one should criticize President Bush "because we're at war and it's no good for the country." Come again? I say that such a statement is "no good" for democracy, which is something this submental gasbag has forgotten about. The right to openly disagree with an alderman or a president is guaranteed by the First Amendment. And this man is a graduate of the John F. Kennedy School of Government? Also, he insisted that Cindy Sheehan, whose son was killed in Iraq, not have the right to be publicly upset with President Bush and the invasion of Iraq because "she's connected with left-wing elements in this country." What left-wing elements? I feel that Cindy Sheehan is as connected to left-wing elements as much as Bill O'Reilly is associated with logical reasoning. 
 Between the amended "politically correct" ending to this famous tale and the so-very-hokey interaction between Kirstey Alley and Lloyd Bridges, I couldn't wait for this to be over! The animation was very poor quality... the music was not the focus, my grandchildren lost interest. Shat else could possibly have been wrong 
 76:14, Remotion, Pentamouous Metamorphosis...THOSE are Global Communication albums. This is pure drivel comprised mostly of (C)rap and trendy house music that has been remixed. My biggest complaint is that I didnt buy this CD to fill my house with the shameful vulgarities that normally accompany (c)rap music (and I use the term "music" here very generously) and that appear here in a few of the "songs". I bought this CD because the title of the group on this album is GLOBAL COMMUNICATION, not Gun Master Nig*er Bit*h F*!ker!!!   There is NOTHING here that resembles the music that Global Communication has released under the name GLOBAL COMMUNICATION in the past! Knowing that Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton release music under other names makes me wonder why they didnt do so in this case? I dont expect the same old stuff from them (I was hoping that they actually had something new and interesting to COMMUNICATE) but packaging this GARBAGE into a CD released under the name GLOBAL COMMUNICATION is like packaging porn into a movie entitled  DISNEY'S BAMBI RETURNS....It just isnt right and quite frankly, is SUPER OFFENSIVE.   TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY for anyone expecting to hear Global Communication do something worthy of recording. Through ALL their releases (even the ones under other names) this is the most shameful, vulgar and deviod of anything remotely worthy of musical attention, thought or reflection

 We liked Vanessa in High School Musical, so got this CD for my two tweens.  It was a huge disappointment.  Her voice just isn't that good and the songwriting is pretty lame. I finally took it out of our car CD player because the singing is so bad.  She makes Hilary Duff look really good 
 I picked up this movie because I like Harrion Ford and I thought it might be funny. In my oppinon, watching it was a waste of time. The language was really bad, and Harrison's character had very low morals. There were a few funny parts, but nothing that stands out 
 For the naive (like me) this is a comic book in disguise! Apparently if reading is a challenge, you can turn to "graphic novels".  What a disappointment. I settled down for a long winter evening's read and was done in a heartbeat. Sure, there is plenty of violence, but the plot is thinner than Kate Moss.  On the other hand, if you can't handle more than 10 words per page, maybe you will find the plot challenging. As for the surprise ending -- even a ten year old gets tired of seeing rabbits being pulled out of hats 
 This book is more of an academic approach to the internal martial arts than th zen koan parable style I'm used to.  I'm sure if you spent months pouring over every page and looking up every 10 dollar word, you might  actually reap some benefit from this book.  But if you're looking for some  spiritual insight, some quaint story that will enhance your being and  improve your practise, look elsewhere 
 Sony Disc player does not work. It won't recognize disc in player.  Currently trying to get it serviced under warranty 
 Probably a first of its kind study about families with two-working parents.  However, the writing is poor, redundant and cliched.  The cases she presents don't suggest much variability except income and ethnicity.  Additionally, she skimps on a serious evaluation of what would make a successful household with two working parents and instead leaves us with the overwhelming feeling that success is almost impossible 
 I found the tales to be mismatched and the compilation rather dull. It is however better reading than a telephone directory.....I think 
 Badly written, badly researched, and offensive to women, Africans and anyone who's ever read a book over 150 pages.  I don't know where to begin. This man obviously never went to Mali, and I'd be surprised if he did more research on it than read the first two pages of a travel guide. His inaccuracy about the people there borders on criminal. If he had written such a thing about a Native American group, he would have been pilloried. He turns one of the few peaceful countries in Africa into a pit of corruption, torture, war and cruelty. This is a country that, in order to prevent ethnic strife, adopted the custom of "joking cousins:" if you come from one of my "enemy" family groups, I tell you you eat beans, and you tell me I eat donkey, and we both laugh our heads off.  Then we have Dirk Pitt. Where did this guy come from? A Saturday Night Live parody? Sweaty, hairy self-righteous manly man whose skin is impenetrable to bullets, crocodiles and apparently, the Sahara sun.  An incredibly self-satisfied, lazily-written piece of drivel 
 im not sure why i gave this a second star; maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman (the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious "adaptation"), this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer (john cusack) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz 
 I jotted down more than 200 words of notes on just the first 10 pages of this book, so egregious are its wrongs.  That includes lies told from within his own scientific field of expertise by anthropologist Vincent Sarich.  An example?  On page 9, Sarich claims that the Out-of-Africa hypothesis of modern Homo sapiens dates that to about 50,000 BCE.  This is not incontrovertible. To the point, anthropology shows modern Homo sapiens outside Africa long before that date. And, even if 50,0000 BCE is taken as the point for some final "breakout" beyond Africa and the neighboring edge of the Middle East, Sarich's idea deliberately glosses over "backwash" -- migration back into Africa, primarily from neighboring parts of the Middle East, but also from elsewhere. (Witness the colonization of Madagascar by people from south India in the last few thousand years.)  Besides, how can Sarich fit those "smart as a whip" Jews, living oh so close to "Darkest Africa," into this hypothesis?  More seriously, the Jebel Qafzeh skull from Israel is the most commonly known candidate for the oldest modern Homo sapiens skull ever found. It dates to between 92,000-115,000 years of age.  On page 1, the authors misinterpret a Lincoln quote about the difference between races, and infer that, rather than talking about the sociologocial fallouts from a clearly perceived difference in skin colors, Lincoln was talking about deeper differences in physical attributes.  The last paragraph of page 3 has a logically fallacious appeal to authority, which the authors continue throughout the first chapter of the book.  At the bottom of page 4, the authors appear to make a logically and empirically unwarranted jump, from all humans distinguishing other humans and classifying/chunking them into certain groups, to an almost Platonic-ideal concept called "race."  Page 9 - Going with their unproven -- and logically fallacious idea-generating -- 50,000 year date for the evolution of modern Homo sapiens, Miele and Sarich then use this to bootstrap their own arguments about the degree of difference between races, claiming this shows how rapidly human evolution can progress. It's clear circular reasoning based on an already assumed point of view.  Pages 9-10 have a laughably racist "genetic" rather than sociological assumption of evidence for various types of athletic prowess. (I await every new world-class African swimmer or hockey player to refute "athetics of the gaps" thoughts like this.)  More seriously, here's a sociological counterexample. Chinese children, and adults, are known from research to have an above-average percentage of musical perfect pitch. Genes?  And, the piece de resistance on page 10 -- the "mean sub-Saharan African IQ of 70." All together, now, can we say Bell Curve?  How ironic that coauthor Miele is a senior editor of Skeptic magazine, because this book warrants incredible amounts of skepticism 
 Looking for my first MP3 player, thought something small and inexpensive might be where to start, so got I this one. Big mistake. The screen was just impossible to read (TINY in EVERY WAY) and the included instructions were utterly useless. I'm not sure what purpose the CD serves because I couldn't get anything from it but warnings about possibly screwing up my laptop if I continued and error messeges. I know there are 8 year olds out there who could figure this out easily but I really need something simpler to use and easier to read. I am going to return this and try something that is about twice the price 
 I have been a Dean Koontz fan for years. When he is at his best, heis books are VERY good. I used to think that even when he's formulaic, at least his books are always entertaining. Recently, I've had to reevaluate him. He can write books that are bad. I was disappointed by "The Taking", and now this... I've been listening to this as an audiobook, but now I'm turning it off. I usually don't write reviews on books or films I don't finish, but this one, I had to give up and feel abliged to warn others.   I made it almost halfway through the book, waiting for something to happen. I really don't care to know how the story ends because it's hardly started yet. There are several parallel plots, all overwritten, with long portions of text where nothing happens and too many characters that feel not realistic, but constructed to be likeable and/or funny. I've always liked the way Koontz writes characters you really get to know and care about, but this time it's way too overdone. They can't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves and have endless dialogues that doesn't move the plot forward. Something must happen for a book to be interesting.  I was a big fan but I'm going to be very cautious about his books in the future. I'm not going to waste more time on this one. Not recommended even (or perhaps especially) for Koontz fans. 
 I started this book with gusto.  The writing was well done, the character's well developed, the speed moving along nicely.  The first couple of chapters had quite a bit of action and was a page turner...and then middle of the book-bam...nothing.  The story gets slooooow.  Suddenly the author is going on and on about things in the characters lives that are uninteresting and of little point.  The action dies completely.  I struggled on, thinking it would pick back up, but gave up on the last 70 or so pages.  I didn't even have enough interest to find out what happened to the characters and just felt cheated at having spent the time I did reading it.  Would not recommend 
 Don't get me wrong.  I like Stephen Hunter's work. However, with Pale Horse Coming, he achieved something that almost no other writer ever has.  He put me to sleep.  I actually could not finish this book . . . and I tried . . . I really did.  The first half of the book isn't bad.  It basically chronicles the suffering of Hunter's main character Earl as he copes with being trapped in a brutal Southern prison farm. This section of the book features one of the most innovative suspense sequences I have ever read: Earl is trussed up, weighted and tossed overboard. As he sinks, he realizes that he is among a forest of murdered corpses that have met the same end.  Great, right?  However, after Earl's escape, everything goes south (pun intended).  Earl escapes . . . I won't blow the means.  Then he decides to go back the the prison farm and clean house.  In an agonizingly boring and extended sequence, Earl recruits a bunch of aging sharpshooters to assist him.  They include a guy named Audie who is, yes you guessed it, an Audie Murphy clone.  The aged Wild Bunch also includes a guy in his 80's confined to a wheel chair.  The interminable mini-bios of these guys are pure agony.  If you want to read Hunter at his best, run as far as you can from Pale Horse Coming.  Give one of his other Sniper classics a try . . . or treat yourself to Dirty White Boys.  That book really rocks 
 This book doesn't include any text about stairs. I guess most complete homes don't need stairs. I find this book more of a coffee table book than a book I can count on for howto information 
 I'm going to assume the book "I Captured the Castle" is better than the movie.  The cinematography is excellent, and the acting is decent all around except for the lead character played by Romola Garai. In her most dramatic scene, a confrontation with her father, she played out her emotions in an over-slow, melodramatic manner like a bad, bad stage play.  I'll give her a break because this is one of her first films, but thank goodness Bill Nighy carried the rest of the scene. The funny thing is when you listen to Romola during her interview in the special features, you think "Why couldn't we get this part of you in the film"?  She's an intelligent and witty woman, but her performance as the lead character was just underwhelming. That's a horrible shame.  The lead always sets the tone for the film. This would explain why the movie seemed to drag.      I found this film to be a bore despite the wonderful talent.    
 Well, I was also disappointed that certain songs were missing on the soundtrack. I do not however think it's fair to say this is a CD only for Blacks because it's all rap! That's ridiculous. But, I'll overlook that naive comment & say, even for those of you who do like hip hop, there were some good hip hop songs there that were missing. I loved that song they played while they were out on the basketball courts playing one-on-one (Let 'em Fight?). That's the song I wanted the soundtrack for & I was so disappointed. As for those of you interested in that Lynyrd Skynyrd song playing during the car chase, it's called, "Saturday Night Special." The soundtrack wasn't bad, just a disappointment. To see all of the songs that were played in the movie, visit: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398165/soundtrack 
 Author devotes 2 pages to mathematically prove & philosophically justify that a manager should chose the highest NPV project before chosing the next highest NPV project.  Such logic continues ad infinitum throughout the 800+ page text.  Time for 3rd Ed 
 Wait...Hold On, before you say that this review is not helpful, let me explain why I gave this such a low rating compared to everyone elses.   I'm a fan of MF Doom, and have been listening to his music going back to his K.M.D. days. I also enjoy Madlab and his beats. The fact is that there are major problems with this album. First I seem to have noticed is that Doom and Madlib can be at their best sometimes, but at other points at this album, be at their worst. When hearing "Meatgrinder", I feel that tracks like that could have been better. Madlibs beats fail also, like on the track "Figaro" & "Shades Of Tomorrow". You and I know that he is capable of much better (see lootpack and any Quazimoto album).  Second, and many reviewers have pointed this out. I've gotten the perception that many of these tracks weren't put much thought into, because of the fact that the majority of them clock in on average of 1 minute and a half. Doom has picked up a bad habit of that also (see Dangerdoom album for more examples). Spitting one verse may cut it to some listeners, but it just doesn't cut it for me. It feels like it wasn't enough time to be put into this album. Point blank.  Now there are some points here that I highly enjoy. "Raid" featuring MEDaphor was dope and is one of my favorite tracks on this album. Also I enjoy the Madlib rhyming "Hardcore Hustle". MF Doom's rhymes are excellent on many songs also, like "Fancy Clown" (although thats another minute and something track) as well as "Rhinestone Cowboy". The interludes were kind of creative, as one sampled the old Street Fighter II game.  I see the 5 star ratings on this album, and gotten the feel that they'll just accept anything because it's not mainstram and pure underground. True, if I were in their shoes, I would have done the same thing. But I'm objective enough to realize what makes a 5 star album, and a bunch of 1 and a half minute songs just doesn't cut it for me. Maybe it's because I've gotten used to hearing him under the name Zev Love X under a group called a Kause in a Much Damaged socitey (on which I discovered early this year, and this album 2 months ago), and felt the need that he could do much better. I know thats hard for many people to accept that, and I'm going to be labeled a hater, but I have to call it down the middle on this one.  Lyrics: C Production: B- Guest Appearances: B Musical Vibes: D Overall: C  Favorite Tracks: Raid, America's Most Blunted, Hardcore Hustle, Fancy Clown, All Caps, Rhinestone Cowboy  Honorable Mention Tracks: Do Not Fire, Strange Ways  Peace Everyone!  In response to Ultimate Flow's Review: MF Doom is far from a wack MC. Have you heard any of his previous work and his other albums? I'm one of the very few MF Doom fans (and Madlib fans also) that will actually admit when either one of them puts out a wack album. This isn't wack, but it's far below their capabilities 
 Appalling - I only kept reading because I just couldn't believe it was going to be so bad all the way through! Just a list of complaints about food, hotels, everything he encountered, from London and Cardiff to the Isle of Mull in Scotland. Basically, for him, nothing is as good as America so it would have been better if he'd just stayed home. Also, there are several mistakes, particularly in his use of Welsh. Why didn't he do some proper research? And who needs to know about his medical problems or all the affairs he used to have (because he got bored with his wife early in their marriage). This poor woman was still being dragged around with him to see the few stones he got around to mentioning, all those years later. I read up to the bit about how this ego-on-legs felt he was being used as an instrument of God and that was it - I couldn't stomach any more. (Try Julian Cope's "The Modern Antiquarian" instead if you are interested in standing stones with some legends thrown in. It's a wonderful book written by a truly sensitive and INTERESTED author. 
 The only reason I subscribe is i found a free subscription somewhere. The magazine had some interesting articles but Most of the time they are just completely wrong. One example was a preview to last years NFL draft. They talked up Terrell Suggs in a long article to the point he was definetely going at the latest third even with the quaterback needy Bengals and the lions who really wanted rogers were finding it hard to take a pass at him. Where does he end up? Going to the Baltimore Ravens. Not even his homestate team the cardinals wanted him. Another example is the cover of the their college football preview. They picked Auburn to be their national champions. I don't follow college football enough to understand, but I know auburn lost its first two games and doesn't look much like a team vying for a national championship. I'm not saying that Sports Illustrated is perfect and their picks are always accurate, but they seem to me to get a better grasp on sports. Yes Sports Illustrated has ads, but looking through my last issue it doesn't seem that  The Sporting News has any less. It takes a while till you get at least two consecutive non ad pages. It seems like they both have the same amount. And even if One had more ads than the others is it that hard to really turn the page? Are you that lazy? The articles are the important thing and not many people say that the ones in Sporting news are better. I'd like to hear what some people thought were so nonsports related in sports illustrated. I personally haven't seen anything non sports relat1ed. Yes they have reviews of the occasional sports themed book and movie but they are usually short just letting fans know whether its worth it 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 This book takes what can be a great experience and McPilgrim's it . . . The writing is wooden, and the depth is about as thick as the meat on one of those teeny basic hamburgers. The only reason you would read this is to get a list of sites you may want to research elsewhere.  For travel to sacred sites, see such well-written and inspiring books as Phil Cousineau's Art of Pilgrimage and Sarah York's Pilgrim Heart -- don't waste your money on this one 
      Set in the soot covered trash strewn workaday streets of 1980s Istanbul, a man adrift without any depth of his own personality is abandoned by his wife, which rouses him to a realization about himself and a personal search that ends with him adopting someone else's identity.        This book was written for a Turkish readership; the references to the Ottomans, Muslims, the West, Turkish politics, the Turkish police and legal system, and the lost feeling of the current Turkish culture, are from a native Turk's viepoint woven tightly into the story.  It starts as a disappearance mystery only to quickly bog down into a saga of self-doubt, self-examination and despair.  It becomes progressively harder to read and requires an effort to wade through to the finish.     If you haven't read Pamuk start with I Am Red; if you have read that read Snow before The Black Book.  If you have read Snow, rate this 1.5 to 2 stars below Snow as it is so hard to get through (for example towards the end there is a rant by a character regarding a complex aspect of Turkish culture contained in one paragraph that is six pages long).  A thick, dark, heavy soup made of culture, history, loneliness, religion and escapism; if you are Turkish you may find it savory and reminiscent of home 
 The first four songs are very good, extremely catchy. Unfortunately the last 8 aren't, in fact they are down right awful. I like Gwen, she's probably the most beautiful woman in the world but she should have stuck with No Doubt. 
 This was my first Robert Ludlum novel and I am seriously disappointed. I don't know that I'll even finish it.  Characters have literally had the same conversations multiple times, as if the author isnt sure we were paying attention and they better summarize the plot again, just to be safe.  The writing itself just tries to hard and is, in a word, lame.  Sample line: "He crossed the room to the sink and picked up the dish liquid, Dawn, and poured some in the sink." Like we need to what brand of dish soap it is(!)?    From the summary on the jacket, this novel sounded promising. Instead, I'm fighting to stay awake, not caring if they ever catch the bad guys. 2 out 5 stars because I've managed to hang on more than half way. 
 I'm sorry that I bought this book.  The grammar is terrible, and the author (or his editor) doesn't even know the difference between principal and principle.  The author cannot settle on one word or phrase for a concept, but generally, and repeatedly uses three.  Save your money 
 For people that had tryed many ways to lose weight, that book is useless because contain no new information about how to do it. The method is less food, low calories and more exercise, just it. It has a few informations that can help understand how the metabolism works. 
 This book was published too early. By that I mean, Java EE 5 was not finalized so the code examples starting in chapter 9 don't work. Another example is chapter 10 titled EJB Entity Beans. According to the Sun tutorial, Entity Beans have been replaced by the Java Persistence API 
 The ties that binded this mythology together begin to unravel.  As I enjoyed the first three, it is a sad thing to have to say, but the characters leave much to be desired, the story is splintered, and the brutality is often unnecessarily gruesome. Loose threads remain -- who are the people of the forest?  Where did the enchantress come from?  And was it really necessary to tie this vision to an 'old earth' which did nothing for developing the story 
 I am still not convinced that Paul is not the great villian and founder of the new religion called Christianity. Just read the book called "Mythmaker: Paul and the Inventions of Christianity". I thought this book would be more convincing. I wasted almost $10 on this book. That money could have gone towards better use such a charity donation. I am going to be more careful before I purchase religious books (especially ones that claim the Christian way to be the only way backed up by evidence). I am stupid for making this mistake twice.  All I can say was the author needs more citations to back up his findings that Jesus (not Paul) was the actual founder of Christianity. I wasn't amused by all his citations in the back 
 Our protagonist is over his head, and below my serious consideration. The book ends on a "Aren't we great" theme (hardly surprising) and the protagonist really in over his head.  I got tired of Jake's continual self-effacing comments, which makes the ending even more implausible. He's a nice guy, which seems his total claim to fame. I cannot seriously recommend this book to a friend 
 This book does have alot of different dips, but not much info on how to have a fondue "party".  It doesn't explain in detail the equipment you need or how to set everything up.  The only good thing about the book is that there are lots of pictures for preparation and presentation of the dips 
 There is a review further down this page that is purportedly written by the author. If this was indeed written by the author, he should be profoundly ashamed of himself.  This is what Michael Burleigh has written in the review below in regards to the criticism offered by one of his readers:   "In cyberspace every moron gets a coconut. One big electronic democracy? Many of my US readers appear to need dictionaries. People don't in the fifteen European countries my work is translated into. Nor did I as I wrote the English language. My book is about Europe. Maybe try living there before you presume to comment on it?"  This is one American who has no intention of putting any money in the pocket of someone who holds me and my fellow countrymen in such open and unbridled contempt. And you have to shake your head at the effrontery of the author as he rates his own book with 5 stars 
 We are a group of fourth graders from Mrs. Larson's class at Sunset Hill School in Lawrence, Kansas. Most of us thought parts of this book were boring. We thought the ending did not close out the story well. We felt there was something else going on in the story that the author didn't tell  us. The illustrations did not stand out and were difficult to understand.  If you looked at the illustrations they would not make you want to read the  book because they looked so sad. We also didn't like the story because the  characters had too much anger. We also thought the story should have a  happy ending. As it was it felt like the author had just stopped in the  middle of the story. Some people might enjoy this book but we didn't 
 Like several others, I bought this book because of the glowing reveiws. I simply could not be more disappointed.  The book is not at all easy to follow, laden with errors, and backwardly stated sequences -- you are told to do something, and then told, after you do it, to do something else, first. Just think if this sort of instruction was all you had were you attempting to defuse an explosive device: "Now, cut the blue wire. You should, first, cut the red one, or the device will blow up in your face." Not the best way to sequence things, is it, as you are likely to be proceeding one step at a time.  The code, as presented in the book, is incomplete, despite the author's having said that you can, if you wish, type the code yourself (which I prefer to do for learning purposes) rather than simply downloading it. Additionally, the reader is told to employ menus in Visual Studio to access selections that simply are not there.  Worst of all, the book presupposes a level of expertise on the part of the reader such that it comes across in actuality as one pro talking to and offering advanced-level suggestions to another pro. If, however, you do not as yet inhabit so lofty a level, you should know that the book presupposes that you already know and know well what you bought the book to learn. The book is extremely verbose; seemingly, for every line of coding presented, there is page upon page of novel-like reading. This may work for some; others, however, prefer a straight-forward, concise, clear and hands-on approach. There is no teacher like experience, and material presented in a wordy, essay-like fashion does not readily invite follow-along, learn-as-you-do instruction, which is the most effective way to acquire a skill.  To those who found the book so favorable, I offer congratulations for having discovered a volume of information that has, according to their reviews, worked so well for them. I, however, simply do not happen to fall into that category, wish though I may I did, and am constrained rejoin those who must go on wishing that once, just once, a good, clear, concise, reasonably error-free and genuinely instructive book on C# & ASP.NET would make it to the market place. Until then, disappointment and frustration of the sort engendered by this book and the all too many like it will continue to make learning web programming much more difficult and time-consuming than it must be 
 this DJ plays music that I can hear in a bus, in the subway or even in the slumberest parties! I just hate that he and his music is the most comercial in the entire planet earth. Come on boys, put some bad reviews, was not helpful? your so not into this kind of music, that can tell 
 I should start by saying I am a big Clive Cussler fan and have read all his books.  The only ones I have not enjoyed are the two Oregon Files ones.  There are so many characters I could not remember who was who without having to keep looking at the cast list at the front.  I reached the point of not caring anyway and just kept reading to get to the end.  The whole thing reads like a Mission Impossible TV episode but nowhere near as good or exciting.  The scenes in the UK were very sloppy; there are no such things as pound notes and the beefeaters actually guard the Tower of London not Buckingham Palace.  I can only hope that it is Craig Dirgo that is the problem and that when the next Oregon Files book comes out written by Jack DuBrul (who I am a great fan of in his own right) that things will improve 
 Both musically and creatively Luca Turilli is, in this disc, under himself. The trilogy project started well, «Prophet of the Last Eclipse» meaned an incredible quality jump, and logically the waited «punch line» created great expectation. But then, «The Infinite Wonders of Creation» happens. And what a disappoint. The sound here is totally different in a bad way, likewise the style. What we love in the previous albums --brilliant passages, emotive choral segments, interesting themes and stories, the fast and furious drums, among many other things-- is now disappeared. Definitly the trilogy is not well closed; Turilli is in debt with his exquisite work. «The Infinite Wonders of Creation» is not one of them 
 I am Christian, and I also have been diagnosed with depression.  When I received this book, I opened it expecting anecdotes and little things to do in my daily living to help me get through my depression.  However, the book  focuses entirely on Christianity.  Phrases such as "The person who is  depressed should ask himself what he is doing to make himself depressed.   He may discover that he is living a lifestyle that is clearly against  God."  For those to which this statement applies, the book could be  very helpful.  The authors believe that depression is some sort of mindset  that can be easily overcome, not a real disease that millions deal with  daily.  If you want tangible ways to overcome depression, beyond prayer and  an active relationship with God, then look elsewhere 
 This product is not what its cracked up be, if looking for a screen protector, look elsewhere.  I can use the cloth and clean my own screen which is great but the screen protector really makes the screen look bad.  Waste of $10 and customer service won't respond to my email, matter of fact, email to customer service didn't ever deliver 
 Which of the following statements are true:  a)	René Descartes invented the Cartesian coordinate system to track the movements of a fly on the wall.  b)	René Descartes was messy.  c)	René Descartes absentmindedly fell into the Seine.  d)	None of the above. The correct answer is "d)." Unfortunately, the author of this pseudo-biography, tells an engaging story, which incorporates all three statements. The fact behind the fiction is stated in the Author's Note section on the final page (48), where we learn the only two undisputable facts in the entire book: "...René Descartes made the Cartesian Coordinate System very popular. And he was a darn good philosopher, too." The remaining pages are filled with speculation. Although the illustrations are very good, and the book's explanation of the Cartesian coordinate system is comprehensible, it seems pointless to provide a fabricated story to a seven to nine-year-old child, to whom you must at some point say, "It isn't true." 
 And by REAL AMERICAN HISTORY, I mean empirically observed and verified facts, not some over-exaggerated facts created by some die-hard socialist with an ideological axe to grind against capitalism, which just got picked up by government propaganda artists and regurgitated by public school teachers and textbooks, such as the person below:  "Mr. N. obviously still thinks this book is complete fiction and has probably never had a United States history lesson in his comfortable life."  First of all, the book is widely cited as being responsible for the Meat Inspection Act of 1906, yet there was a previous Meat Inspection Act passed in 1891, practically fifteen years before the Meat Inspection Act of 1906.  In the time since there grew to be hundreds, if not thousands of employees at the federal, state, and local levels.  After Upton Sinclair wrote, had published, and had distributed The Jungle, the United States Congress at the time (specifically the 59th Congress) had a (now pay particular attention to these next few sentences class, as they provide far more factual information than your textbook describes) Congressional Hearing for their first session in June of 1906 where on page 194 of their Hearings on the So-called "Beveridge Amendment" to the Agriculture Appropriation Bill, where Indiana Congressman E. D. Crumpacker of Indiana noted in testimony before the House Agriculture Committee that not one of the hundreds of meat inspectors at the federal, state, and local levels "ever registered any complaint or [gave] any public information with respect to the manner of the slaughtering or preparation of meat or food products."  There was even authoritative 1906 report of the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Husbandry written. Its investigators provided a point-by-point refutation of the worst of Sinclair's allegations, some of which they labeled as" willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact," "atrocious exaggeration," and "not at all characteristic."  On top of all that, there were millions of tourists visiting the Chicago stockyards each year, plus thousands of workers who at one time or another worked for the Chicago Stockyards.  So how come it took one lone, heavily die-hard socialist to reveal this all?  Or could it be that it just made it all up and greatly overexaggerated in order to push his socialist agenda?  After all, it was Theodore Roosevelt who wrote about Upton Sinclair in his letter to William Allen White in July 1906, "I have an utter contempt for him. He is hysterical, unbalanced, and untruthful. Three-fourths of the things he said were absolute falsehoods. For some of the remainder there was only a basis of truth."  It is ironic that Upton Sinclair then decried the Meat Inspection Act of 1906, as he saw it for what it really was, a move to give more power to big business who got the taxpayers to pick up the entire $3 million price tag for its implementation as well asnew regulations on their smaller competitors, and another myth entered the annals of anti-market dogma.   "The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair is a novel that illustrates the blunt reality of accurate historical event of the 1920s"  No, as I've just pointed out, it was largely fictional propaganda, just like Michael Moore.  If you really want to know how bad things were like during the Industrial Revolution, then ask yourself why we constantly had newer and better technologies available to the public and dirt-poor people like John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, and others constantly fulfill the American Dream, which happens a lot less in America thanks to all of the government controls on the economy 
 After seeing the first series, I thought (hoped) that intelligence had started to find it's way back to humor. With the second series, I see that I was wrong. Horribly wrong. In the former, we were introduced to these characters, and with each new scene, a new quirk or tidbit was released to us. In the latter, there is no development at all. It is formulaic. The characters basically do the same thing, again and again, without even much of a change in scenery. Messrs. Walliams and Lucas do not challenge themselves to broaden these individuals in the least, which I find all the more egregious because they have an unerring eye for detail. Perhaps the grind of a series is too much for them. It certainly seems that they have stopped caring. If you like to "parrot" characters verbatim, play drinking games by shouting out what's coming next in a scene, or find that you've been attracted to Saturday Night Live post 1979, you might like this. I was acutely disappointed 
 I was really excited about this book when I first heard about it. I'd read through River God a few times, and I was eagerly awaiting a follow up... And I wouldn't really consider The Seventh Scroll to be a follow up, but rather an Indiana Jones type story that holds some references to the characters in River god.   I already felt let down and confused after the first 20 pages of Warlock. Something innate and compelling that permeated the world of River God was completely gone. The writing seemed uncharacteristically dull and rushed.   Maybe it's something to do with the way the narrative was changed from the first person to the third. There was something intimate about the reader's relationship to Taita's thoughts in River God. The story alerted you to his flaws and arrogance by letting you listen to him brag and congratulate himself. In this novel, Taita is a bland and uninspired figure.   I find it difficult to even recall the plot of Warlock. The characters were all 2-Dimensional and devoid of personality. If it weren't for the token Wilbur Smith gore and sex, this book would almost play out like a children's version of River God.   In some ways this book disgraces the world that he created and brought to life with River God. It is impossible not to make the comparison, and while it is an easy book to go through, nothing in this one stuck for me. I was bored instead of fascinated.   I actually found that by the end of the book, I was trying to discount it and just forget about it, so that it would not taint my attatchment to River God. In every way that River God was epic and inspired, this novel is boring and predictable.   If it were possible to detatch it from the first book and enjoy it for what it is (a silly action adventure novel about ancient Egyapt), I might give it 3 stars... but it is absolutely impossible to do so, and in some ways I almost regret reading it. 
 The controls are very difficult and I understand they wanted "realism" but they killed a lot of fun by making you just so damned vulnerable to EVERYTHING.  I'm a long-time gamer and I can handle a tough game but this is just frustrating to the extreme.  Plus for all the people talking about immersion...I just don't see it.  I just couldn't get myself to care about the world or story I was in; it didn't grab me like some games do 
 ok, most people have more then one system, i have a PS2 which plays copies, and the 360, hmmmmmmmmmm should i pay so much money for the 360 version????????? or should i go for the free copy i can download for the PS2?  some people might say better graphics..hmmmmmmmmmm. dont care and many don 
 I've been reading all of the 'romantic comedies' in this series, and there are the good ones and the so-so ones, but this is so far the only one that I thought was awful. It's so predictable, and most of the things they say are corny. If you want a good one read She's Got the Beat, Ripped at the Seams, or How NOT to Spend Your Senior Yea 
 i'm very sorry i bought this book.  It may be concise, and it may be cheaper, but one shouldn't sacrifice spelling for saving a few dollars!  The concise edition drops the dots off many of the letters, thus either misspelling the word or creating letters that don't exist.  i borrowed the full-sized edition and found it to be fine.  Don't waste your money and your sanity on this version 
 "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"   When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live 
 Let me get myself straigh here first. I have always been a fan of the Artemis Fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins. I loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of "evil" foe. Also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.  Now let me rewiew this particular book. ITs a horrible read. who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts? no me. now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd, i mean seriously a "barbie" doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they're boys. How old is the author anyways? two years old? well obviously he's not married thats for sure. I always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds, not four year olds. Anyways enough of that, the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father. I read Colfer because he writes futuristic books, that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn't even solve robberies, instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war.  All of the wicked humor is lost, there is no action whatsoever, the main charecter isn't a genius with wicked humor, and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others. Heavily downgraded, adn obviously the worst parts. DO NOT EVEN READ THIS THING. get some other artemis fowl books, or read Alex Rider,. thats a very good read. 
 You can eat when your hungry and stop when you are satisfied and still not lose weight if you are eating mostly the wrong kinds of foods.  It was only when I started eating right(lots of fruits and vegetables and whole grains)that I started losing weight!!!  I also found that when I started eating the fruits and vegetables that I didn't crave the bad things (candy and chips)so much.  
 Maybe Mushroom head should worry less about their mask and image, and concentrate more on learning how to play a their instruments. I have never heard a metal band that was so horrid in my life. All Mushroom Head does is whine through every song with some easy power chords to go along with it. These guys are nothing that you havent heard a million times before, and they are just plain bad. How anyone can like this is beyond me, even if you love Nu Metal, there are so many bands from that genere that blow these guys out of the water. If you are aching for some good Nu Metal, then try Machinehead, Mudvayne, (older) Slipknot, or DevilDriver 
 This idiot believes he can write, but he is very good at using big words that makes him think he is intelligent, but he's not! He sounds stupid and he doesn't have a clue what he is talking about! Of course, none of his readers do either!!! He is obviously a fan of Johnny Depp's (aren't we all?), but that's the nicest thing I can say about Mr. Pomerance. Sorry 
 I think this is one of the "Richard Scarry" books, not a genuine Richard Scarry. The pictures don't look quite right and the writing is all wrong 
 It has tons of information; both fresh and processed foods, but I found it difficult to look at the pages.  The cheap, greyish, mass market paperback pages are fine for a novel and straight through reading, but when you're trying to follow a tiny chart it makes it hard to do.  After looking at all the food counting books in the bookstore, I finally found one compact book with medium stock, bright paper and great info that was easy on the eyes for just $2 more.  The Ultimate Calorie, Carb, & Fat Gram Counter by Lea Ann Holzmeister.  I recommend that one over the Netzer book 
 I order from Amazon frequently, and am consistently happy with the products and service.  However, I was very disappointed in this item--perhaps my own fault for failing to notice that no dimensions were given in the item description.  I wrongly assumed that the charm would be approximately the size of my thumbnail, and was surprised when it arrived and I could barely find it in the tiny blue velvet bag that contained it.  It is miniscule--1 cm long x 1/2 cm wide!  The enamel is applied unevenly, and though the charm is tiny, it is evident that the enamel is thicker in some places, and contains air bubbles in others.  It might be cute on a charm bracelet with a purse or shopping theme, but would not work as a pendant, as I had intended.  I'm sending it back for a refund 
 Until this date i did not receive this prooduct? What is happening? I alredy wrote to you about this problem an d i am waiting for  a solution              Regards                       Mario Assa 
 The word usage was good, not ab ad writer, but some facts were way out of truth, like how he describes kurt "and did so much damage to his head hat police could only identify his body through fingerprints. dental records were no use because nothing was left of his mouth" that is total bs. there was no exit wound, and hardly any blood. his head was clearly not "blown off" and there was hardly ANY damage to his head..  that upsetted me.. its an insult to kurt's memor 
 Huge mistake, I bought this book before reading any review about it. I thought the mistakes and issues people were talking about regarding the 1st version would have been fixed in this 2nd edition. Well, I guess this 2nd is as bad as the 1st one. Anyway, it's about all the aspects of e-commerce but really really really lacks any kind of depth. It's 100% superficial, pure common-sense and is honestly, indeed, a waste of money. I could have said there are quite a lot of useful links, but when you see they still refer to USweb/CKS, that became marchfirst maybe 2 years ago, and that actually went bust a few months ago... forget it! And one more critic: it sounds like Steffano and Juanita have some problem with their ego... really, forget this book.. 
 As many others have pointed out, this book is quite biased in it's handling of the cuisines of different countries.  Yes this book is quite Anglo-centric, but what would you expect?  There is also a clear dislike of all things American and the author would have you think that this countries sole contributions to the world of gastronomy are fast food joints and Coca Cola.    However, the reason I only gave it one star is the accuracy of the entries.  We have a right to expect that reference works from this publisher be painstakingly researched to present information without error.  But there are just too many factual errors to ignore.  Three examples serve to make my point.  In an entry about ice cream sundaes, he refers to one of the towns as Two Rivers, Michigan.  Two Rivers is in Wisconsin.  Next, in an entry for chuck wagon he refers to wranglers as the assistants to the cook.  Wranglers handled the movement of the herd and never, ever assisted the cook who almost always worked alone.  Third, in an article about the United States, he writes of the emergence of fast food chains including "White Tower" Huh?  I'll admit that sliders aren't for all palates, but the chain is White Castle.  There are just three that come to mind but I'm only up to the letter F.  Should obvious, easy to research mistakes such as these be tolerated?  For me, it brings the accuracy of the entire book into question.  I expected better from Oxford University Press 
 I bought the book thinking that I'd be getting detailed information about homeowners insurance but the author merely glosses over the subject matter.  I think he's an agent and, as such, doesn't have that much experience when it comes to the information I need, such as claims (particularly mold since I was just cancelled as a result of filing a mold claim), how to interpret specific policy language, etc 
 This book is horrible, plain and simple. It is repetitive, there is no  point to it, and it has almost nothing to do with baseball. Kinsella, a  genius that wrote SHOELESS JOE, let me and you down with this horrible  (should i even say) effort. If you read this book, you are wasting your  time. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it. Maybe Mr. Kinsella will refund  the cover price? I sure hope so 
 i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift. at first he was thrilled to get a new one. upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it, he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain, making it almost impossible (and very uncomfortable) to use. He had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way. He did, however, like the other features, namely the light and the pen. 
 This album sucks! I hate how Terry sings "Skip To My Lou" The way she sings it makes me cringe. I've heard it and therefore, it stinks! Nobody should buy this album, it's a piece of _______!   
 I received this as a gift because I am a huge JA fan. I read it through to the end because I read all books related to JA. I cannot believe this book has a rating of 3/5 stars. The plot, as continued by Barrett is absurd in the extreme, and, as others have pointed out, inconsistent and capricious. There is almost no dialogue, a distinct departure from Austen's usual style. A smarmy, confused, verbose narrator conveys most of the "story line." Adding insult to injury is the unnatural and awkward writing style. Barring a few grammatical constructions and vocabulary changes, Austen's language is not so different from our own. Barrett would have us believe that people, in truth, fly everywhere and use the conditional every other word. Would that eager JA readers could but be warned away from this unhappy collection of words 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 Don't look here for a horror movie my friends because you won't find it.  Oh, "House" starts off well enough and the old lady's suicide creates an ominous tone and just when you think it might be a scary movie, it turns into a joke.  What you essentially have in the movie "House" is a dark comedy bordering on just downright comedy.  There is pretty much ZERO horror in this flick and when the villain is actually revealed to the audience, you just have to laugh out loud because it is meant to be funny.  If you like dark humor with just a taste of horror then this is really right up your alley...if you want a pure horror movie that will produce genuine scares, forget it because you won't get it with this movie.  Incidentally and yet very sadly, this movie produced a pathetic sequel called "House II" that is just plain crass, stupid and mindless humor...it is so bad that I will not even write a review on that garbage 
 The book is really only useful for those interested in a literature survey, discussion of public policy, and somewhat tedious discussion of theoretical concepts 
 This is a nice book but it does not contain Provencal style interiors!  I am not sure how the author came up with that title since anyone who is interested in French country will not find it here.  If you are truly looking for Provencal decorating ideas-this is not the book for you.  CONFUSED!! 
 I was so disappointed. Too many characters, big print, no resolution, just...disappointing. Good thing she is on to another series, but this one deserved better. 
 This text is one of the worst in terms of technical merit and correctness.  The author obviously does not have much of an idea about statistics and how to implement SPC... 
 The guitars are ok but are too loud and drown out the vocals. The drums are even louder which drown out the base. Add to that the vocals are terrible anyway so I have no idea why others are into this CD. Also, the whole package just sounds muddy, the production apparently wasn't top quality. If you like a raw garage band sound with amateur talent then get this. If you enjoy professional quality music stay away. 
   I'm afraid I have to agree with the other previously happy Memorex users in noting that Memorex quality/success rate has gone downhill.  I was skeptical when I read the other reviews and I stuck with Memorex, but I have seen the light now. For a year I was very successful with the DVD+R Memorex disks.  In the 25 pack spindles I would buy, they would all work....so in Aug '04 I bought 2 25 packs at Circuit City (a mistake?).   That appears to have been a waste of money.  I just tried to burn a copy of something and I ended up trashing 4 disks in a row.  I was  convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else.  Then I remembered someone had given me a blank Sony DVD-R disk, so I thought what the heck, let me try that one.    Into the SONY drive it went and it copied without a hitch.   That was the final straw for my Memorex loyalty.  Out of a pack of 25, I have about 10 left, but have had to trash 6 of the 15 I used. Not a good success ratio.  Bye Memorex 
 I'm a big George Strait fan and was disappointed by this album.  This is not as upbeat as some of his other works, which would not be a problem if the slower pieces matched up well against classics like 'I Can Still Make Cheyenne.'  Sadly, they don't.  Moreover, even some of the upbeat works on this CD were not up to the high standards that Strait has set for himself.  The end result is a CD with a couple of good songs and a lot of chaff.  This CD starts off strongly enough, with a piece called 'If The Whole World Was a Honky Tonk;' this is upbeat and well written (Strait did not write any of the pieces on this album).  However, the album then starts swinging wildly between some outstanding pieces such as 'Texas,' Strait's cover of Merle Haggard's 'The Seashores of Old Mexico' and the hit 'She Let Herself Go' and some substandard pieces such as 'Oh, What a Perfect Day,' the upbeat but uninspired 'High Tone Woman' and the disappointing title track.   By far the worst piece on this CD is 'Good News, Bad News,' a duet between Strait and Lee Ann Womack.  This is a long piece that has clearly been designed to show off Womack's vocal range.  The song feels like it's missing a verse and like Strait really is just along for the ride.    This is a CD that I would only recommend for die-hard Strait fans.  There is not enough solid material for the casual fan or for a true twang aficionado to bother purchasing this instead of waiting for the best pieces to show up on a later Greatest Hits compilation 
 There is a reason there are 247 used ones of this book.  We used this book in for our men's study group and every one of the men, and every one of the wives agreed, that this was a worthless book.  It was written for a 1950's wife that no longer exists.  Now 3 truly wonderful books to help you with your wife are:  Discovering the Mind of a Woman by Ken Nair  If Only He Knew by Gary Smalley  Together Forever: How to Overcome Problems and Rekindle the Love in Your Marriage by Anne Kristin Carroll   They are truly inspirational as to how to be a good husband

 I stopped reading the Kay Scarpetta series after the first three books, and after reading this, the worst so far, I remember why: because I don't like any of the main characters. Which is a shame, because the author is skilled, the plot lines are really good, and the forensic medical detail is fascinating. Unfortunately this latest effort quickly degenerates into a weepy, whiny pity party for Kay Scarpetta, with everyone explaining everyone else's inadquacies by forcing their own patronizing pop-psychology 'insights' down other's throats. Way too much of the book is taken up with this nonsense, and the dialog becomes totally unbelievable. A hasty last-minute grafting of an international plot twist late in the book does nothing to mitigate the soap-opera quality and irritating personalities of all the people in it.  Lucy, who started in the Scarpetta series as a brat who needed a serious spanking, has developed into such an angry neurotic that it's beyond comprehension that she passed the FBI / ATF psych tests during the hiring process. Of course, Lucy is now a stereotyped lesbian as well. Lucy's subplot in this book is a clumsy and needless complication that serves only to fill a lot of boring pages and never goes anywhere beyond the requisite awful-parent issues.  Marino has also degenerated from an annoying but harmless redneck to a truly wacko jerk. How someone so ignorant, narrow-minded, and incompetent could make it to the ranks of detective is also beyond comprehension. In Black Notice, Marino has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and Scarpetta herself keeps telling him to be quiet and go away. Obviously she doesn't think too highly of him either, so why does she waster her time with this clown? The promising subplot with Marino's new supervisor quickly goes from being his problem to yet another poor-Dr-Kay, being betrayed by her own people issue(yawn) - the sudden resolution of which is a total cop-out, excuse the pun.  And then there's Scarpetta herself, who used to be interesting in the beginning of the series, but changed into a self-pitying, sanctimonious rich witch who is more concerned with her status toys (BMW, expensive house, antique furniture), and safeguarding her official power than with doing her job, except as a boost to her overinflated ego. This is not a character your average pay-check stretching, just-getting-by reader could identify with. And it took her far too long to figure out the 'long, soft baby hair'clue - she is supposed to be a hotshot medical examiner, after all. If she spent less time trying to get back at people out to ruin her, and more on working her actual cases, she'd get these insights sooner. Of course, in a story with so many tangled, unnecessary and ultimately unresolved subplots, it's hard to imagine anyone getting anything done at all.   It's a shame that this book was such a dog. I have great respect for this author's writing ability, which kept me turning the pages even when I wanted to throw the book across the room. I just hope that her future efforts focus more on plot - her great skill - and ease up on the annoyance factor of her increasingly strident characters. Surely they have some redeeming qualities. It's far past time to let them shine through 
 Heres a natural cure to get rid of a hemmorhoid:  Don't buy Mr. Trudeau's bull#$*! books.  He will eventually go away.  
 This is a book that surfaces again and again in popular culture. Last year I saw high school students in the show "Freaks and Geeks" discuss it in their English class. In the Australian indie film "He Died with a Felafel in His Hand," the protagonist aspires to be a new Kerouac, repeating over and over how Kerouac wrote the whole book on a roll of butcher paper to avoid the artificial structure imposed by separate sheets of paper.  So I read the book; actually, I listened to the audiobook narrated by Alexander Adams (published by Books on Tape). Kerouac has some excellent turns of phrase: he loves laughter, as the protagonist (Sal) encounters a man with "a long quivering crazy laugh," one whose "tremendous laugh roared over the California woods," one whose "laugh was maniacal," and yet another whose "laugh...was positively and finally the one greatest laugh in all this world." And Kerouac tells some great stories.  But the book was frustratingly uneven. Sometimes the stories are really interesting, and other times they drag on and on, with exhaustingly unchecked hedonism and lack of purpose. Note that the book is also pretty gritty, with lots of alcohol and drug use, and several depressing sexual encounters. A friend asked me to compare the book with Steinbeck's Travels with Charlie: no comparison; there is a reason Steinbeck won a Nobel Prize. But the other fundamental difference is that Steinbeck traveled with purpose (to get back in touch with America), while Sal travels with no purpose but to "go, go, go. 
 LeAnn Rimes music is NOT country. She has never been country and never will be country. Her music is just crappy generic pop fluff. If you whant REAL country music try listening to Patsy Cline or Hank Williams 
 Epstein consistently fails to distinguish between the law as applied by real courts and the law as Epstein would like it to be. On the rare occassion that he does acknowledge that his views are not law, he refuses to present the arguments in favor of the majority rule fairly or objectively, often characterizing a court's allegedly faulty application of a rule as a mistake, or worse. The vast majority of Epstein's views in any area of law, including the law of torts, are way out on the fringe of American jurisprudence, and he does the reader a disservice by pretending otherwise 
 This did nothing for my lashes, which are blonde, but long, so it doesn't take all that much.  It somehow made them look skimpy and clumpy too.  I discovered Diorshow after this and it's phenominal!   But if you want a very good mascara and don't want to spend the money, I recommend Max Factor 2000 calorie.  
 While the book contains very interesting material regarding the roots of western outlaws in the years after the Civil War, some individual facts leave a bit to be desired.  All in all a good read, but I would encourage further reading on some subjects, or at least double-checking some of the facts used in the book 
 This is a great idea, very useful to protect your keyboard. I think that computer companies should always integrate this kind of protection to the keyboard. Keyboard aren't cheap, and on laptops if you spill your coffee, your laptop is pretty much dead. So this comes in as an important piece of protection.   Unfortunately in low light environment, especially when there's still enough light for the backlight of the keyboard to be off, you just can't see the keys anymore. Because of this issue, 1/2 of the time i'm not using the protection. The protection is very sticky on the side that goes against the keyboard, meaning that when you don't use it, it gathers a lot of dust very quickly, beating the purpose of having that "skin" on top of your keyboard.  Another good idea, that really needs more thinking, as to what material should be used so that it's fully transparent 
 I am halfway through the subject book (Gerald Green's "East and West"). I have found several historical discrepancies and I'm wondering how many there are that I don't know about.  1. Mr. Green refered  to Camp Pendleton, twice in the timeframe of 1941. The US governement did  not buy the land for Camp Pendleton until March of 1942. 2. He refers to  Japan's Imperial Marines. Japan did not have marines. They had a Special  Naval Landing force often called marines by US troops, but that is not what  they were. 3. He refers to a Japanese major's rank insignia as  "leaves". This one I'll have to look up, but I don't believe  Japan used the same type of rank insignia as the US. Has anyone else  complained about authors blowing it like this ? I think it casts doubt on  the credibility of his work. Can you comment as well ? Thank You, Lee Ras 
 Bought this one for Evolution class. It is a horrible excuse for a textbook. Do not buy this book unless it is for a middle school student. If the authors think this book has been written for an advanced audience, then I would suggest that anyone interested in learning evolution not attend University of Washington 
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 	Linda Lawrence Hunt must have had a time machine.  She chronicles Helga and Clara Estby's 1896 walk from Washington State to New York City in her 336 page book Bold Spirit.  She did so, even though all were unavailable to her.  Helga Estby, a Norwegian immigrant, keep many detailed journals during and after her journey, but her family burned them out of spite and shame.  Helga Estby walked across America to receive $10,000.  She planned to use it to pay off the debts she and her husband Ole and their ten children had accumulated.  Or so says Linda Lawrence Hunt.   	Bold Spirit is ten percent fact and ninety percent speculation.  Gleaning from only a few newspaper articles, public records, and a few interviews, Hunt manages to produce a considerably long piece of what she calls non-fiction.  For all we know, Estby planned to use the money to open up an opium den.  Just because the Estby's were struggling financially and Helga was offered $10,000 doesn't mean she planned to use the money to pay off debts.  Sometimes people do things that don't make sense.   	Hunt's "primary sources" are questionable.  Biased and inaccurate press is as much of an American tradition as hot dogs and beer, and it was especially rampant in Victorian America, as literacy rates and newspaper production rates were increasing but rules about unbiased media hadn't been established.  While periodicals help supplement a biographical account, they should not be the foundation of it.  Because time makes memories fade, interviews of family and friends are just as inaccurate. 	Hunt assumes the political views of Estby and her daughter.  She assumes that Helga was a feminist.  Had Helga been as strong of a woman as Hunt portrays, perhaps she would have written a book about her walk, like she had planned.  Perhaps she wouldn't have taken her nineteen-year-old daughter with her on the 3,500-mile walk.  Perhaps she would have opened up a school or started speaking to the community about her walk.  Estby becomes incredibly apathetic after the walk; perhaps she was depressed because of the death of two of her children while she was away.  Perhaps because she and Ole were never able to fix their relationship after she was away for so long.  Perhaps it was because she was raped or hurt on the trip.  No one knows, not even Linda Lawrence Hunt.  This kind of speculative "non-fiction" should not become a precedent in the historical world. 	This book would have been enjoyable if it were historical fiction.  Hunt could have used her imagination as much as she wanted to do pretty much what she did in Bold Spirit: fill in the gaps left by the documents.  She could have spruced up the story and added plot twists.  Her writing style is insultingly simplistic. 	I would recommend this book to a fifth grader.  The writing style is easy enough to understand.  The plot is basic.  On the surface, it is an encouraging tale about a bold, courageous woman.  But anyone interested in historical integrity, an interesting story, or reading anything past a fourth grade reading level should probably stay far far away from Bold Spirit 
 I usually love James Newton Howards scores but this one seems to have something seriously missing. His previous work for M Night Shyamalan (Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) was fabulous but Signs seems like it was the wrong genre for him, or something.The whole thing just seems to be music effects with no real theme or emotion. At best this score sounds like a second rate Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Like the film itself, a real disappointment 
 Although I believe this book helps enlighten one to the reality that our soul and deepest longings as women are interconnected with the Creator and His passionate love for us...MUCH of it's "theology" is flawed.  I felt an appeal to self exaltation and a humanizing of God that is clearly anti-biblical.  I would guide any of my fellow Christian readers to remember that all false doctrine is effective because it is dressed up in truth....but it's heart message is false and usually self exhorting.  
 I bought this (luckily, used) based on the excellent reader reviews I read here on Amazon.  I could not have been more misled.  This is one of the worst self-improvement books I have ever read. It is bad beyond anything I could have expected, so bad that had I not gotten my hopes up for a good read with some good advice, I probably would have fallen out of my recliner laughing.  This book is a very thin gruel of other writers' ideas, dumbed down for the sort of reader who finds literary satisfaction in  romance novels. The substance of this book is nothing more than "If you write down what you want--and keep writing it down, if necessary--you'll get it."  Hmmm.    "Hmmm" is right.    Hardly anyone these days isn't familiar with the earlier New Age incarnation of this idea--writing affirmations--and anyone who has read the writings of the Founding Fathers of motivational self-improvement (like Napoleon Hill) has seen it as well.  Far, far too much of this book consists of anecdotes.  The anecdotes range in their effect from soporific to nauseating.  Take "Gloria's" story, for example.  An entire chapter is devoted to Gloria's search for love, for a husband.  She writes letters to a "soul mate" that she has not yet met.  Among her puerile love-maunderings, she writes a description of the soul mate she hopes to meet:  He is a "beautiful" dresser, and has "Strong hands, deep integrity, and spiritual truth," and a gift for "making and having money." She doesn't want the money because she's high maintenance and loves to spend; no, she wants the money "for the joy, love, peace, and bounty it can bring the world."  (Uh, yeah, sure Gloria.  Clearly you're one of those unfortuate individuals who believes her own bs.)  After two years of writing this sort of pabulum to herself, Gloria goes to a bar, gets picked up by a lawyer, and marries him 11 months later. As we all know, lawyers typically possess exactly the sorts of qualities she was looking for in a soul mate, so this outcome is hardly surprising....  The book doesn't get any better than this, and there is even a short chapter at the end of the book to help you rationalize the failure of the techniques (for lack of a better word) described between the interminable anecdotes.    Most importantly, the advice simply doesn't work.  This book really is a silly piece of nonsense.  Skip it. 
 good movie, bad copy!  I ordered it because it was cheap.  However, picture quality is POOR; fuzzy, washed-out, blurry.  It looks like it's recorded in superlongplay.  The shortness of the tape would seem to confirm this 
 Gay Talese's work on his family's journey from Italy to America is an involved tale that delves into a difficult historical period for both the United States and Italy.  Revolution, social upheaval, racism, and war  color Talese's story from start to finish.  These themes give the tale a  characteristically depressing bent which tends to ramble in certain places.   In addition, there is a decided social message which the author appears to  be trying to put forth during the entire story.  These perspectives, and  those on Italian history, should be viewed in the context of  interpretations of an Italian American writer and not be taken as those of  traditional native Italian scholars.  Still, the book is in a bold attempt  at telling the story of one family's struggle, on both sides of the  Atlantic, during the social upheaval of the twentieth century 
 I GIVE THE DVD A 1 STAR NOT THE MOVIE. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT A NEW DISC SET COMING OUT. Finally this morning, Disney has delayed the DVD release of the Crimson Tide: Unrated & Extended Edition from 3/14 to 5/16. No word as to why 
 I have not read any of Charlie Smith's other work, so I can't compare this to previous efforts. His writing is poetic, and truly impressive in short bursts. But over the long haul, the poetry interferes with the prose. Words  and phrases seem to be chosen more for their sounds and rhythms than for  their contributions to plot, and dialogue can be stilted. Imagery is vivid  but occasionally self-indulgent. The storyline is interesting at first but  eventually grows gaudy and distasteful. The power of Smith's language is  his greatest strength, but it is a strength better suited to poetry than  novels 
 Having seen Dead Man Walking, I became interested in seeing more movies about the death penalty so I got a hold of this movie.... I hated it.  The acting was corny and cheesy.  Sean Penn's performance as a condemned  prisoner facing imminent execution was vastly superior and definitely more  convincing than Sharon Stone's.  It beats me why this movie was released  shortly after Dead Man Walking.  In fact, it beats me why it was released  at all.  Stick to Dead Man....don't bother with this extremely lame ripoff 
 I liked this cute little tag when I got it, though I can't speak to its reflectiveness as I never let my puppy out in the street at night. However, in little over a month my puppy managed to chew it beyond recognition. The letters are no longer readable and I'm going to have to order a new tag. This time I'll go for a metal one 
 I did realize that these shoes squeaked, but I didn't anticipate how loudly that squeak would be! I doubt my girls could hear anything over the sound their shoes were making- I know I couldn't 
 In terms of both format and style, "Rent" - despite its superficially modernist tendencies - has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition.  Yet, it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters.  In more traditional musicals, the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings.  This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like "Phantom of the Opera," which seems a natural for this type of approach, but with material like "Rent," which is small in scale and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience.  I know that this play (and, perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers "Rent" practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming cold to the work, "Rent" adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.  The story, a modern day update of "La Boheme" set in Greenwich Village, starts on Christmas Eve, 1989, and ends on Christmas Eve, 1990.  This was at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and, indeed, many of the film's characters - primarily gay men and former junkies - are struggling with the disease (AIDS being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story).  There's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists (one is tempted to call them "deadbeats") from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block.  "Rent" - with its noble "performance artists" doing battle against the Big Bad Corporate Bullies - feels less like a relic from the `80's than one from the `60's.  Though intended to be the heroes of the piece, the artists and bohemians often come across as naï¿½ve, painfully self-absorbed, and annoyingly self-righteous, an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local ATM machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend's name (the heavily allegorical "Angel") as the password (this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man).  Anything`s better than actually working, I suppose, and becoming a tool of corporate America.  When one of the men finally takes a dreaded "job" ( a mere sinecure, I might add) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes (horrors!), he acts as if he is selling his soul to Satan, and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest-to-God paycheck.  I wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them.   With the exception of newcomer Rosario Dawson, the filmmakers have retained most of the original Broadway cast members for the movie, and even though their acting isn't all that impressive, some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing.   In his direction, Chris Columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production, but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we're watching.  Despite the constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has chosen to employ, the film still feels stagy, over-stylized and artificial in almost every scene.    As to the libretto by the late Jonathon Larsen, only one tune strikes me as truly memorable, while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling.  One of the problems, too, with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian, pedestrian and prosaic - when they aren't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of "the opposite of war isn't peace; it's creation" - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music.  It's not for nothing that the Sharks and the Jets didn't actually sing out most of their confrontations.    There are, admittedly, some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters, but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings I have ever seen in a motion picture.  In that one crucial moment, the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce, taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it.   I don`t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for "Rent" (or of its many devoted followers), but it`s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people - especially "sensitive" artists - should be allowed to live on other people`s properties for free 
 Don't buy this, I bought it and it died within 12-18 months just like the factory Ni-Cad.  Buy the new Ni-MH replacement HHR-P402 it has now lasted me 2 years at least.  I didn't have the Ni-MH option when I bought this so I guess I can't fault them for selling it but now the Ni-MH option is here so don't buy this 
 All this air pump does is let out what little air may be in your tyres.  I can't think of anything else I have ever bought that was as completely useless as this. It is a toy, pretending to be an air pump.  The nonfunctional lever on the top (mentioned by other reviewers) indicates that it was designed as a toy.  I'm just happy I was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway, not out on a trail.  In the past, I have bought a number of Bell products, including motorcycle helmets.  I now shudder to think what might have happened if I had put one of them to the test 
 Be warned - this book is over 600 pages long and every character is a talking cadaver.  Yes, there are seven narrators, but, as many critics have noted, their voices meld into one - this lack of differentiation undermines the basic intent of the novel. Instead of being in the company of seven different characters, I felt I was in the company of a single person, the author - and he wasn't feeling that great.  The book reads as a dreary confession, one that would have any self-respecting psychiatrist reaching for his prescription pad.   * There is far less ambiguity here than you might imagine, and in more ways than one.  A change in perspective never overturns any basic fact about the plot or, more surprisingly, regarding a character's motivations - rather than being akin to Rashomon, where each view radically conflicts with its neighbour, here the narrators simply take turns telling the same undisputed story.  This lack of conflict between their vantages leads to a lack of tension; and in itself deprives the voices of individuality.  Yes, one character can see things which another can't, but it's more a case of adding to the overall picture, instead of actually angrily erasing and painting over the space.   * The rhythm of the sentences varies little from chapter to chapter.  This is not Faulkner.  The vocabulary is similarly uniform (as an example, "perfunctory" and "insensate" are used by Angela, while for Joe it's "obfuscate" - these being the two allegedly less educated characters).  The characters all achieve a similar level of insight into, and reflection upon, themselves. Perhaps most disappointing is the chapter voiced by Simon, the literary minded precipitant of events.  For all his alleged passion for poetry, his writing is bland and his references to literature rather limited - his voice does not breathe life into the bones of his character.  The dialogue is poorly written - in most chapters it would be difficult to tell who is speaking without prompts, and the overall tone is awkward and dead; perhaps the Dennis Mitchell chapter escapes this criticism. * The two prime female characters are drawn as stereotypically beautiful.  We are carefully informed about the size of their breasts, and the allure of their eyes.  In intellectual matters, they respectfully defer to their male superiors, be this the soulful stuff of art, or the technicalities of card-counting in blackjack.  Yawn.  There's not much evident irony in Perlman's choice of such representations.  When Anna reveals that: "He played me like a musical instrument", I had to check the cover to make I sure I wasn't reading Judith Krantz.  If parts of the book read with the flattened affect of an airport novel it could be because his characters, and his handling of them, share many qualities.  Then there's is the central issue of Simon's obsession with Anna - the narcissism inherent in this is impressive, but its exploration is limited - it might be raising the standard too high, but Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' shows how multi-faceted such an exploration can be. * Perhaps, more than reading the book itself, it's interesting to ask why so many people found it so stimulating.  The very flatness of the style does make it easy to read.  The attempt to begin a meditation on character by invoking childhood influences, adult relationships, and unpredictable events, is, as everyone says, ambitious.  It could be that the analysis proceeds at a depth which is comfortable for most readers - it allows fractions of honesty to become visible, while a veil remains over much.  Of course, fractions can add up to a sizeable sum.  My overall reaction to the book was negative, and reminded me of the mood created by reading books by Richard Powers - both authors construct plots which shape a superficial interest, and pen characters with surface complexities, but the crucial insight required for true empathy to be established is missing, as is a winning sense of humour.  At best this is a novel I might admire, but not one that I could love 
 I picked up this book because I was considering a road trip and was looking for inspiration: the 15 yrs and 90 000 miles part of the title led me to believe the author would have a lot to share. Instead I found myself wading through details too personal to empathise with (why should I care that Multnomah Falls is special to you because you once met a woman in an New York elevator wearing a Multnomah Falls belt?), underwritten by endless references to Lewis & Clark (if I'm as interested in them as you assume, wouldn't The Journals of Lewis & Clark be a better purchase?).  Yes, driving for miles on road trips can be dull, but there's an art to reflecting that in an interesting way that engages the reader. Like the reviewer above notes, it's as boring as watching someone else's home movies, and indeed as annoying as a road trip that gets off at every exit 
 Christmas morning, my daughter tears the paper off this toy and is soooo exited. What a disapointment. Nothing I did caused the tail to wag, the leg to move and no licking action. I changed the batteries, still nothing. After hours of trying to get it to work, I went on line here and read somebody elses review about rubbing under the collar VERY HARD. Finally, the tail wagged, the foot moved and then, it actually licked. What a piece of work, very cute but WAY too much work. In time, I will eventually rub all the fur off under the collar. Save your money 
 Compared to most other Zep books available this one is extremely lacking in details. Information given about quite a few of the songs in this book can be attained by simply listening to the song lyrics. Some of Led Zeppelin's songs have been very well documented through the years, and that info is included in this book. But if your looking for the meaning behind more obscure song (ones that everyone and their dog already know the meaning behind) don't look here. If your a Zepp fanatic "The Stories Behind The Songs" is a waste of time and money. If your just starting to get into Zeppelin, and know practicaly nothing about the band this book has basic info that you can use 
 This five-finger man gives this film 1 finger (guess which finger). Brando gives a performance unworthy of his oscar status, & Kilmer is either too stoned or too bored to even finish his lines. Not even Fairuza Balk's beauty or Stan Winston's exceptional effects could save this hairball of a flick. Someone call the vet 'cause this film deserves to be neutered. Bad doggy; the litter box is full; and yes the lion sleeps tonight - 'cause this movie put him into a coma.  
 This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though. 
 I found the writing of this book quite bad. While reading the book I felt like suggesting that the author find a good editor to clean up the uneven, choppy, and repetitious writing here. She uses the word "nowadays" all too often, I even found it in a passage which is attributed to a person who wrote into her column in The Atlantic Monthly. I could get out one of my old writing books and give specific examples of the areas that are in need of a tune up, but I do not wish to put that much time into this review, nor do I think that this is what this forum is meant for. And I do not relish giving a bad review, the author seems to be well intentioned and probably a good and productive person, but this is more the reason I felt the need to add my two cents.  I came here to Amazon's review forum to find out if anyone else felt the same way I did, and was amazed that so many well educated readers found the book so good. This is quite disturbing. I now doubt that well educated readers are able to discern between good and bad writing. It also makes me wonder if the reviews are from friends, many of them sounded so similar. The ideas are refreshing, but presentation could use one or two more rounds with a good, or perhaps different, editor 
 I bought this book and returned it after I saw that it had nothing to teach the more learned users of Premiere. I was really dissapointed when I saw that it couldn't tell me how to sync a fast-paced video with multiple scenes, just the usual scrubbing technique 
 This book is totally dissapointing. The authors have no knowledge of aviation business. All the book is just ass-leaking of SWA. They should have done more research just to understand how airline business work.  The book repeats and repeats the same. It is just honoring of SWA. SWA has no flaws, SWA is the best etc. And there is no explanation why it is best. It is just abstract explnations from textbooks on Leadearship etc. There is no logyc connection between the statements they make and the results they come to in this book.  If you have too much money and time to waste, and you are a masohistic type of person who likes to be dissapointed by some stupid mediocre unprofessional writing by people who do not know anything the thing they write about - this book for you. Otherwise - just forget about the book called "Nuts!" by Freibergs and look for another good source of information about SWA 
 True or not, I can't help feeling that ANGELA'S ASHES has destroyed a generation of Irish/American writers (or any writer wanting to write in the field).  Not to say that CARRY ME DOWN is ANGELA'S ASHES all over again, but I can feel its ghosts tucked between Hyland's spare, plain, beautiful, yet graphic writing style.    Haunting is a word that will pop up time and again as you read the book, and it is a haunted book to be sure. The last time I actually got this involved with a character and their moods and feelings was with Will Perry in Phillip Pullman's A SUBTLE KNIFE, so, why the low score when all it seems I have nothing but praise and teaspoons of surgar for this novel... well, there are some problems.  As good as the prose is, it still comes across like a play with all the stage directions wedged into the story trying to pass itself off as legitimate fiction - it's not.  Everything is stark, sharp and literal.  Cup. Table. Chair. Fireplace - you name it, it all reads flat on the page and never sticks in your mind.  Some of the ideas do.  The subplot about being a human lie detector, the struggling and desperate end to a marriage and the breaking of the family unit, it's all done very well.  But then there are the triggers and emotional landmines that cheapen the deal.  The fate of the kittens being the most grevious, and sore thumbed.  It's a brutal scene, and pulls at your heart - not because it's so well written, but because it's murder most foul, plain and simple.  I could ring tears out of that scene in any novel, no matter the subject, so when I read it here it really felt like a scene Hyland had floating around in a journal that got transplated into this novel.  And while the dialogue was well written, and often sharp, it tends to sound flat inside your head.  Almost like you've walked into the 1,000 performance of a play, and the actors hearts are tired of the material - it's colorless, humourless and dry... but still compelling in its decay.  It's a tough novel, one that I wanted to love every time I turned the page, but by the last page I simply could not love it as a novel, but could find some heart for the process and art of it trying to be a novel.  CARRY ME DOWN comes across like a work in progress, much like its lead character, and as he develops we hope the novel will as well, but it never does.    It ends without ending, much like life itself 
 While the mitt is beautiful and the price is right, it is narrow.  Most mitts flare towards the opening, this one does not.  I have larger forearms and it won't fit all the way up.  My husband has average sized arms and it won't go around his upper forearm either.  Since they are so long they go almost to your elbow 
 Quite simply, all the adult characters in this book are downright mean.  What's with the dark gloomy tone of this book for children??  No thanks.  On lessons of life and love, I'll take "The Giving Tree" any day. 
 This obviously is a re-release of the OLD "Empire Strikes Back" kit released in the 80's.  A decent size kit (approx 15 inches) it gives an experience modeler a good opportunity at super detailing.  The kit is relatively easy to build out of the box, but it has many inaccuracies most notably the inaccurate sensor/bridge deflector DOME on top of the ship.  These inaccuracies can be addressed by looking in the Internet for replacement parts and articles on addressing those inaccuracies.  However, the kit is worth the price.  My only disappointment is the kit is not in scale with the new "Republic Star Destroyer" from "Revenge of the Sith".  The new kit for the new movie is over 19 inches long.  In order for this kit to be in scale with the current movie version, it would need to be about 24 inches long.    Hopefully someone will make the "Imperial Star Destroyer" to that scale. 
 Please do yourself a favor and read the book rather than listen to this audio version.  The narrator, who speaks with a modern West-coast accent, is the absolute wrong choice for this funny, charming story set in the early 1900's.  Peck's humor is nearly lost in this monotone reading 
   once again, chomsky shows he is one of the most brilliant men alive! It's all America's fault! - the evils of capitalism! long live socialism! yet the man is able to publish the same book every six months and charge $14.95 for it BRILLIANT! from marxist to capitalist in one easy printing!  
 Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.    This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror 
 ¿Por qué se le ocurrió a Tim Burton hacer un remake de este clásico? El resultado no puede ser peor... Sólo fui a verla porque sale Tim. Que vestido de primate resultes igual de atractivo y apasionado que siempre es lo único que vale la pena de toda la historia.  Tus ojos siguen emitiendo fuego. ¡Qué no se apague nunca! You Are The Best! 
 Thull has taken Sandler's system, added some bits of "New Strategic Selling" from Heiman, and called it his own.  Please don't get fooled, even if he did persuade some notable business authors.  I've also been to his seminars, and have needed a sales process for a complex sale, and he added no value.  I learned nothing new.  I tried to use his style of "diagnostic" line of questioning, and customers saw right through it, and it even confused sales calls.  Went back to my own hybrid system, and started closing deals again.  Save your money and time, and use the originals 
 Rhine reviews experiments on 'paranormal' phenomena, mostly done in his lab at Duke. Unfortunately his overly positive approach does not present an accurate view of the field. Telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychokinesis; to hear Rhine's account you'd think these were all proven. If a tested phenomenon has been reported positively twice, Rhine considers it verified, no matter how many negative studies have been done, no matter allegations of experimental weakness, data manipulation and subject and experimenter fraud.  Not one of the phenomena Rhine discusses can be routinely verified under adequately controlled conditions to this day. If people could see hidden objects and influence events such as the roll of a die, Las Vegas would have been bankrupted long ago.  Since Rhine's discussion of paranormal phenomena are so flawed, the later chapters on social, scientific and religious implications are worthless.  If you are looking for Rhine's "Galileo wannabe" moment, it's on page 156 of the William Sloane version of the book 
 I do not who to contact on this problem but I have as of yet to recieve a magazine yet. I kow it is to take awhile but i have recieved other order of a  different magazine I placed 
 I thought the narrator was terrible. She is under the impression that people in upstate New York have southern accents.  Or maybe she never figured out where the story takes place. It must be the mint juleps that confused her. You'd think there would be an editor or coach that would notice this discrepancy, but I guess if nobody could be bothered to edit the author's work, they certainly couldn't worry about the narrator's accents 
 Sorry folks, this book is not all it appears to be. I considered it a beginners book after looking through it.  Nice effort on the writers part but "WHERES THE BEEF???? 
 How can the vendor justify this kind of pricing? It must be all shipping. Do yourself a favor. Go out of your house and hunt for hot sauces. While it would be too simple to say "they're all the same", there's definitely not a lot of difference within the same manufacturer. I'd get this for a gift for someone, but for myself I'd rather enjoy the hunt. 
 Thanx For MUSIC Of James Otto. The Best Part Of The Flic. Watch It People James Is A RISSING STAR. James Otto Has 1 CD Out. "Days Of Our Lives" And It Is Worth Having In Your Stack 
 Okay, this is the Beethoven set everyone is talking about. And I am a big Karajan fan. Then why such a poor rating? In short, this cycle is entirely missing some important sides of Beethoven symphonies. First of all, these performances are way too string-dominated. The woodwinds and brass of Berlin Phil, no matter how refined they sound, are restrained in the back seat. The result is a complete loss of humor and characterfullness that attract me to Beethoven's music. Karajan's smooth approach has no bite or edge although I have to admit it has a plenty of drive. It's a feeling of driving a BMW on a well-paved road. But Beethoven's music, at least to me, needs to be a bumpy ride with some wild turns. Sure, the playing is glorious, lush, and as large scaled as it can be. The 9th benefits greatly from this larger-than-life sound (I think it's a breathtaking performance). Lyrical passages are so refined they almost sound like parts of Tchaikovsky's ballet music! But I do not think one should think of this as a set doing justice to Beethoven's music, which is very multi-faceted. Conductors like Harnoncourt, Zinmann, Hogwood, Abbado, Walter, Kleiber, and most noticeably, Bernstein wonderfully proved that in their own way. I believe Karajan is a hundred times better conductor when he is on Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, Ravel, Debussy, Bruckner, or Mahler, all of which he handles admirably. 
 Meditation will do the same thing. Buy a tape or take a class 
 Wes Roberts and Glen Marshall have written a book that takes the leap of faith, but unfortunately it misses.  There is no doubt that these two authors genuinely desire authenticity within the Church and in its leaders.  They write with an almost prophetic style calling the Church to reflect on its heritage and to consider where it is going and they desire some wholesale changes within the Church.  While I agree with the authors that authenticity and character is needed I reject the idea that the Church is institutionalized and therefore crippled or spiritually bankrupt.  Furthermore, it is not enough to simply point out what is wrong and what needs to change if you do not supply some practical wisdom on how to create change.   In the end this is a book that offers a lot of finger pointing and assigning of blame without offering any real hope for a stronger more effective Church. 
 I have purchased and returned two sets of these headphones. The first set overheated and fried itself as soon as the batteries were installed. The second set worked for a little over an hour before developing constant hissing and popping. Also the head band adjuster would not retract on one side, making it impossible to fold them up for storage in the travel bag.  I consider the quality of this headset one of the poorest I have ever seen. Even frayed bare wires were visible on one side.   I recommend you avoid Taurus products completely 
 My mother always loved Danielle Steel and she collected as many of her books as she could find throughout her life.  She died several years ago and I still have a lot of her stuff.  I really like to read and I came across the box of her Danielle Steel books.  I've read a few books out of the box over the past few months and Passion's Promise was the latest.  I was very disappointed.  I really enjoyed the other books I've read so far but I didn't like this one very much.  I don't think Danielle Steel spent much time brainstorming and planning the book.  She spends a good length introducing Kezia.  Then she spends another good length of time talking about Kezia and her love affair with Luke.  Then you're almost done with the book and the end is shoved into like 20 pages.  I was not satisfied with the ending.  It seemed like she spent all this time setting up the rhythm of the book and then suddenly stopping it at the end 
 If your IQ is less than your age, you might actually like this book. I was forced to read this as an assignment for a college course, and I lost all respect for anyone stupid enough to be swayed by such a weak argument. Shiva uses only fear and hyperbole to convince the reader that corporate America is out to destroy everything, much like all the other pieces we read in that course. I beg of you, don't submit yourself to this ... (can I say that?), for if you are really stupid, you might be persueded by it. This is the stuff that people who support acts like the Word Trade Center attack read for inspiration. Just ask my professor 
 This movie was so low brow and low budget it was sad to watch. It was more of a movie about Asia's secret passions, take the first scene in the trailer, getting taken from behind by the black guy...gimme a break. The only thing and I mean the ONLY thing worth watching in this train wreck was the young woman toward the end with the HUGE breasts! I mean my mouth dropped at how sexy that woman was. For the rest of the film...I spit on the time I wasted fast forwarding to the nudity. Oops, I mean to the good parts. LUV MOMS 
 I'm going to start this off by saying that I am NOT the biggest Andrew Lloyd Webber fan.  Some of his works are amazing, like Joseph and various songs from each of his musicals, yet overall he tries to incorporate a very fake sounding pop opera into most of his shows.  Unfortunately, The Woman in White, his first try at gothic opera, is even worse. Webber obviously tried to pretend that the score for the musical was quality, thought-provoking work by jam-packing it with dissonant chords and loud orchestrations, but they only show how little he truly knows about music.  Half of the show's score is little short of random notes that seem to have no connection (almost as if he tried to imitate the genius of Sondheim).  The tunes are bland, the book is boring and confusing, and many of the performances are sub-par.  For instance, the actrees portraying the Woman in White simply shrieks throughout the entire CD.  Even when she sings, her screaming din hurts one's ears.  It seems as if she decided to cover the underdevelopment of her character with noise.  The other actors are generally adequite, yet they have so little to work with that their portrayals seem dull. Admittedly, there are some highlights to this CD, such as Crawford's amazing portrayal of Count Fosco (especially the live version of You Can Get Away With Anything...it is HILARIOUS!), but overall, the CD is hard to take in.  Some songs are quite beautiful, yet the track on which they resign are also full of shrieking, dull dialogue, and loud music.  I think it is a tell-tale sign of a flop when on a live-version CD of a musical, only one song is accompanied by reaction from the audience 
 When I started charging my K750i, it didnt charge at all no matter what. This is a load of s***. dont buy i 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 Hey, I like have a complete set of films in my collection for each franchise.  So, this is part of the Pink Panther legacy and although Arkin tries, he's no Peter Sellers and the plot is so weak that it collapses at the end and the movie finishes so fast you'll think that that ran out of time.  
 This was one of the worst books I've ever read. I did make it through to the end it took about a week 
 it definitely lacks expressive quality, particularly on the classical pieces.  Her dynamics are appropriate and fine, but it's a very one dimensional sound.  Her long notes have a beautiful tone, but they don't move anywhere.  They just hang in the air waiting to meet their ends.  Listen to Cecilia Bartoli's rendition of Sposa son disprezzata to hear what this piece sounds like when it really is brought to life.  I'd love to hear Summer's tone with Cecilia's passion... 
 After reading all the rave reviews, we put Pupsqueak on our Baby's registry, but were very disappointed when we received one as a gift and he didn't work. We tried exchanging him for another one at Babies R Us, but we couldn't find one that worked. So instead we exchanged him for the Dinosaur (I forget his name). Our daughter loves him. Since he's soft we are not afriad with placing him in her car seat with her. She loves falling asleep holding onto Mr. Dyno 
 ITS 2007! I AM GOING TO YELL HERE BECAUSE I AM JUST SICK AND TIRED OR THIS SIMPLE OVER SITE OVER AND OVER ON SO MANY DVDS I SAW THIS ON CABLE, IT *** WAS **** CLOSED CAPTIONED, AND IT IS A FUNNY SHOW!   SO I LOOK IT UP ALL OVER ONLINE, NO CLOSED CAPTIONING/ENGLISH SUBTITLES ON INCLUDED IN THE DVD I HAVE DVD'S FROM ( 10 ) TEN T E N YEARS AGO THAT ARE SUBTITLED CAPABLE I HAVE CASH, READY TO BUY, SO DO MILLIONS OF OTHER HEARING IMPAIRED PEOPLE, HAVE CASH, READY TO BUY, BUT CANT.   PEOPLE WITH HEARING PROBLEMS SEEM TO BE THE LAST GROUP LEFT IN THE USA THAT STILL GET THE SHAFT. HERE WE ARE, THE 21ST CENTURY.    Ridiculous 
 I skimmed John Gray's "Practical Miracles for Mars & Venus," but couldn't stomach the hype.  The first 150 pages are about the power of positive thinking and of belief in miracles.  (Gray claims that the world has matured to the point that miracles are now available to anyone, at any time.  Democracy and religious tolerance are two of the enabling changes.)  Gray then sketches some simple techniques for physical and emotional healing: eat right; breath deeply; use a Chi Gong exercise to "recharge healing energy" and "decharge excess or negative energy" (or stress and negative thoughts); imagine that people have treated you better than they actually did; write yourself a letter expressing your frustrations; cultivate gratitude, confidence, joy, etc.; envision the world you want; believe in yourself and your power to heal.  I gather that the techniques are more completely described in Gray's "How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have."  "Practical Miracles" reads like an ad for Gray's seminars, or like a verbatim trancript of a stage presentation.  (On page 239 he says "Now I have written twelve bestsellers and tend to be a speed writer. ... After many years of developing my thoughts, it takes me only a few months to write them down and create a book.")  Positive thinking is all well and good, but the seminar must be more inspiring than the book 
 This lifelong Cardinals fan managed to get through the book, but it's hard to imagine any non Cardinals fan who is not a speed reader doing the same. Though I am not an obsessive baseball fan (haven't seen a game even on TV for nearly 20 years), the in-game stategies Bissinger details are nothing surprising; in context, anyone, experienced or not, would seem likely to come up with them. Readers will learning virtually nothing here. To give Bissinger a break, it seems he agreed and perhaps signed a contract to write this book without realizing there would not be anything to say. Bissinger does not deserve a break for his criticisms of Lewis' "Moneyball," however. (The hardback edition of "3 Nights," perhaps, is not so strongly positioned against that far better book, but the paperback I read contains an afterword devoted entirely to trashing Lewis' book without (a) any understanding of it, (b) apparently, a rereading of it, and (c) any evidence whatsoever to butress Bissinger's "ya gotta have heart" position. Likewise, Bissinger deserves no break for the horribly bad, lazy prose here. Examples: Pujols is referred to in his first 20 or so mentions as "the great Pujols." No variations (not even "the really great") of the phrase are used. Page 275: a player plays "each and every game at five hundred percent." Page 254: a World Series victory is marked by a "Rubik's Cube of a hug." Page 243 (and elsewhere): "sultry hot," as if "sultry" does not imply "hot." Page 224: "white hair as finely woven as pasta." This is the kind of writing folks compose deliberately to win bad writing contests. Disappointingly, the paperback edition, at least, doesn't even have any pictures. Stay away from this one 
 9 of 9 people found the following review helpful: EVERLIFE IS LITTLELIGHT, November 22, 2005 Reviewer:	AGNAZZO (Tampa, Florida United States) - See all my reviews LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIFE FLASHLIGHTS. THE PARTY THAT SAID THAT THESE FLASHLIGHTS ARE CHARGED UP DURING SHIPPING IS SUFFERING FROM SHAKING OF THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A MINUTE OF SHAKING AFTER DELIVERY BEFORE THE FLASHLIGHT IS GIVING OUT ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH IS VERY LOW. AFTER THAT TO KEEP IT OPERATING MORE SHAKING IS IN ORDER. THE ILLUMINATION WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER BATTERY FLASHIGHTS DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND NEED ADDITIONAL SHAKING TO KEEP IT GOING. THIS FLASHLIHGT TO BE FAIR MAY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE. LED FLASHLIGHTS THAT USE BATTERIES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THESE SHAKING FLASHLIGHTS.THE BATTERIES LAST A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE LOW POWER THAT LEDS OPERATE AT 
 I don't believe it.  I'm sorry.  Any perceived reduction in pain can be caused by the placebo affect.  I highly doubt that someone who had bowed legs, all of a sudden had straight legs in five minutes.  The author is vague and the chapters lack documentation (Once, there was this lady who came to me...).  The author claims to be able to change the molecular structure of water by "running energy" into it.  Sorry, I might be closed minded, but there is no way.  The whole "quantum physics" thing is just a scientific explanation that, conveniently, no one can disprove, and the author uses this to his advantage to sell books, dvds, training sessions, etc.. 
 This is simply a catalog of plans you can buy.  I wouldn't pay for a Sears catalog of things to buy.  It also has a list of related articles in Woodenboat magazine that can be ordered.   I am looking for imformation on how to build a boat, not looking to buy a book on where to buy imformation on how to build a boat 
 Bill Maher personifies the reason why I, a life-long democrat and a teacher, am moving away from the current "Democratic" party and leaning more toward independent.  I am sure he has wonderful ideas but couching them in a constant barrage of foul language and hate-filled rantings makes me realize that the party has left me, I haven't left the party.  JFK would, today, be considered a right-wing wacko using the Maher standards.  I was so excited to get this book, hoping to hear (I had the CD) wit and humor with far thinking ideas.  Instead it was the same nonsense spouted by the likes of Michael Moore and Cynthia McKinney. Sad really. I disagree with most of what Ann Coulter says, but at least she's intelligently funny.  
 I am so unhappy about buying this book.  I went on to check out Mr Young only to find some very interesting issues this man has had along with some of his co workers. I find it to be all about the Money , not that everyone isnt interested in money.  However there are much better books by pros that are serious and do not try to scare you into buying their oils.    Sorry,  once again  very upset about spending the amount of money on this book. 
   I am not sure what the filmmakers of this train wreck were striving for when they made this low budget movie. I think the film is nothing more than an excuse to film young male actors nude. The film wants to be something it is not--it wants to be a mystery film when in reality it is a no-class softcore porn flick. To call this movie cinema is an insult to filmmakers and to viewers fooled into watching it!   Needless to say I think this film has few, if any, redeeming features. Where to begin? The plot is weak asking us to believe in characters doing things that no one with one ounce of logic would do (for example, the mother leaves home for a few days to visit an aunt knowing her husband recently slugged her son in the face without provocation).    I did not believe for one single moment any of the situations that were happening. The acting? Hmmm. Okay, I'll give the two young male leads some credit here. They made the best of a bad situation. In fact, most of the the young actors were passable (just passable), however, the adults are another story entirely. I would venture the entire movie's dialogue, especially the well-intentioned actress playing "Devon's" mother, was looped. The voices don't sound right. The acting ability of the actor portraying the step-father was about as subtle as the smell of a fertilizer plant... i.e., he reeked!    This movie has cardboard characters possessing no real sense of believability. For those who claim this movie is camp is doing that genre a disservice. I read a few reviews that complained that the young male actors weren't hot enough-- what a ridiculous notion! Those comments miss the point of this film entirely. This was not supposed to be a story about hot men, but about teen exploitation. In effect, what this story tries to warn the viewer against is exactly what the film becomes. The actors were used and used badly by this film's production team.   I lay the blame entirely at the feet of the producer, the writer and director. This amatuer drivel is the worst kind of schlock available to buyers. I could go on and on about how bad this movie truly is. As a writer I can say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Save your money. There are pleny of other gay-themeed films that are worthy of your money and your time. It is not often a film makes me so angry. Stay away from this one! 
 I can't beleive how utterly desgusted i was. this story was awful. The plot of course is nice like always because it Pirates of th Carribean but the book is so easy to read and not written very well.    I'de just stick to the movie.  Nothing against the Pirates of the Carribean in general. It was the perfect thing to read if you missed the movie and was just catching up to find out what's going on but the book just deffinitly wasnt worth it at all otherwise 
 the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that I didn't even try it on.  it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that didn't go with the main color of the suit.  Very poor choice for a grab bag.  Taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 I have been programming for nearly 20 years.  Starting from Pascal and FORTRAN to C++ to Java and C#.  Needless to say I have to keep reading new books and material to keep up with innovations in software development.  Unfortunately, I have found Windows 2.0 to be perhaps the most useless book I have ever read in the area of software development.  Good books are either 'primers' to introduce new users to a language or 'tutorials' to show certain tool, like an IDE, or a language or a book is a 'reference' where practitioners can turn to for advanced topics and hop around as needed instead of going through from start to finish.  This book is a lousy fit for any of these catagories.  It comes closest to a reference but an incomplete one.  For example, have a look at MaskedTextBox control in chapter 3.  It gives a simple definition of what it is and its benefits (you can get the same and more on the web for free) but fails to mention mask tokens that are used for automatic input validation in MaskedTextBox.  From nearly a 1000 page monstor one expects explanation of such basic features.    I found that any topic/chapter I have read has failed to enhance my understanding or knowledge at a theoretical or practical level.  
 Don't waste your money on this book. Save it for your equipment. A better choice for a beginner's book is Nightwatch by Terence Dickinson, available from Amazon.com. You should also subscribe to Sky & Telescope magazine and order a free catalog from Orion Telescopes and Binoculars Co. Their Web site URL is telescopes.co 
 I found the author's writing style difficult to read, and the content questionable.  While I do not know much about the subject, the book seemed somewhat "occultish" and I question the author's expertise and background on the subject. I do not recommend this book 
 This movie has been terribly hyped-up, for reasons unbeknownst to me, perhaps politically, I presume, in the usual Hollywood fashion.  It has got to be one of the most slow-moving, boring, uninteresting movies I have had the pain of having to waste my time on ~ while attempting to sit through it.  However, the one and only good thing about it is that Ralph Fiennes is in it ~ but that is all.  Don't waste your money and time on this dud, as I'm sorry I did 
 I dont think the other reviewers are quite accurate in their assessment of this text.  The book does offer many examples, and the pseudocode is very helpful in implementing these methods.  The real problem with this book is that many of the explanations of the methods are written in pseudocode.  This makes learning the concepts extremely confusing and difficult, as they are written in code.  The proofs are helpful, but with the confusing notation in iterative methods, there is no way near enough information to correctly learn what is going on.  I took this class in graduate school and never used the book unless I wanted to see some code.  My advice: Take notes from the professor, and if you need to code up a method, go to the library and copy down what you need.  A VERY poor teaching aid 
 Schaeffer has a few valid points that could be developed into strong arguments to support his thesis, yet he fails to organize his thoughts and he does not substantiate his claims with concrete examples. This book needs strong editing and perhaps the ranting could be turned down a few notches as well 
 I've read many books in this segment and I would strongly recommend reading Hot Text: Web Writing that Works or Networds. Robert Bly is a "print guy" that thought it would be interesting to write a book on electronic copy.  I would say that the first half of the book is written by supposed experts in on-line marketing.  The book is crowded with all sorts of references to other people's work. This leads to a very choppy style of reading in my opinion.  The author uses case studies from work that he has already completed but rarely does the content match the electronic world.  For a book that is written in 2003, the data is incredibly dated. The author is comfortable with using data from 1996 in a book that talks about the ever changing environment of On-Line marketing.  Most of the data regarding internet statistics was incredibly dated. The author talks  about the principals of good copy writing but rarely goes into any depth with regards to examples of the principals.  I found the writing to be lazy to say the least.  Clearly this author is capitalizing on the interest of electronic copy.  Take out the experts that know about on-line marketing, you're left with an incredibly weak book.  Although there are is a lot of expert reference, rarely do the experts go into any depth with regards to their arguments or points.  If  this book is the only book that you are exposed to within this segment; you might be left thinking that you read an average book. When you compare the book to other books in the same segment, it simply doesn't compare.  Not a good book 
   The line up of 60's and 70's soulsters is interesting - an eclectic mixture of the well known and the not so famous. The backing orchestration and vocals are excellent. However, everything unravels when the lead vocals commence. The singers all sound as if there was a curtain between them and the microphone when the recordings were made.   It is not just a matter of 60 year old vocal chords being weaker than 20 year old. It is not the obvious lack of proper balance between the audience noise and the music.  The simple problem is that the vocals were not mixed at the correct volume. I can understand such a problem with a 1960 concert. This is a 2003 production!  I am perplexed 
 I have read a number of Steele's books over the years; this one was so bland, trite, and contained such bad writing I had to look at the cover repeatedly to establish it really was her book.  Sentence structure, content and story line all fall far below standards - did she have an editor at all who would tell her the truth?? The first person, third person, omnicient points of view vary from sentence to sentence; one minute you are in Peter's head, the next standing above the room commenting on what is happening.  I think the sentence that blew me apart was on page 106 (hardcover) where she states "He had an envelope full of money in his pocket with a hundred thousand dollars in it."  Well, we didn't think it was yen.  I don't know if I'll read any further, its taken all my patience to get this far..... 
 Ive read reviews for this piece of schlock calling it a "  cult classic" ( isnt that  what they always call crappy movies that only stoned college kids can watch? )  or "underated" (theres a reason  it was underated -IT SUCKS). Brad Pitts performance was laughable. Watch any episode of Gunsmoke and tell me Early Grace wasnt a bad impersonation of Festus from start to finish. And that guy from the X Files ,David sumthin or other, mumbles in this annoying monotone throughout the whole film. This guy adds about as much to the movie as those ads for the concession stand.And Juliet Lewis playing a  yet another brain dead bimbo. Who woulda saw THAT one coming??? The only reason I gave this one 2 stars is its so bad it just kept me on the edge of my seat. I think its called " morbid fascination", like when you stop to gawk at a really bad traffic accident - it repulses you but you just cant turn away. If you want my advice ( and you probably dont) take the money you were gonna spend on this movie and go buy a Gunsmoke DVD. That way you get Festus AND you get to watch Matt Dillon beat the h*** outta somebody 
 Ok let's be honest, this was [bad].  It was not powerful, or anything else one of the other critics exclaimed Sinch to be. It was pure and whole-heartedly [bad].  I guess if you like depressing dribble from a band that has enough money to not really care about the things they write then this is for you.  Maybe I'm just an old fasioned punk but aren't lyrics supposed mean something other than "my life sux sooooo bad" 
 I think they once called this approach  "Variations on a Theme"? At the time of this writing there are 47 (other) reviews here of this CD. (Who needs another!!!) Most everyone claims to likes it. Numerous reviewers make references to other groups - Mogwai and G.Y.B.E -  who mine this same post-rock soft/loud groove. I purchased this CD based on those comparisons. However - 'Explosions in the Sky' seem to have only one idea, and on this CD, at least, they simply provide us with several variations of that one idea. Not that this is a bad thing. This technique has been used (and is still used) in 'respectable' music for centuries. Classical, folk and jazz all employ this method of fleshing out a skeletal musical idea with different embellishments and various voices. Personally, I tired of Explosions after just a few listenings. I think a mathmatician (of logician) could write this music as a simple formula. "Employing fifths, section A must always lead to B; section B must always refer back to A; this should be repeated thrice, sotto voce; followed by a sudden, bursting crescendo of equivalent duration; reprise section one; Fade to end. Instructions for next track: see previous - play in alternate key."  This is not necessarily a bad thing... Perhaps this is a sort of post rock 'Ambient music' to be listened to from another room or used as background texture while other activities take place. However, there is no adventure in this music. These musicians take no risks and they do not challenge us. They simply stake out a small piece of musical turf and then they strike poses on it and pace back and forth, caged by a formula too simple, but not knowing how to move beyond it. This CD is amusing the first few times it spins, but there is not enough here to merit more than one star. Sorry.. 
 I tried to read this book(translated) to the portuguese, about 15 years ago.Even never finishing it, I as a brazilian (unemployed) agronomist must tell the reality about weberianism. At first, Max Weber was a man looking to show the reality.He wasn't a bigot(or mad) such as Loraine Boettner, Eric Jon Phelps, etc. With no doubt, Max Weber was a great scholar, a man with great IQ, a man man looking for reality.Even with this qualities, Max weber was wrong.Even a man like Max Weber, like you and me, is ever a prisioner of his times, informations and reality. The core idea of this book is that capitalism, industrial revolution and modern science were made by protestantism. Very believed idea in Weber's times. In fact, Weber puts "the cart ahead of the horse", in this idea.In fact, modern world wasn't created after Luther.It was shaped in XV Century, with the press and Great Navigations. The press was invented by a catholic german, called Johann Gutemberg.All the great navigators were catholic men.Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Bartolomeu Dias,Cabral, Gil Eanes,etc. 100% of then were catholics and were under catholic kings money and orders.With the Great discoveries the American continent was under Europe's hands.The claim that protestantism was the source of Europe's power was and is a fraud. In fact economically and lively, after Luther, protestant Germany became a nightmare until the end of 30 years War, in 1648.The claim that protestantism was good for Europe is a possibility, not a fact. In fact, we could see protestantism is a result of nacionalism, church's abuses, education and greed for church's money. Not all protestants countries of Europe had good economical results.Germany was doomed after Luther's Reformations.Not all catholic countries had bad economic results, as France shows.Spain and Portugal were bad, after jew's expeling, not after any reformation. With the Industrial Revolution, coal became condition "sine qua non" for economical sucess.And the Geology(not theology)decided the future for nations in Europe.With no coal Portugal, Spain, Italy were senteced to relatively poverty, in Europe.France with bad coal reserves, has some dificults in industrialization.Belgium, even more than 90% of his population in catholic church, had no economical problems, because Belgium had great coal's mines. Why England had so good economic results, ahead of every other european country?Beeing an island, England shouldn't have an expensive army against invasions.Then, England could built the biggest navy in the world.Geography, not theology gave economic sucess to England in XVI and XVII Century.With the Industrial Revolution, England had coal reserves looking to be minerated. Geography and later geology gave England industrial and economical sucess.With the 30 years War, Germany was splited in about 300 feufdoms. The England's decadency also came from no theological problemas, but geological, political and tecnological problems.With the reunification of Germany, an industrial enemy was created in continental Europe.With the invention of airplane, England could be attacked by an enemy with no navy.With the coming of oil's age, England (North Sea oil's reserves not found before the 1960's) had to import100% of his fuel.With both World wars, England's empire was sentenced to death. Protestantism in fact, like today, was ever divided in thounsands of cults, since his beginnings.If fact all kinds of protestantisms are image and similarity of his human creator, culture and society.Luther made a anti-semithic protestantism suc as himself.Calvin made a bank's friend protestantism, as himself was.And the England's king Henry VIII made an english protestantism.All reformator made a Jesus equal to himself.This fact is true until today.Protestantism don't make a society and culture.In fact a society and a culture makes a protestantism. The brazilian and latin american reality shows that protestantism itself don't make economical sucess.Here in Brazil, 80% of people who go to a church, go to a protestant (pentecostal) church.Do we have economical sucess with all this protestantism? NO!!!! This same fact happened in many parts of latin America.Bad economic results followed protestantism growing.El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua all are as protestants(pentecostals) as Brazil.All with bad economical results. About 35% of brazilian population are protestants, against about 80% of brazilian maids are protestants.In fact the brazilian protestants are, poorer than the general brazilian population.Also brazilian states with more protestants have bigger crime rates.In fact, more protestants, more crimes in Brazil.The poorest of all religious groups in Brazil are, the protestants(pentecostal).Only protestantism as a medicine for economical, political and cultural troubles is a quackery. Not a single african or latin american country had good economical results after protestantism's growing.At the same time, Spain with less than 1% of his population protestant, is an economical sucess.Italy and Portugal with only about 2% of protestants are also developed countries.  This book is a source with some good things to read.As I wrote up, Max Weber was an honest scholar, not a mad or a bigot.After all, Max Weber was looking to show us the reality, but he only wrote us rooted, in his own times, believes and realities.Every man is a prisioner of his times, friends and realities.And Max Weber wasn't an exception.          
 I can't believe the audacity of Brad Steiger. It takes a lot of nerve, or very little honor, to publish a tome of obviously fake photos and ho-hum ghost stories that were admittedly lifted off various Internet sites.   Steiger has little respect for his sources: He rewrites their testimony into his own words, so that every single story and anecdote sounds the same. Not only that, but several phrases are used over and over--I lost count of how many times he spells out his wife's entire name instead of merely referring to her as "my wife" or "Sherry."   It's also frustrating reading about some spectacular photo his wife took, or that was given to him, that shows clearly some spectral phenomenon or UFO--and the photo isn't anywhere in the book. The photos that do appear are of the tired and debunked ilk of orbs, double-exposure photos, even one photo of a paper cutout head GLUED to someone's shoulder!   The only thing scary about this book is that it's supernaturally LAME 
 I have news for Deedra, it is just as humiliating, infuriating, and degrading for a father as it is for a mother. If women spent more time meeting the short and long term needs of their children they wouldn't be so wounded. Mother's start out on top with the legal system and usually end up on top. Deedra and the other women are heard by the legal system even when they whisper. It doesn't need to be a fight if everyone is concentrating on our children. Children need a mother and a father even if those people live in different homes. 
 I am a big fan of Woody Allen and I presume that I will eventually get around to seeing all of his movies.  Prior to viewing "What's New Pussycat?", I would have presumed that I would enjoy each and every movie.  However, "What's New Pussycat?" has shown me that even Woody Allen can make a disaster movie.  What is wrong with this movie is just about everything.  The acting can only do so much with an impossibly awful script and a director who seems to want to magnify the faults rather than cover them up.  We start with a man whose problem is that he must seduce every acttractive woman he sees.  Peter O'Toole won the rights to play this character and he is surrounded by beautiful women.  He proceeds to make it all seem so boringly ridiculous.  He calls all his femine friends "pussycat" which gets old after a while.  He constantly displays a bewildered expression coupled with a rather interested/disinterested approach toward his playmates.  He seeks the help of a sexually challenged psychiatrist played by Peter Sellers.  Sellers does his best with what little he has to work with.  He has the Dr. Strangelove accent down pretty good and he is constantly on the make but the humor that emerges is so weak as to be embarassing at times.  Woody Allen wrote the script, which is the most shocking disappointment of the whole picture.  I once heard a comedian remark that a good comic writer can give you 10 new jokes of which you can use 3.  With Woody Allen, the comedian said, you can use all 10.  In "What's New Pussycat?", I wish there HAD been at least three good jokes.  This overlong look into the problems that O'Toole's character suffers from eventually attempts to save itself with a sort of Bennie Hill-style slapstick.  I take that back; there's no justifiable reason to besmirch the good name of Bennie Hill by associating it with this turkey.  Anyway, the movie ends in a chateau with a sort of musical beds involving all of O'Toole's mistresses.  An incomprehensible brouhaha ensues and the revelers escape to a neighboring go-kart track.  (Presumeably all fashional French Chateaus have a conveniently adjacent go-kart track).  This enables the movie to sink so low that it boggles the mind.  After all, we have some top talent in Allen, Sellers and O'toole and we see them spontaneously go go-kart-riding off into the sunset (or the side of a building, or a mud puddle, or something meant to be funny).  I was glad to be done with the movie.  Woody Allen is a great talent.  Peter Sellers was a great talent.  Peter O'Toole was a great talent.  Watch them in their other productions but spare yourself the one movie that each one of them should not have made 
 Like most skeptics, Kammann and Marks pretend objectivity, when their real mission is to debunk every aspect of the field of parapsychology. For instance, they have zero belief on any level in the possibility of such things as telepathy and remote viewing. For them, it is not possible, so they set out to simply prove this assumption. Yet, simple physics allows for the possibility of some form of thought transference. Just as energy in the form of thoughts transfers from one part of the brain to another part via the neurotransmitters, why wouldn't it be possible for the corresponding molecular frequency to be picked up by another brain? The evidence for telepathy between twins or during dreams is overwhelming, but they ignore it all. See, for instance, Dream Telepathy by Ulmann, Krippner and Vaughan. So, in their attempts to pretend objectivity, Marks and Kammann really set out with the key goal of trying to debunk Uri Geller. They use as their proof  photographs that are so blurred that it is impossible to see what the photographs are of, yet these, they assert "prove" that Geller is a fake. It is shameful. Try reading Charles Panati's The Geller Papers if you want the truth about how Mr. Geller did in physics laboratories across the globe.  The problem with these types of skeptics is that they live in the mutual admiration society world without realizing that they are not true skeptics but rather narrow thinkers who wall off any chance of discovering anything of value by chanting Groucho Marx' famous credo: "What ever it is, I'm against it! 
 The book is good, but at times it drags.  There are points where I would have preferred more information and points where you just want here to get on with it.  So far the whole mess with the Eika seems pointless, except to give them someone other than themselves to fight with.  She gives just enought hints and clues to interest most people, but the true fantasy reader will find her frustrating to some degree.  I would recommend the book, but I would be sure to warn people that it isn't the best work I have seen 
 I love the concept and simple (implied) ease of use of this item, but when I actually used it, it didn't work so well. Some days it worked fine but then other times it would  turn on too early or too late (not at dusk as designed) or not at all 
  ...and probably for die-hard Floyd fans only. The live album features extended, more intense versions of studio songs, and captures what was basically the Floyd's live set before Dark Side of the Moon. It's both an interesting historical record of that time in rock (with the emphasis on extended jams and atmospherics) and you can also see in the live disc, much more so than the studio disc, the influence that the Floyd have to this day. Speaking of which, the studio disc is basically a pile of hippie arse, the only redeeming track being Waters' "Grantchester Meadows", a soft acoustic song that perfectly conjures up the hazy 3-d impression of being out in nature.   If you read the band member's comments on this album now, they are pretty scathing. Gilmour says he 'bs'd his way through the narrow way', and Waters (I think) has said that with this and the next album they were basically floundering around in the dark. As we all know, the results of that floundering paid off handsomely, and this is an interesting signpost in the Floyd's development, but doesn't really have much merit on it's own 
 I never quit reading books. I could see how this story would be confusing and hard to understand. I was able to keep up with the reading and understand it, but it was just plain boring. This book I just wasn't into. I didn't look foward to reading it. So I didn't finish it. Morrison jumped around to much.. once I started getting familiar with characters, she would switch it up. I don't know how it ever ended, but I wasn't patient with the book to find out 
 A very well written disappointment.  I read to the last page, eager to see the storylines resolved, only to be abandoned by our writer, our tour guide; who seemed to jump ship on us.  I was interested in the characters, so the author succeeded in that.  But that's only half the journey.  I can only guess that the characters are symbolic of extremes within ourselves, from oblivious, to bitter to codependent.  The lesson might be that each extreme brings its own brand of sorrow, with a study of these extremes in character form.  Or maybe not.  But it takes the disappointment out of reaching the last page without resolution.  I love Tyler's work and admire her skill.  But if I'm going to read half a story, I'd like to pay half the price.  
 The thing I hate about this magazine is the letters to the editor section. Supposedly, they're written by real people. But after reading this magazine for the last few years, these letters all seem to have the same maudlin, soporific, sappy style of prose that reads to me like they've been EDITED that way. There's this condescending "athletes are supposed to behave like GOOD ladies and gentlemen and if they don't, then tsk tsk - WHAT WILL THE CHILDREN THINK?" mentality that I absolutely HATE. The good things about SI are the photography and whatever articles on the NBA they have any given week. And the swimsuit issue? I guess if you're a 13-14 year old it's exciting as all get out - I'll take the HARD STUFF any day over their annual fleshfest 
 "Listen, Bunuel. What are we going to do? The witch has quit. Says: too much nudity. Who does she think she is - Mother Theresa?"  "I am a little busy, JP (Quiet, babe! Can't you see? I am talking to my producer here!). Just get another broad for the role: anybody, only with a good front."  "But, Maestro! We'd have to re-shoot half of the movie. Fernando is already talking of another engagement. In any event, with his rate if we use him again, it will be twenty years before we see any money from this flick. We might as well scrap the whole thing."  "Don't worry, JP. We'll keep shooting as if nothing happened. That's what being Great Director all about. They are morons, or why you think anyone would pay cash to see such garbage. Most won't even notice that the face is different, and those who do, will find a good explanation for it. Subliminal, surreal, existential, women are alike - all that nonsense, you know. Relax and have a drink." 
 I just had to read and write a review about this book based on my niece's meeting with Sean. But first, the review.  In order not to diminish the previous reviews, I will just focus on the whole war talk. On page 4--no messing around here--Sean states, "[w]e must take the war to them, rooting them out of their swamps and destroying the despotic regimes that furnish their lifeblood." Wow, bring it on dude. Oh, you mean let's send somebody else's kid to fight, right? On page 247 he drills that point in with, "[i]'d like to see the good governor [Dean] present a case that there's any higher moral cause than defending one's innocent countrymen against terrorist attack." If it's such a great "moral cause," Sean, why oh why ain't you out there with the rest of my family? Does this, by the way, mean you are immoral since you punked out? I never thought of myself as "moral" just because I volunteered and served as a paratrooper in Vietnam. Is military service only for Democrats and brown people? Should we have a new draft catagory such as "1R" for "Republican," which means you don't have to serve?  To paraphrase Frank Purdue, it takes a tender man to spout tough talk. Page 108 puts down Democrats (I'm a Democrat who served in Vietnam, or am I repeating myself?) with, "[w]hen it comes to the Hitlers, the Brezhnevs, the Saddams, pussyfooting is the order of the day." Yeah, Sean, tell me what you really think. Well, Sean, some of us are out there strapping it on every day while you...do....what? And wasn't the Bush family in business with Hitler during WWII?  Here is really why this guy is full of himself. My niece, visiting me before heading to the Gulf and her first combat tour, spotted him in DC. She introduced herself and told him she was a fan. When she told him she was in the military he offered her a free book, saying he would ship it to her. She is very polite, and told him he didn't have to. Sean insisted. She wrote her address down. Before heading overseas, I asked her if Sean had sent the book as promised. No (and no surprise for me). So, me being me, I contacted Sean by email twice but got not reply. Too busy impressing all those other servicewomen, I guess.  Sean Hannity, not just by this book but by his actions, is a coward, blowhard, and more interested in putting the make on cute servicewomen. His book dedication to his wife means about as much as the rest of the book. You should be ashamed of yourself, Sean, but that would mean taking a "moral" position, wouldn't it?  
 Considering the size of the book I was disappointed in the lack of information and meanings given. They are mostly one word meanings, if there is a meaning at all. Mostly it seems like it wants to take you in a big circle of reference from one name to the next never quite giving you what you are looking for. It wasn't helpful for me. I found "The Babyname Wizard" book A LOT more informative and helpful 
 American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good.  But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her 
 This novel fails.    Though Millhauser's details, details, details often succeed in drawing readers into his unusual, albeit believable, fictional worlds, this go-round however is a near-complete D-U-D.  What a disappointment!  It's a classic show-don't-tell disaster.  He tells and tells and tells--and ultimately drives the reader away.  I started reading this book with enthusiasm... I very much enjoyed Millhauser's stories in "Little Kingdoms".  And "Martin Dressler" started well, and it won the Pulitzer (so it has to be good right?), and there was tons of build-up (no pun on the story-line)... and build-up... and build-up... and fizzle.  By the end of the novel, you feel somewhat violated by superfluous adjectives and the list-quality of his paragraphs.  The relationships are similarly flat.  The whole novel is like a frustrating case of impotence.  I am grateful to Millhauser for helping me to imagine an industrial-era New York City, but otherwise, the plot is lame and the "climax" lamer still.  The Grand Cosmo which Dressler finally builds turns out to be so fantastical and utterly unbelievable--not in a good way--that it reminded me of the worst film of all time: "National Treasure" with Nicholas Cage.  Oh well.      
 This CD is the worst "comedy" CD I have ever heard.  Yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious????  Ok, I've come to the conclusion, the only people writing positive reviews on Amazon MUST be the people trying to sell the junk.  I've seen this guy on some tv shows, and on comedy central, and he's a somewhat funny guy, but it is painful to listen to this CD.  You can feel the awkwardness of the crowd, not knowing if or when to laugh.  And it continues throughout the entire CD.  There don't seem to be any jokes on the CD at all.  It is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being.  Don't believe me?  Then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk, and see for yourself.  Like my review title says, Do NOT read the positive reviews.  Just read the negative ones, and decide how credible they seem.  Then make your decision to buy or not buy 
 This is a kids book. First few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book. 
 I must agree with the first review. Although this book is well-researched, it suffers from a complete lack of understanding. Foucault's entire philosophy is junked in this attempt to apotheosize yet another French thinker...  And if the author abstains from excessive jargon, I say it is  because he cannot understand and effectively use that jargon; he is beneath  the contemporary intellectual current 
 The editorial reviewer is a used car salesman....This book is an outdated...a better title would be Wireless 2002 
 On our beloved Kay Scarpetta and the illustrious Ms. Cornwell?  Having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, I simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff? Very slow in the beginning, I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I endured to finish Blowfly.  However, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...Richmond, Virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  So Scarpetta---with Marino tagging along of course---heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of Dr. Joel Marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  The demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also unnerving to Scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. So why has he asked her to come? Meanwhile, Lucy, as head of The Last Precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  For such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must Cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  In this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee. Worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans throughout.  Drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell references a dead young man's "conspicuously large organ."  Are you kidding me?  The trash collectors are "big dark men" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the "old black woman" must WORK in one of the houses.  The author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as Lucy.  Read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.   DY 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 This book is terrible.  The lists are disappointingly incomplete and inconsequential.  For example:  A list on tipping includes tips for restroom attendants, but it omits tips for valet parking.  In my life, I have used valet parking significantly more often than a restroom attendant.  A list of common foreign phrases omits pronunciations.  How useful is that?  Knowing the spelling of a phrase does one no good during conversation should the pronunciation of a phrase be very different from its spelling.  Basically, if one had been raised by kindly wolves in the forest, and recently dropped into modern society, this book might be marginally useful.  But anyone with a modicum of planning or forethought would have outgrown this trite little waste of words and paper by age 10 
 I use Plone a lot in my job and I bought both this book and The Definitive Guide to Plone by Andy Mc Kay.  I find this book to be confusing at best, maybe because it tries to cover too much ground. When it describes the portlets, it goes on for SIX pages describing each portlet, with a screen capture for each portlet! It talks about REST for over a page, although this architecture has really nothing to do with Plone. Etc. Etc.  All in all, it seems to me that too many technical editors have worked on this book, making it overly technical and complicated. Even the font they use make the content look cluttered! It is very difficult to write something clear and simple, especially for a very piece of technical software such as Plone. In my humble opinion, this book has failed in that regard.  I almost never use this book on my everyday job. Get Andy Mc Kay's book, you'll get a much better value for your money 
 I bought this book based on all the positive customer reviews and was very disappointed in the book.  I read the book to my four year old daughter and then had to answer a very long list of questions about why all the cats were fighting and what happened to the other 999,999 cats.  Are we the only ones that don't like this book? 
 lauding the virtues of non-make up era Kiss, Motley Crue, and GNR while at the same time stomping on Priest and Maiden it is obvious Chuck Klosterman was formerly a woman. I applaud her for writing about metal from a womans perspective 
 This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book. 
 Don't buy this camera!!!  Prone to "Memory Error" & E18 errors after warranty is up.  Cost min $150 plus shipping to fix.  This camera was great until 23 months went by then I started mysteriously losing pictures due to file format errors.  I switched memory cards and it happened again.  Then the "memory error" displayed after a month or so of losing pictures.  Now it doesn't work at all.  I called canon to see what type of service could be provided and if they would fix what appears to be a factory defect since so many people have reported this problem.  Minimum cost is $150 or I could upgrade to a refurb S500 for $199 w/6 month warranty.  They have to be kidding, $250 get me a new one.  For what appears to be common problem I was expecting more from canon.  Guess I won't be buying another canon.  Google this "Canon "Memory Error" E18" and see for yourself that Canon cameras have problems. 
 A useful tool to try and get people to accept ideas (usually bad ones).  To shift your paradigm (knowledge filter) means to a) roll with the punches b) free yourself from independent thought or c) goose step...right...left...right....left...  There are plenty of used copies!  HR people love this approach because it gets the American worker to do HR's job for them, ie. brainwash herself/himself into accepting lousy ideas that will hurt the average American in the long run.  
 Interesting how this book is by a professor of law and the book starts with chapter one laying down a guilt trip for thinking differently. Not too dissimilar to socially engineering a jury to take your side out of guilt during a courtroom opening statement perhaps.  Chapter 2 is really where all of the Darwinian Evolution objections are laid out. Which could roughly be summed up as..  1)DNA contains information, information can only come from  intelligence, so there must be a god/intelligent designer.  2)Meaningful information sequences + mindless repetition can not equate into meaningful information or enhancement of information.  3) He calls for examples of information increase or enhancement. (Can't seem to say decisively)  +1) Johnson works the 'information challenge' as if life was only information. What he fails to mention is that life is about having function that serves that life form. Function can come about randomly, and information and meaning are derived from that function. Life did not start with DNA and a huge set of information, it started with one self serving function that aided in the replication of a form(now life-form) over others.  Johnson makes numerous mentions of 'natural selection' and 'mutation' but makes no mention of the fact that 99% of our genome is junk and not information. Also without mention is 'cumulative selection'. Instead he manipulates an analogy Dawkins makes to hide from the power 'cumulative selection' has on turning useless bits of junk, in to a structure with function and derived meaningful information.  +2) This point is completely ignorant and shows that hes writing in a field he has little experience with. Information can be enhanced by 'mindless repetition governed by invariable laws'. For example, Delimiters. AMAZONBOOKS2000INTELLIGENTDESIGNJOHNSON or AMAZON,BOOKS,2000,INTELLIGENTDESIGN,JOHNSON          (This alphanumeric string is meaningless unless it can serve a function. Once the function is understood it can serve as something truely informative ie. information)               Mindlessly repetitive delimiters ',' contain no actual information, but enhances the information set by providing a function, fault tolerance.  +3)He calls for examples of information increase or enhancement,without being clear on which, and that there is a differance between increase and enhancement.  This call for evidence is shown to be increasingly pointless by his inablity to ask for what type of 'information increase' such as..   total information capacity, % of capacity used, or  true(compressed) % of capacity used. or to say genetically..  genome size, # of genes, or # of active genes                           --  The last part of the book is a feeble attempt at trying to now link this 'information design theory' directly to the Bible, which I surprising found to contain no argument for. Johnson must assume his negation of Darwinism leaves the Bible as the only logical alternative so why bother the reader with an argument he/she should feel guilty at disagreeing with (makes lots of references to Chapter 1 at this point, tap into that guilt!).  This book does however serve a good purpose, that of pointing out how scientific understanding can be manipulated and the weak points in the education of that scientific understanding.  A fine work of social engineering at the least.   mikes@signull.co 
 You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's "The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes "General Theory" isn't "General" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
 I will tell you why I did not read this book. The back cover shows it is unnecessary by telling you every single tip you will get to know in this book. The tips are so simple, TOO SIMPLE, you will wonder how this guy even managed to make a book out of tips your teachers and your parents have told you a billion times. If you are a D-student, this book will help you by telling you to start working instead of writing notes to your girlfriend/boyfriend of 1 day and plans to break up. Just read the back cover and write down what you plan of doing. If you are a A/B student, go home. A poster can do the job of this book.  Another problem would be that since this tips are so simple, you may not have the attension span to read every atom of a detail behind it.  
 The title was the best part of this book.  Not worth purchasing - if you MUST read it check it out from the library or borrow it. Don't ask me for it - mine is headed for Goodwill because I can not stand to burn or trash a book. It was awful and vulgar.  Very disappointed. I hope someone else writes the book to fit the title.  Unfortunately I bought two books by the author and was disappointed with BOTH 
 The DVD quality is inferior to the VHS quality... This came as a big surprise ... The screen for the entire movie is very dark 
 I bought this book with the excitement that I would learn more about the character of Enoch and perhaps other patriarchs of the bible. I was deeply disappointed. First of all, the author just repeats the same thing over and over about Enoch being the first perfect being and he repeats a lot of the same scripture over and over again. I'm like please lets get to some new and interesting facts I didn't know about Enoch already. I know he was the perfect human being etc. etc. How about some new info. The only thing that is a little better is some good book references. I'd rather get the books he referenced. If you want a better source of Enoch get the Book of Enoch the Prophet, The Other Bible, Ethiopic Enoch and other books that go into detail. It's really disappointing when you actually get frustrated with a book before you even finish it 
 LISTEN UP!!! ... L'OCCITANE SHEA 24 HOUR ULTRA RICH FACE CREAM 1.7 OUNCE- HAS THE SAME MOISTURIZING RESULTS- FOR A FRACTION OF THE COST!!!- :) 
 A good helping of humor is good for potential grooms, but most of us need more substantial info along with it.  This book does provide a few good laughs (like the description of a diamond as an "overdigested lump of  coal -- the kidney stone of earth's urinary tract),"  but if you are  looking for actual guidance - which you most likely will need - look  elsewhere in the handful of books for grooms 
 The religion of peace is at it again!  In response to the popes words, muslims all over the world respond with violence, destruction, rage, hatred, burning down buildings, burning papal effigies, issuing fatwas against the pope, and even shooting a 70 year old nun in the back.  Wow, such peace from a religion of "peace".  If Islam is a religion of peace, then all the guns in the world are pink flowers, and every nuclear bomb, a soft feathery pillow.  Violence for words.  Destruction for speech.  PLEASE!  This is a religion of war, and bereft mindless 70 year old bags like Noam have begun to lose a lot of mental function with age.  This old bag of a man gives Muslims free passes and blames America.    Question:  When will the world start holding to account the actions of Muslims, and stop blaming others, such as Bush, America, the Pope, or God knows who else? How many more innocent people will die at the hand of Muslims before the western world finally, and for the first time, holds the Muslims accountable for their own actions, rather than someone else?      Well Im sick of the left defending this vile cesspool of Islamofacism.  Im tired of the leftist media beating up on Israel and coming to the side of middle-eastern tyrants who shoot 70 year old nuns in the back in response to spoken words.  And then these radical leftists have the audacity blame the pope!  Can you believe it?!!  Yes, idiots all over the western world actually blame the pope for the mindless violence and destruction that followed from a spoken word.  Its unreal!  A grown man got a gun, deliberately aimed it at a 70 year old woman's backside, and deliberately pulled the trigger, purposefully killing her in cold blood....and yet according to socialist America-hating leftists, he couldn't help it.  Its not his fault...its the Pope's fault guys!    Respond to words with violence, and then blame the speaker, absolving the person who actually commits the violence of responsibility.  As absurd as that sounds, I'm sad to say there are actually people all over the world who think that.  And they are idiots (like Noam) 
 this is a ridiculous overkill of two fascinating characters in the 'lonesome dove'. the whole 2 dvds were just a bunch of idiots kept blabbering, small talking, yammering, blah, blah, blah from the first second to the last minute, just like mcmurty's novels, all the characters were just kept talking, talking, talking in meaningless small talks, almost talked your ears off. it's so controversial and contradictory to those two characters first appeared in 'lonesome dove', gus talked and talked, but call never talked like what was protrayed in this pathetic 'dead man's walk' and the 'comanchi moon', the more logic one is the real sequel, 'the street of loredo', at least gus was dead, and call remained not just silent but more quiet. by watching this horrible movie adaptation from the original book, scripted by the author, the whole movie was doomed to be horrible. because mcmurty simply couldn't omitted those yammering spread all over his original novel, page after page, blah, blah, blah, and we have to find the storyline among those conversations, dialogs, and dug them out of those garbage-like paragraphs. watching this movie was no different. those idiotic morons never kept their mouths shut. blabbering day and night, even during the comanchi attacks. what call showed in this movie and the novel could never developed into a character like what he had become in 'lonesome dove'. because from the very beginning, everybody just quacked and quacked like a school of chickens. drive me nuts. how come these two young characters portrayed in this blabbering novel would and could have developed into the profound older characters in the 'lonesome dove'? once a moron, a coward, an idiot, always would be a one, no matter how old you have become. adding experiences and sophistication in the aging process never happened to a moron, coward or an idiot. how could these two jokes would have survived in that harsh environment is simply beyond me. at least the 'lonesome dove' movie adaptation was  close to what the novel read like. and 'the street of loredo' movie was also an adaptations from the novel 
 Dark Tranquillity's first album for Century Media is a disappointment.  Excessive keyboards cloud the mix, and Mikael Stanne's clean vocals are cringe-inducing.  The mood is mid-tempo quasi-goth, suggesting a second-rate Sisters of Mercy.  The songs run long, the hooks are few, and the band isn't tight.  Skip this album in favor of later, stronger efforts 
 A much condensed version would have helped but still would not have been a good story.  The end was a disappointment and the middle laborious 
 Not like the picture at all and very cheap looking and didnt form to the head correctly. Must have been stuck in the box too long!....husband said...send it back! Needless to say, we got a refund 
 There are a ton of errors in this book (including listing Roland Hanna playing piano of Charles Mingus's Mingus ah Um, when it was actually Horace Parlan). Plus ALLMUSIC.COM will list a cd at 3 stars, and this book will list it at 5, and vice versa. The reviews are supposed to be in chronological order, but are frequently out of order. But THE MOST ANNOYING, is the enormous amount of 2 or 3 star reviews that end with, "essential music", "great music", "must have". Then the next review will be 5 stars and end with "not all that essential" or a causual "worth a listen". Buy music, not thi 
 This scale does not weigh correctly. Your results depend upon exactly where you are standing on the scale when you are weighing in. I counted 6 different results within 5 minutes the last time I used it. This is one of the least accurate scales I've ever used.  Spend the extra money to get a higher quality non-digital scale 
 Yes, this is a good selection of songs from Sons of the Pioneers. Unfortunatly, the recording is also obviously created from old vinyl recordings. There is an unacceptable amount of hiss and popping on several tracks that really detracts from the music and I have yet to figure out if the recording is stereo (don't think so). I was really disappointed at the quality but for those of you who miss the nostalgia of a well-worn mono LP, give it a try. I doubt that I'll be listening to this CD much 
 This is a manual a ballet teacher might use. It's definately NOT something you give your daughter who's already in ballet. There are hardly NO pictures. It's mosting words. What good is an instructional book about ballet without pictures to show you the correct positions. Very disappointing 
 I gave these one star because I had to.  These sheets are garbage.  The colors will wash out after the first washing.  My blue sheets now have big permanent peach marks in them.  And the corners of the fitted sheet have split.  I have only had them for a month.  Love the way that they feel, however the quality is terrible.   
 The book is full of nonsense that should be simple common sense to anyone that has worked in the business world.  Mostly this book is a chance for the author to talk of his many "high level" meetings and for him to boast about all of the execs and sports figures that he knows.  This book is rather entertaining, but you will not gain much from it in the way of business or management knowledge 
 Very thin and it does not look as nice as it does on the internet. I dont think it would hold up for very long since it is so thin. 
 This is hysterical nonsense typical of right-wing ideologues posing as scholars. As a professional geographer, I shudder when I think that an accredited university gave this blowhard a Ph.D. This rant is full of ridiculous generalizations and misrepresentations. To take just one: she claims environmentalists are critical of science because of its dedication to objectivity and rationality (p.12). Of course, the reality is environmentalists make extensive use of cutting-edge science while right-wing activists like the author's husband are doing their best to undermine the use of science in the environmental policy decision-making process, whether its forest policy, pollution control, endangered species recovery, or global climate change. This is just one small example of the many mistruths Cheney perpetuates. Indeed, she rewrites history with more zest than most self-styled revisionists. Having spent all of my adult life in academia, I have encountered my fair share of flaky "postmodernists" and man-hating radical feminists. But one would get the impression from some of the reviews posted here and from Cheney's book that the academy is made up of nothing but America-haters, revisionist, anti-truth, anti-morality professional liars who brainwash our kids on a daily basis. Of course, only someone who hasn't spent any time in the classroom could possibly believe this absurd nonsense. I think my GIS professor would have been surprised to find out that his forest management research was nothing but politically correct lies, and my history professor would have been shocked to learn how "relativistic" and "perverted" his research on state constitutions was. Simply put, Cheney's book is utter and complete nonsense. It should be retitled: "Telling a Very Skewed Version of the Truth, While Turning a Blind Eye to Anything That Might Be Considered Objectionable in the History of White People, Particularly Conservatives." Please don't buy this book--you'll only encourage this pseudo-scholar 
 Seldom have I read a book that purported and looked as though it could be of interest and been so disappointed - perhaps I should have realised from the very title, insofar as most interested people rate Roger Bacon as the 'First Scientist'. The main point is however, that Mr White having conceived what he must of thought was a good idea then proceeds to regurgitate all the hoary old rhubarb that most truly interested observers consigned to the bin in their kindergartens. It is also, so dispiriting to read yet another unresearched comment about the likes of Ludovico Sforza and Lucrezia Borgia and others; and to find the chronology wrong and even some of the dates. I have not read any of Mr White's other books but I am amazed that a publisher of the quality of Little Brown should put its name to a book that overtly suggests it is authoritative but, quite clearly, is a tuppenny comic - they should be ashamed of themselves...unless of course, it is a spoof(?)...in which case it falls short of the mark on that score too 
 I love my Nikon Coolpix 5900 however, the lens failed in less than one year. Service took 6 weeks to repair. The lens failed again after less than 10 days after repair. Why is the lens failing to open again? I absolutely hate the inconvenience of returning this item again for service although I do have a paid plan for it. Why can't warranty be fast, local and competent 
 To avoid repeat, I will avoid giving a recap of the work itself. I did see the play in L.A. not too long ago and really I wasn't that impressed. Maybe it's because I am cynical and hate most modern realism, or maybe it is just that this isn't a very well wriiten/produced piece of work. I didn't care about the "complex" and "controversial" relationship the brothers' had. I didn't care about the "hip" rap-like use of rhythm and urban language, probably because rap is lame anyway, and so are cheesy gimmicks to sell a play. Oh the horror! He hates rap! He hates this play!  "But it makes us appreciate that we are not those people up on stage." Alot of plays and movies do that, but that doesn't merit making them a huge literary hit. I didn't care when Lincoln was shot by Booth...oooh that is such a deep and meaningful use of symbolism and metaphor. Oh these poor people are caught in a vicious cycle of self [decline], poverty and violence that is out of their feeble control! Thank God I am not like them. Thank God I'm not poor! Thank God I'm not stupid! Thank God I'm not Black! Or whatever else people need to be reminded of that they are sheltered from in this world. I'd rather open my eyes and look around at the misery of the world with a sense of hope and lust for life and feeling of connectiveness to the world rather than get off on a play because the characters are so pathetic that they make me feel more numb towards everyone by making me feel better about myself.

 After watching the newest version on television, this one didn't measure up. The movie didn't make you want to watch more. There was no romance compared to the latest version 
 This book is for people who never read poetry or "just don't get it" when they do.    The author focuses on why he fell in love with each poem, information that I found boring because of the way it was delivered.  He then picks apart the poems (sometimes cutting out every line, sometimes grabbing at random bits).  It takes away from the magic of a poem when someone uses pages upon pages trying to explain why it is beautiful or moving.  Those things must be felt - gained from the poem itself.    There are so many ways in which this book could have been written that would have made it uplifting, touching, or, at the very least, not boring 
 Nowhere in the description of this product did it state that it was only six inches tall, and made three (4 oz) cups.  What a disappointment 
 I bought this book based on its good reviews. My daughter was 6 weeks old when we received this. I looked through it and immediately cursed the money I wasted on it. The illustrations are not exactly what I thought her first words should be (bib, fork & spoon, butterfly, leaf, elephant, pail...). Nor were they of a uniform quality. Some look computer drawn, with crisp lines, and some look pen drawn, with slightly shaky edges. I couldn't imagine telling a story linking these pictures, or suffering through looking at it for hours -- or even 10 minutes -- while I held it for my daughter. Still, I tried to have an open mind as I introduced her to it, knowing sometimes babies like odd things. Thankfully, our tastes are the same. She has shown no special interest in this book. She looks at our Sandra Boynton board books for longer periods of time, thank goodness, since I actually enjoy those, unlike this book.  I've considered giving this book away, but I did finally find one use for it. We trot it out at get-togethers as a running joke and game among family and friends. (What the heck is that last figure anyway? A clown? A child in a snowsuit?) 
 After slogging all the way through this book, I came to Amazon, expecting to see a low rating. I am surprised to see that it has 4.5 stars (as of when I'm writing this review) and a lot of positive comments.  On the plus side, the author did take some interesting ideas and combine them in a way that makes sense. I don't mind the hours I spent reading this book because at least it made me think about a couple of things I hadn't realized before.  But on the other hand... there are really only a few important concepts in this book, and you can see what they are by reading a couple of the longer reviews here (like Coert Visser's or the one from "Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham." There's no need to read the whole thing unless you want to hear those same concepts explained over and over again 
 So I've got a bookstore, and it seems like everyone who ever attempts this book calls it tedious and gives up. So why is it that I see so many positive reviews here? Myself, I thought the authentic feel was a definite plus, (much of the time I did feel that I was reading an ancient memoir) but as for being "a page turner," as somebody else called it, you've got to be joking. This book is one of the slowest novels I've ever read. I did it on audio book and I kept falling asleep. It was a lot like sitting in Driver's Ed. after lunch and trying to keep my eyes from going out of focus. Creighton has written some pretty fun stuff, some of it even mildly thought provoking, but his is neither. Timeline and the two Jurassic Park books fit well into the whole "roller coaster of a book" thing, and personally I thought Sphere was great.  I realize that there isn't too much in the way of popular Viking fiction out there and so I suppose if you've got to have a Valhalla fix you could check this out, but I'd still recommend the Kirk Douglas movie "Vikings" over this book. Or maybe the book "Grendel" by John Gardener, which is based on the same epic poem. But this book just feels to much like a boring history lesson. 
 If you believe that Genesis is the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, and no other truth about the universe is correct, you'll probably be willing to put out the money for this book.  But why should you?  You already have the answers.  If, on the other hand, you are a practicing Christian and you want to figure out what the Creationists are about, please do read it.  If you have an open mind, I think you won't be convinced, but it should give you a pretty good idea of the level of "creationist" logic.  For anyone who considers the creation story in Genesis as one people's vision of creation or an allegorical description of creation, you probably want to look at a more balanced approach.    If such a thing exists.      A note for creationists:  If Genesis is indeed the whole truth and the sole truth, does that make incest right 
 Interestingly, I look at this issue in quite a different way. GM food is tested and has been shown to be safe. I try my best to search out GM products and avoid untested organic stuff 
 Science is about making deductions from factual evidence. It has no means of explaining anything that is supernatural.   However, religion requires the belief in supernatural forces and at least one supernatural being.   That DOES NOT mean religion is wrong, it just means it is a different subject matter than science and therefore DOES NOT belong in a science classroom.   You wouldn't expect English literature, music, history and other such subjects to be taught in a science classroom. Neither should religious beliefs. I, for one, am perfectly happy to have my religious beliefs kept out of science classrooms. I don't need science to tell me there is a God. I don't need - or want - my religious beliefs to force science to be conducted in a certain way. Quite frankly, anyone who feel that the honest teaching of science is a threat to their religious beliefs is someone who has great doubts about their religious beliefs! 
 I read this book in Florence where the novel is set and really did want to like it, however - sentiment aside - there is little to recommend. Firstly, the whole book sounds like it is written in the passive voice. The effect this has is to make nearly all the action feel distant and removed from the reader - you are never directly engaged. The author's voice is simply too detached to elicit anyone else's emotions.  Secondly, on the level of historical accuracy there is hardly any detail to critique. The city of Florence could just as well be anywhere - it's hardly described. The book purports to be set in Renaissance Italy, but it's clearly not a time or place the author had any great knowledge of, and it shows in the superficial and sometimes erroneous detail.   There is not a novel-length story here. It's a short story with potential being told in 400 pages. But without either careful historical erudition, romantic interest, or a crafted prose style, the end result is a series of remote events teeming with superfluous gore, untitillating sex, stretched plotlines and 2-dimensional characters. 
 This book's greatest flaw is, undoubtedly, its predictability.  It naturally has the descriptive and creative style of Scott, but the plot moves too logically from high point to high point with very little between.  There are very few "plot twists," and those which do occur are far from surprising.  From the book's outset, the story proceeds rapidly to the obvious tragic ending and seems to repeat regularly.  This ending also seems hurried and completely unbelievable.  The characters are poorly developed and, rather than seeming independent and realistic, seem to be nothing more than puppets forced to follow the extremely depressing plo 
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 After several hours of telephone support conversation, Belkin told me that there was simply too much interference in my apartment to allow for a connection between my Belkin Router my Belkin wireless notebook card. Mind you, I live in a one-bedroom apartment in Queens, and the distance between the router and the notebook is no more than 40 feet. On top of that, I don't have any cordless phone. So there I went and bought a range extender to place between the router and my laptop. Since then, I have spent several hours of technical support ON A WEEKLY BASIS, because the way they tell me to configure the connections and the wireless bridge just doesn't work! Oh, how I wish I had just bought a very long internet cord instead... 
 It is not a book that overview OS, but a book for people who would like to read source code. It is overloaded with details. I don't consider the book is for beginners 
 This would have made an interesting 20 page short story, but adding a couple hundred pages of character development and plot is just a waste of time. The characters are shallow and the storyline unbelievable. What university on earth would leave this thing alone with one associate professor for months on end? And then there is the clever escape from the moving car while being kidnapped - give me a break. Simply awful 
 The album title could not be more apt as this is what it does to me when I listen to it, fall into a coma. From the overly generic lyrics and repetitive nature of it all to the sheer annoyance of the female vocals (his wife) is off the scale. What made me love Collide I hate in this album. It shows no growth or anything of interest to listen to this album. Is one big long whine fest that is utterly disappointing. What a freakin shame that this crap is there next album I have been waiting for. 
 The complaints about the ending are warranted!  If you like abrupt endings ~ this may be for you.  As I searched in the book for more, my paperback edition had excerpts from am interview with the author.  Here I found part of the problem!  The author was writing this book about the difficulties in young boys' close friendships and how a small community perceives them. I feel the author did not listen to where the book was taking her.  It is much more a story about women: their deception, plotting, and conniving.  She has small town, manipulative women down perfectly. I do not think the male characters are developed enough nor do we get as much of an insight into them as we should.  If her intention was to write about male relationships, she missed the boat but write fiction about small towned women who manipulate to get what they want ~ WHOA!  Then she hit it right on 
 Well, I totally agree with previous reviewer as far as the  quality of this EarHugger. I have only one thing to say about  it..BAD BUY. Especially if you wear eye glasses like myself, using EarHugger  would be horribly uncomfortable for you. I didn't expect best performence when I bought it at its price, but I certainly didn't expect it would be that BAD! When a person with a pair of glasses wear the EarHugger, he or she wouldn't be able to use it without having to constantly adjust its position around the ear because it doesn't stay fixed longer than 5 minutes. Unless you really like the price, I recommend you not to buy this...EarHugger, especially if you wear glasses 
 Caputo's tone in the commentary, which constitutes all but the first 30 or so pages of this book, is infuriatingly cutesy and playful, and behind his cutness and attempts to paraphrase Derrida, there is very little interesting commentary. It is obvious that Caputo has a great deal of admiration and love for his subject, but beyond that, I found  an awful lot of defensive rhetoric and lots of wonderful aspects of Derrida's work completely left out of the discussion. It seems Caputo's greatest interest lies in Theology and Deconstruction, and I was interested by his brief comments about Derrida's relationship to Judaism, but he barely gets into the subject in this book, and instead recommmends that the reader read one of his several other books on Derrida. One can only hope that his other books contain more original ideas and less of his own titles in the ever-present footnotes!  Also: although this title will undoubtedly attract "beginners" to Deconstruction, I must say I am grateful that this text was not my first introduction to Derrida. While Derrida has a reputation for being difficult reading, the rewards one gets are certanly worth the effort! There is bound to be something that interests you among the titles that make up his prodigious output. Buy Dissemination, or Writing and Difference, take it in, and then check this book out of the library, read the "Roundtable", bask in the brilliance, and return it. Now you'll have more room on your bookshelf for books worth owning 
 Whoever edited this book should REALLY rethink their profession.  If you've already decided that you want to carry a handgun for self defense, you can skip the first 100 pages of this book.  If you already know something about handguns, there's almost another 100 pages you can skip.  All the information contained in this book on actually shooting a gun in self defense (tactics), you can fit into a pamphlet, while the most irrelevant, meaningless details of dozens of self-defense stories are elaborated on exhaustively. Then there's the racist innuendos.  White criminals are simply "criminals".  Black and Hispanic criminals are specifically "black" and "Hispanic".  I find it very hard to take advice from small-minded or ignorant people. The chapter on state regulations fell far short of my expectations. The author may know a lot about defending himself with a handgun - but it's painfully obvious he's spent more time shooting than he ever has writing, or reading for that matter (beyond maybe Guns & Ammo).  While trying perhaps to be comprehensive, he totally loses focus.  The only thing this is a "manual" for is how to almost completely miss the point of your title in 500 pages or less 
 I've heard Al Lee speak before and thought that what he had to say was sensible.  However, although I basically agree with his approach, I just cannot recommend his book.  I found it to be too simplistic and to contain too much filler.  There are many much better real estate investment books out there.  Some specific complaints: * The margins are ridiculously wide; this book is much smaller than it seems. * Some of the appendixes (especially appendix A) contained too much filler. * much of the book is a painfully detailed description of fields in a spreadsheet.  This sort of documentation should be directly in the spreadsheet (where it will be in sync with the latest version of the spreadsheet, etc... rather than in a book.) * When I heard Al speak in person he emphasized new homes and owning property in remote locations if needed (eg, owning property in Dallas even if one does not live there).  The book did not really touch on either of these topics.  That said, I did find a couple parts of this books to be useful or interesting.  These are: * The chapter on Financial Statements was useful; In particular the ways that items for a rental property (like rents due, funds in lender held escrow accounts, property taxes due, etc...) show up on the statements was interesting. * The tip that you can begin advertising a property for rent before you have closed on it. * The tip that you can try to time your lease expiration dates to  be during times when school is out. * The recommendation that you work with a property manager who is willing to / capable of helping you find properties to purchase 
 I didn't find this book terribly useful.  Most of the concepts presented in the book were common sense and did not specifically apply to business.  The book centered around typical social etiquette (which certainly applies  in the business world), but did not provide much business-specific  guidance.  I found that most of the concepts were covered in general  etiquette publications.  I was also disappointed to find that the book did  not provide specific solutions for breaches in business etiquette.  I guess  I was looking for some nice catch-phrases and replies for the business  user.  I do think the book was simple to read, and might be a good book for  newcomers to American business etiquette 
 When I first got into broadcasting over 30 years ago I quickly learned about radio groupies, the DJ's "biggest fans" who call the request lines to tease and flirt with the DJ in that seductive, yet deceptive voice.  Because a friend recommended that I must see this movie, I, fortunately, learned the easy way how not to fall into the trap many many DJs have gotten into and continue to get into.  I have in turn have suggested the same to new, up and comming DJs to watch, learn and heed.  Although this does a good job teaching rookie Djs a course in ethics, the film as a film kind of stinks that's why the two stars.  Poor lighting and sound makes this a true B movie 
 This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me.  This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed. 
 I purchased "ABC's of Newborn Baby Care" and another video called "Bringing Baby Home". The "ABC's" video uses a baby who is not a newborn. The umbilical cord is healed and the baby is at least three weeks old. The video does go over basic care of how to hold, change, dress a baby, bottle cleaning and baths, but skips over the details I would have found useful. "Bringing Baby Home" by the Liandrea Company is a much more complete video that uses actual newborns and parents (no actors)and covers a wider range of information. I do not recomment ABC's of Newborn Baby Care as anything but a suppliment to another video 
 Mullen's debut novel, about how the 1918 Spanish influenza epidemic affected the fictional town of Commonwealth, Washington, located at some unknown distance northeast of Seattle, is a perfect example of how NOT to write about a plague. Although the premise is intriguing and based on fact (the author notes that residents of some uninfected towns did block roads and post armed guards), neither the writing nor the plot is compelling enough to keep the reader's interest. Sixteen-year-old Philip, adopted son of the town's founder, mill owner, and leader Charles Worthy, and his feminist wife Rebecca (not supportive of the quarantine because it goes against their original goal in establishing the town - to show the world how it can be improved) is allowed to stand guard with twenty-five-year-old mill worker Graham, who he looks up to like an older brother. Shots are fired during an encounter with a tired, starving, unarmed-soldier who is hungrier than he is cautious, at which point the plot begins to really unravel.  Believing that potentially letting people die by unnecessarily exposing them to a virulent flu versus protecting them from it would "improve" the world - is not smart reasoning. Letting a teenager continue to guard the town after the firing of the initial shots ends badly - is not smart parenting. Kissing a person who might be infected - is not smart thinking. Not filling out the necessary paperwork required to legally become classified as an "essential worker" is not smart citizenship. Not developing your characters enough to compel the reader to care one way or another if any particular person dies and providing so little imagery that readers know only that the town contains tall trees - is not smart writing. Luckily for readers, however, another author, Geraldine Brooks, IS a smart writer. Her novel of the 1666 Bubonic plague, Year of Wonders, contains more character development and imagery in its first few chapters than Mullen's does in its entire length, not to mention the fact that it is also interesting and believable. Equally smart writing of a different genre can be found in John M. Barry's non-fiction book about the 1918 flu, entitled The Great Influenza. Choosy readers will choose Year of Wonders and The Great Influenza over The Last Town on Earth.  
    I was shocked at how explicitly vulgar this movie was, considering the era it was made. I didn't see that there was anything romantic about it; there would have been if someone had rewritten the script and left out the fifty-something crude jokes along with the shot of Doris Day jumping out of Rock Hudson's bed with bare legs. It wasn't tasteful at all, much more like a modern movie, and if I want to see unromantic vulgarity, I'll go to the theater and watch "Love Actually". The very reason why I watch old movies is to escape the crudeness this movie promotes!       I enjoyed "Send Me No Flowers" and "Pillow Talk" very much, but this one was off the edge. I wouldn't waste my money on it 
 I like Bose products.  I also think they are a good company, overall.  But these phones are simply mediocre in sonics.  Put them on, and they sound good enough.  But, they are inefficient and give the impression of clarity via softness.  They do not compare to $25 Philips SHE9500s sonically.  The Philips are incredible once you get the right sized ear bud on (of course, the same goes for the Bose--it is ESSENTIAL to "find the bud for you," or you'll never see the merits to in-ear phones).  If you don't think that finding the right sized bud is important, try (carefully) using in-ears WITHOUT any buds on and you'll get tinny nothingness.  You can tell the difference between these two makes by hooking them up via a large headphone adapter to a regular stereo system.  NO COMPARISON, the Philips are truly PREMIUM at c.$25 against the near $100 you serve up for the Bose.  Again, these phones are GOOD.  At $25 they'd be a fair value--even so at just under $50;  still, they would not be as good as the Philips SHE9500s.  At nearly $100, the Bose are overpriced and, in my opinion, you are paying for all the TV advertising they do.  If you have money to burn, you can't go TOO wrong with the Bose--but you CAN do better.  TWO STARS because they do work.  But since I now have five pairs of Philips SHE9500s, I doubt I will ever use the Bose again.  They are not a value.  For that, look to the Philips SHE9500s 
 While I have no doubt of Sting's genuine admiration and love for Dowland's music, the performances here simply will not do. He has obviously learned the notes very carefully, and he does make it through each of these challenging songs...but just barely.  Never do any of these performances really take off and soar and become true interpretations.  The entire enterprise remains firmly earthbound and doggedly "note-for-note" in its approach.  To be fair, subtlety and nuance never have a chance with the all-too-close "pop" miking of Sting's voice, which makes it sound like he and the excellent lutenist Edin Karamazov weren't even in the same room when performing. Moreover, Sting's proclivity for nasal vocal production and oddly colored vowels tend to render the highly poetic texts almost unintelligible.  Add to this Sting's hokey "Masterpiece Theatre"-style readings from a letter of John Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil, chief adviser to Elizabeth I, and some ill-advised multitracking effects, and the whole experience quickly becomes unlistenable.  In which case, I won't carp about the disc's rather meager running time of 48 minutes, since even at that short measure, it seems much longer.  I'm just glad I didn't shell out for the disc; I borrowed it from my local lending library, and it goes back at the end of the week 
 I agree with the review by Ilana.  Beloved is overrated and has been the vehicle by which English teachers from across the country have turned students away from reading.  One of those indecipherable books that English teachers thrive on finding hidden meaning where none exists. A muddy piece of writing 
 While The Fear Book and The Depression Book might be amongst the best books in their class, they are still complete nonsense, which doesn't say much for this class of book. I regret wasting my money. I'd sell them on but I think people, particularly suffering people, need protection from this autho 
 This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
 I purchased this after reading rave reviews as well as the recommendation by my company and was very disappointed. Even though I have a BA in Business, I'm always looking for new ideas and ways to learn.  However, I was disappointed at how much Charan oversimplified some basic terms and didn't even give a thorough defintion of "velocity" -- one of his key points.  I read in just a few hours and am giving to goodwill -- one of the few books I won't put in my home library 
      My kids have been wanting these toothbrushes since they saw the commercials for it. I thought it was a great idea. Now matter how hard I try unless I stand right next to my children every time they brush, they don't brush long enough. Since they like most of the songs available on these brushes, I thought this would work. Well it does work, I bought them today and my four year old keeps picking his up and brushing. he doesn't seem to mind the sound, but it is horrible. I thought that maybe it just needed a new battery but the battery is not replacable. I will not make this purchase again. 
 Pro's  It's really roomy.... ample room for my old brick of a computer Dell 15" inspiron 6800 and my tiny HP NC6230.  Good sized for overnight.  Con's  No compression straps when you have a smaller load to carry. I ended up ripping the nylon on the bag accidently as it got hooked on the side of a gym locker.  not as good as ripstop nylon. The zipper "teeths" aren't secure/strong enough... the bag would separate at the zippers numerous times.  Eventually, the zippers all broke loose in one night, even the separate zipper for the laptop.    
 If you need a "starter" or "disposable" bike carrier, this might be okay, but not suitable for longer trips or valuable bikes.  Good parts: Cheap, $99  Bad parts: 1.  Cheap 2.  The adapter for a 2" reciever hitch is horrible, you'll have to shim it, jury-rig something, or go to a parts store and pay for a workable one. 3.  Way too much sway, which is obvious as you put it together.  Turning corners in town have you checking your mirrors with concern.  Multiply the effect for highway speeds or bumps.  Would need to rig something. 4.  Straps holding the bikes.  Cheap, rough on your bike, and not very tight.  In summary, if you want to spend alot of time rigging it up to save a few bucks, it might be worth it, but out of the box, I wouldn't trust any worthwhile bike or vehicle with it 
 If you are familiar with this author, you'll be able to guess most of what happens in this novel.  Once again she wrote about religious fanatics.  I'm curious to know why she is so obsessed with these people.  She should write a book about that!     In THE SWITCH the characters weren't overly likeable or dislikeable and neither was the story.  Brown has a gift for keeping the reader guessing from chapter to chapter, but in this novel her attempts fell flat.  The story was too predictable and the clues were easy to pick up on, you'll definitely figure it out.  Unfortunately, I wasn't buying the romantic angle of the novel either.  For reasons I cannot say without giving something away.  If you're a Sandra Brown fan, you might enjoy this book.  It's a quick read and an interesting idea.  I think it would have been much more interesting without the religious fanatic angle.  I'm so sick of it.      
 My wife complains about falling asleep mid-way through my favorite TV Series 'Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'. Either it was carb overload from 4 hotdogs for dinner, but Robot Monster by Phil Tucker had me stumbling and writhing in more pain in my couch than my 2 herniated discs  just to stay awake and at least get my money's worth  since it was a NetFlix rental.  Its all true; the dialog was corny and special effects as valuable as the U.S. dollar after depreciation since 2000.  The highlights were 'Does Ro-Man want a date with Alice?' and the camera focusing on how to solder a radio set to communicate with the leader of Ro-Man.  But don't take my word.  Be like me and see for yourself just how really bad this movie is.  You wonder if this movie was made by idiots trying to pass for amateurs 
 No,  class not worth of money chinees printing contants very low quality this year 
 I very much enjoyed Plain and Simple, and also Everyday Sacred, so I was expecting a grand finale to a charming trilogy. Instead I encountered self-absorption to an extreme degree and despite the simplicity of the text I simply couldn't get past half way. I think Sue Bender needs to do some volunteer work, or just somehow get out of her own head for a while 
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 I was kinda disapointed by this film. Hardcore and punk can sometimes represent what is beatiful and what life should be about. But this film is just sad. To see these musicians talk about how many people they fought and how much cooler they were than the rest is not punk at all. Punk is freedom and what hardcore became is prison. The conformity they tried to escape is what they became in the end 
 The Language activities are often book specific, and the activities are designed for younger children--through 8th grade 
 I picked up this book because I was interested in future life progressions.  As one fairly conversant with the doctrines of reincarnation and recognizing this book was written over 20 years ago, my concerns are as fresh as they would have been when the book was first available:  (1) a total lack of objectivity. Dr. Goldberg has his own spiritual beliefs about reincarnation and things surrounding reincarnation, and he teaches and preaches from that viewpoint. Unfortunately, he fails to make it clear that he is teaching his personal dogma. (2)He is quick to condemn.  I was particularly struck by his blanket condemnation of all witchcraft, all covens, and by extension, all magical practices.  This bespeaks ignorance of the subject and comes from a fairly narrow view, much as if I were to give a blanket condemnation of Christianity.  Personally, I believe Christianity to be far more dangerous, but I recognize that this is opinion, and don't preach it as fact.  (3) Overall, I found his research and techniques very disorganized.  To me, this is rather sad for an accomplished hypnotist, because it diminishes his effectiveness.  Both in his writing and reporting, and in his interviews, I felt he  could greatly improve both interview and writing style by having a better idea of where he is going and the cues given by subjects.      Personally, Dr. Goldberg is not a practitioner I would select to help me with regression or progression, based on my experience with this book. There are other authors dealing with the subject.  I would direct the interested reader to a more solid author, such as Brian Weiss. 
 I never received the large bowls. The small cereal bowls were sent twice (quickly but wrong size both times) and I returned both orders. I was sent an e-mail stating something significant was wrong with the system and I would not be receiving the larger bowls. Then I got an e-mail saying I was being billed for them to which I replied what I received was NOT what I ordered and had been returned twice. I have all the paperwork on both orders. The plates I ordered were never received at all. I have NO idea what is going on now. It makes sense that I be allowed to talk to a person at this point but that isn't happening eithe 
 I thought this book would be mainly drawings similar to the cover, individual drawings that could be reproduced.  They are not.  MANY of the pages are china designs (patterns around the edges of teapots, plates, etc).  The drawings are not reproduced flat, making them difficult to use.  In some cases, I felt the drawings were a little dark as well.  I was thinking they would be a little more like a coloring book style - outlines or solids so that the pattern is clear(much like the objects on the cover), but that's rarely the case.  Some of the drawings are quite nice, but I would check this book out in person before purchase to ensure it is what you are looking for 
 I was going to use the book last week but then I realized that I had gotten a totally different book than the one I ordered.  I didn't realize it when I received it in the mail I guess 
 Michael burned up an the doc blew up in Halloween 2, end of story, end of franchise. Money hungry producers and writers need to get a brain and think of something new. The mask is even horrible in this so called film. Rest in peace Mr Plesance, I hope God let you through the pearly gates after making such horrible sequels. Currently Rob Zombie is remaking the original Halloween, what a travisty. What next, Alice Cooper remaking Jaws or Ted Nugent remaking The Godfather. Leave classics alone 
 But just add a little Spenda and cream and it is mmm, mmm, good. I can actually feel a slight boost of energy and think more clearly on the days that I drink this tea. Also, I haven't had the slightest inkling of a cold or flu. This year has been an especially bad cold and flu season for this area and I have been exposed to all of it but, knock on wood, I've been the healthiest one in the family and at work (and the only one drinking this stuff). So go figure? There are too many things good about this tea to not try it 
 Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the "who, where and why" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd 
 I bought this gift for my daughter for Christmas.  It does not work at all. It sounds like a cheap transistor radio when you attempt to adjust the knobs.  I'd like my money back 
 Let me start by stating that im a 24 year old university educated individual.  This book was thrusted into my face and forced into my brain when i was in forth grade.  It was by far the most driest and boring book i've ever read at that point in my life...and continue to be so until college.  Now, i dont remember anything at all about this book other than the fact it was about some boy writing letters to some man; but the fact that i dont remember anything gives you an idea at how little i stimulted.  Till this day, im reluctant to even bother to re-read this book and give it another chance.  I've been scarred for life.  I have no doubt that this books contains a lot of substance and insightful tales, but the thought of reading some poor pathetic boy's letters causes me to shriver.  If i would have to chose any book of my childhood that discouraged me from reading more, it would have to be this.  PLease spare your child/student from the tortures of this book.  Maybe once they've grown mentally and have the capacity and patience to understand it, it would be a great book.  But at such a young age, its a horrible read.  I noticed that this book recieved some high marks from young readers; for some reason i feel that those ratings may be incorrect and the young children's opinions may have been "clouded".  Do you teacher's know no shame?  
 Crescent reminds me of how great a period of supreme artistry that Coltrane sustained during the last few years of his life.  I feel a need to inform all fellow lovers of this period of a little known album,currently out of print, called "Infinity" that truely ranks with his best. It was rescued from the vaults back in 1972 by Alice Coltrane who added a string arrangement which truely lends a mysterious quality and produces probably the most unique Coltrane recording of all time.  I first heard this album as a teenager and its mystic tones were a religious experence for me. There is something about the music that speaks of a man who knows he is near physical death and is searching for a path to eternal life.  Please note that I accidently gave "Cresent" a one star rating - I meant to give it five stars.  
 As an American child growing up in France I had many testing experiences, but none as grisly as those that befell the future novelist Scott Landon, whose father was certifiably insane and tortured him and his older brother Paul with a sharp cutting knife.  As Stephen King tells it, early trauma caused Scott to retreat to an imaginary kingdom called "Boo'ya Moon" and then, upon emerging, to begin a career as an avant-garde novelist and Pultizer Prize winner.  Along the way he met and married a waitress with five or six sisters, Lisey Debusher, and they lived together for seventeen years until his tragic death two years before the action of the story begins, as the widow, Lisey, tries to get on with her life, dealing with the problem of Scott's archive, and if she finally feels up to disposing of it at a university library.  The remainder of the book is told from Lisey's POV, and this will be what divides King's public, her stream of consciousness-esque perceptions of every little thing of the past and present, both in Maine and in Boo'ya Moon, and the way she feels the presence of her dead husband ever near.  Most of the firestorm will be because of Lisey's pet catchphrases.  It isn't enough that she comes herself from a family ripe (overripe) with pet phrases, all of them revolting, but she married into another, and then she and Scott developed their own secret lover's code, and the reader can hardly keep it all straight.  You read on for a page or two, thinking, this can't possibly get any more precious and affected, and then, bang, you have no smucking idea.  The book improves as it goes along, although a subplot concerning Lisey's ribald older sister, Amanda, and her penchant for cutting herself, is nothing but improbable Lifetime Television for Women nonsense.  A second subplot, that focuses on a conspiracy between a scholar and a sociopath to wrest control of Scott's papers from his widow, is even more unlikely, and King's latest supervillain, the nutty Jim Dooley, is very much like the John Turturro character in the SECRET GARDEN movie.  Why does King even bother to give him a new name, it's the same character--King's fantasy of his crazed reader, I suppose.  The sexual torture of women is very much Dooley's thing and something terrible happens halfway through this book that repels me even to think about.  After forty books I am now thinking, Stephen King, your mind is a swamp and this writing excites you.  Okay, now this is one of those things that, for me was a dealbreaker.  Say you were the widow of one of the nation's top novelists, a working class woman who had come into a great deal of wealth.  Say you're now worth 20 million dollars, as Lisey is.  And say you had received telephone calls from a sexual psychopath saying he was coming to molest you.  And say he had put a dead cat in your mailbox.  Wouldn't you seek protection?  Couldn't you afford, say, a bodyguard?  Or would you do as Lisey does and just call the sheriff and nod off when he tells you that sorry, he can't help you?  Of course it's insane.  Anybody would have called a private security firm and in fact, gotten the hell out of Dodge and holed up in Ibiza until your 20 million dollars had tracked the sociopath down and had him disposed of  by hook or by crook.  No commentators have mentioned this point, so perhaps it hasn't occurred to anyone else . . .  but it led me to think, why indeed is Lisey so wealthy--I mean, why is it necessary to the story?  Wouldn't the story have worked just as well if she was an average everyday person struggling to make ends meet?  Has King forgotten that there are people who aren't zillionaires?  (In fact, why is Scott even a writer?  How was that necessary to the story?  Couldn't he just have been an accountant or something?  How many of King's heroes have been tortured novelists, it's tedious to even try listing them.)  Every now and then, King's publishers make a big deal out of his literary skills, and he drags in his "quality" writing friends to provide promising blurbs.  Amy Tan went to town to sell us BAG OF BONES.  The end of the DARK TOWER series was heralded as a major moment in contemporary writing.  Now Michael Chabon tells us that LISEY'S STORY represents some sort of gravitational shift in ecriture.  The truth is that all these books have been really terrible.  Is it just Chabon's star fever that prevents him from seeing this?  I won't be fooled again 
 If you are a rational person, you are going to balk at about 75% of this book. For instance, menstruating women aren't supposed to do clearing ceremonies. (No one bleeding can do these ceremonies.) There are other ridiculous rules and statements which are too tiresome to go into. Every once in a while, there's a helpful hint about something, and I enjoyed the bagua part (that's about placement issues), but that is not much of the book. This book is not worth your time unless you are a pretty trippy person who can suspend all logical thought for the duration of the read.. 
 We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up 
 This is not a book and I have no idea what a "sourcing fee" is.  Save your money and don't buy this item 
 Narration put me to sleep, too cliche. DVD wasn't quite what I expected.  Some good video work but too much off highway photography. I was expecting more scenery as seen from the highway. 
 This is a tough read. If you wanted an interesting book about Eninem's rise to popularity and behind the scenes dirt on how Dr Dre discovered and nurtured his raw talent, then don't buy this one because this book has NONE OF THAT! Instead, every chapter is a dry account of how Eminem's music affects American society, media and culture. Really dull stuff. He even manages to make the history of rap sound boring. I've read 18 books this year but could not get through this one. The author writes for Rolling Stone and it shows... If you've ever picked up a copy of Rolling Stone and were bored to tears by the over analyzation of music and its social impact, track-by-track, then don't buy this book 
 This film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times.  It is not comparable to other great Westerns made during the sixties.  Eli Wallach is good but confusing--who and what is he after?   The color is good and it sounds like a Sergo Leone picure but it isn't.  What a shame!!!  It could have been made better--less comedy and more plot and of course --action and suspense!!!!  Buy or rent on your own if you dare----I wouldn't 
 it's a so-so film with Rourke in the IRA. Some good stuff. Look for Anthony(Stewart Head) as Rupert(note: Anthony Stewart Head portraits another Rupert...Rupert Giles on the TV show Buffy The Vampire Slayer)so, now you know. but this one is so-so like I sai 
 I read through the 700 pages of this book, including the mathematics, hoping at some point that the Nobel Prize-winning Sen would have something to say about Rationality and Freedom. Alas! I was disappointed. About 500 pages are devoted to an almost entirely vacuous "social choice theory" and in particular Kenneth Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. I was thinking maybe that Sen was doing a "reductio ad absurdum" and at the end, he would offer an alternative approach. Unfortunately not. The salaries of the thousands of academics who are paid to do this stuff should be collected and distributed to poor people in developing countries. A far better use of the money 
 The author cannot seem to grasp that there is much discontent amongst the people. She swallows the Islamic doublespeak about women's rights but I'm sure she wouldn't tolerate one tenth of what Iranian women must endure. Also she is fixated on being a blonde in Iran. Weird 
 I don't know much about how they remaster and transfer music to CD's, but it sounds as if the originals were used to sweep up the studio floor and then transferred to CD.  Horrible, horrible quality made me eject this CD four songs in, I just can't listen to it, so now it sits on my shelf collecting dust.  It's a great collection from a true genious, but Ken Burns should be ashamed to put his name on this disc sounding the way it does.  I've heard hisses and pops, but my old records sound way better than this :- 
 She lost me totally, utterly...on the FIRST PAGE. Kirchner describes Vishnu's tent as "a camel's spit away."  A wha? Do wha?  And it turns out that's a high point. By the tenth page, I was in so much pain I had to put it down and never look at it again. Does anyone want to buy mine? I'll do one better! I'll PAY YOU TO TAKE THIS BOOK. It's not worth more than a quarter, though. So if there are no takers, this thing's going in the recycling to become something better in its next life.  Seriously. Worst...book...ever...written. 
 Robert Gilpin's work is the best-known and most influential within the Hegemonic Realist paradigm. Hegemonic Realism is a school of thought which views International Relations as organized hierarchically, with each state vying for the top position in order to gain the benefits of being the number one state. In Gilpins' words "Throughout history a principal objective of states has been the conquest of territory in order to advance economic, security, and other interests". War occurs when a rising state challenges the current hegemon, and seeks to overtake the priviliged postion. On the other hand, when one state is firmly in control, they institute a stable economic system which tends to keep the peace. There are serious problems with Hegemonic Realist theory, however, as well as Gilpin's own version of it. The first is the deductive logic behind the theory. Surely Gilpin is correct when he asserts that states have always sought conquest and territorial expansion. However, he is wrong about the motive. States seek security above all. Economic interests are not a main motive. Wars generally cost more than they could possibly gain in monetary terms. Major wars are especially costly, and no state would seek a major war with huge losses in order to gain a top position. Rather, states start wars to protect themselves from potential destruction. There are also major empirical problems with this theory, in that there really hasn't been a case of a rising power starting a war with the current hegemon. Part of this is due to the fact that Hegemonic theory only looks at the two strongest states, factoring out all the other Great Powers. But in a Multipolar system, the other states matter as well. Hegemonic Realism, for all its flaws, has made one major contribution to scholarship: The concept of state power as changing rather than fixed, as well as the concept of future expectations of power trends. This concept has been incorporated by Dale Copeland in "The Origins of Major War." Other than that however, Gilpin and his colleagues have little to offer 
 ... until two thirds of the way through it limps on withouit a credible resolution and turns in to a cross between Star Trek, Dead Ringers and The Invisible Man. With a better 3rd act this could have been great. The guy can write 
 Author Gary Wills proposes a thesis that there is no one best leader and that those great leaders have been so as a function of personal characteristics meeting the circumstances of the times.  This is a worthy and admirable approach on the surface but the author fails to adequately cite what elements or factors were key to this leadership.  Rather he settles for recounting history. This recounting is complicated with the author's political biases tending to overshadow the points the author intends to make.  There are many more effectively communicated and thoughtful books available on the subject that are devoid of left-leaning political bias.  This book is not worth the money spent on it and fortunately my book retailer took mine back for a credit 
    The seller stated book was new.  It had wear on it and the front page was cut out where the CD should have been.  I was very dissappointed in the condition.  It was too late to return it as class was starting.    This is the only time I was ever disappointed.  Usually extremely satisfied 
 I was intrigued by the title of this book, since I come into contact with all sorts of dogs regularly and am often asked advice about issues like possession guarding, dog-on-dog aggression, etc. However, the advice in this book is by no means anything I would ever pass on. Most issues are dealt with by correcting the dog harshly, shaking him, dragging him by the leash, and similar awful methods. The author's 'cure' for a dog that growls and snaps from under the bed is to daftly drag him out by the lead, and if he happens to bang his head on the way out, so much the better! She advises owners of dogs with fear aggression towards strangers to severly reprimand the dog with voice and leash corrections every time he becomes agitated around another person. This is a ridiculous way to 'help' your dog and will most likely only make the aversion worse. I noticed that Ms. Benjamin has also written a book that claims to use positive training methods, but unless her philosophy has changed from one book to the other, I would not recommend any of her material to anyone else. There are plenty of truly humane training guides out there, don't waste your money on this 
 I've used much better electric shavers in the past. I find it hard to hard to get a close shave but easy to scrape my skin. 
 For decades, many male professors have made the same excuses for sexual exploitation of their students--to the fury of feminists.  To read a feminist using the same rationalizations is both nauseating and infuriating 
 This was too much Spence for me. Having met an investigator who worked for  Spence and saw the man behind the fringe, I must say that his public  persona and actual self seem to differ substantially. After learning some  of the information that will never be written -- at least not by Spence --  I lost much of my desire to read his crafted memoir 
 At times it is good, at times I'm ready for him to either out with Puff Daddy again, and or Lionel Richie.  KRS has been getting pretty since Return Of The Boom Bap. Of course he still manages to impress here and there, but as for this album...  ...more crap than good.   I still prefer the KRS self titled CD over all 
 Denice and I grew up in the same small town in Oklahoma. It is of the utmost importance to understand how those of us who knew her were profoundly affected by her death. This heinous crime not only shook Ada, but also shook those of us who grew up with her in Purcell,OK. Denice was a sweet girl who had a smile that would light up the room. She was a year behind me in school. I recently pulled out a old High School annual. Looking at her photo brought back a rush of memories. Memories of a beautiful, innocent young woman who's life was ended in the twinkling of a eye. As important as it is that justice has been served in this case, it is even more important for all to understand that we will never forget Denice.     
 This book is a waste of time. It is boring, pedantic, unoriginal, forced, poorly written and of no practical use to music educators. Most of the theoretical ideas do not belong to Jorgensen herself; she owes her few good  ideas to other scholars in music education who Jorgensen fails to credit.  So, add poor scholarship to the above 
 I am sure there is a lesson in my experience.  I fist purchased the salt and pepper grinding mill balls and found the  salt/pepper did not go where I wanted it.  I also found that in order to get a reasonable amount out of the grinder I had to select the maximum coarse setting and over a period of six months the efficiency became so bad I finally threw them away.  Based on a salesmans advise I purchased the dual grinder thinking my problems might be isolated to the shape of the feed tube.  I am sad to say that I again found it's performance to be a big disappointment 
 I'm studying for the CPA. I bought the book because it's required for a course in school. But to actually learn for the CPA exam, I'll toss this one aside for one that provides a solutions manual. Authors who withold the manual for the instructors benefit miss a fundamental point about economics - who the customer is. It's the student that the book is written for and it is the student who pays for the course. Breffni University of Chicag 
 What's remarkable is how much gall and bravado it takes to defend a failed economic perspective AFTER it's been tested and proven wrong. Bartley, of course, was one of the chief proponents of "supply-side" economics, an extreme right-wing attitude toward economic policy that had little to do with solid economics, or indeed economic theory at all, so much as an attitude toward government and capitalism.  Even Milton Freidman, who had many valid initial points about the constraints on growth resulting from excessive taxes and over-regulation, or the delayed effects of federal monetary policy, never went this far... and non-economists like Bartley and Laffer were pretty much alone in their claims about the "magic of the marketplace" generating increased revenues by lowering taxes.  The sad thing is that, even though serious economists never bought into or supported the "supply side" concept, it didn't really matter to cranks like Bartley: their purpose was superficial populism and public-opinion essays to drum up right-wing support. And, of course, that resulted in the great Reagan-era "experiment"--which was (let's not forget) an unqualified failure by any measure.  Bartley would like to pretend otherwise--understandably, since he was largely responsible for this era of economic catastrophe. But to claim with a straight face that the supply-side policies of the 80s resulted in faster growth is simply ludicrous. Supply-side tax cuts generated a hideous and unprecedented peacetime deficit, a loss of federal revenues, a widened gap between rich and poor, and _slower_ growth. These are indisputable facts. If anyone had suggested this experiment with a full awarenss of the inevitable consequences for our society, they would be condemned as inhumane sociopaths.  But like any crackpot, Bartley isn't impressed with mere facts. You can always tell a far-right crackpot by their willingness to ignore not only the knowledge of those who've actually made their careers studying the field (i.e., "that darn ol' academia"), but also the real-world results of their tested and failed policies.  Supply-side was a disastrously bad idea with no intellectual foundation (not even among monetarists of the Friedman/Chicago school). It proved to be a complete failure. That alone should be enough to ensure that no one ever listens to Bartley again, let alone takes seriously the idea that these policies should be tried again.  But like the Evil Dead, the old supply-side notions of "tax cuts for growth" have never died in the minds of the frenetic faithful at the Wall Street Journal. So we're still dealing with this idiocy today, long after a trial run should have discredited this foolishness once and for all 
 Before you get all worked up, let me say that he has a voice, but he really doesn't have a style.  he sings songs way too straight, he makes even Bobby Short sound like an improviser!  He also doesn't seem to be in touch with his masculine side, his vocie is very, well if ying is male, and yang is female, he sounds very yang.  He needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he won't sound so obnoxious, then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying(masculine side) in his voice.  He needs to hear a few Billy Eckstine lp's.  I don't think he can change but here's hoping he'll take my advice.  As far as you buying this cd it is your decision, this is just my honest opinion 
 Oh my, what a voice, she really gets on one's nerves. In way  too much a hurry with all that she is "trying" to achieve. I could not get past the first couple of minutes of her whinny directions.   Do yourself a favor and pass this one by 
 I knew better. This is the second Victoria Moran book I've read and I didn't care for the first one either. The one star is for the plug she gave to Overeaters Anonymous. That was her best suggestion. I've got a pet peeve about finishing books that I've started to read. Besides the annoying habit of over using any remote word (this book: "assuage"), it took until page 211 that I had to close the book. In reporting the average height weight for the American female (as 5'4" and weighs 144 pounds), she states, "True, 144 pounds is too much weight for many 5'4" frames, but put this in perspective. Women in this category are not routinely keeling over from premature strokes and heart attacks."    Wow! That felt nasty! Okay, how about if 145 on a woman 5'4" was her target weight in losing many pounds. Imagine the disappointment in reading Ms. Moran's report that this is "too much weight."     Had this discouraging opinion appeared in the beginning of the book, I would have returned it to the library sooner 
 This mat may have a design flow, or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up. Layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll. In the process, the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat. I suppose it's still functional, but my brand new mat looks pretty awful 
 This book is one of the most patronising books I've ever read. If you want a quick, easy to read and extremely basic introduction to Islam this is the book for you. But if you want in depth information, analysis and objectivity you should not buy this book. For example, L'Eposito goes writes that the Six Day War was more like a 6 hour war, the man may know about religion but he sure doesn't know about Middle East history. If you really want to learn about Islam, Karen Armstrong and Bernard Lewis are far better authors than this man, and have more objective books.    
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 I ordered this book to help teach the importance of telling the truth.  It was not the classic tale I remember.  I agree with the other review that the book seemed more violent and did not express the true intent of the original tale 
 In page xvii of the introduction, Dr. Amen writes "Stimulant medications such as Adderall, Ritalin, or Dexedrine are among the safest and most effective medications in psychiatry". That sounds reassuring until you read the article in Medical News Today (August 22, 2006) mentioning that "Dexedrine and Ritalin are drugs used to treat ADHD. The FDA announced changes to their labels, and possibly those of some other ADHD drugs, to include a warning of a risk of heart problems and psychotic behavior". That is not reassuring at all. This book is writing in an authoritative style - sort of the bible of ADHD, the book that tells you what it is, and how to go about it. The only problem is that it is flawed.  
 Got the Archos to be able to take it with me when I travel for work and have movies on my flights.  The recording with the DVR station is great, but in order to hear what I recorded in a quiet room I had to have the volume turned up to 99%.  Hearing the audio with any background noise is impossible.  I contacted Amazon and got a replacement, that part was great, but the new one I have to have the volume up to 80% to hear anything in a quiet room.  I also found the that for the jack out to TV you are required to by the archos cable as it has a different pinout than a standard cable that comes with your video camera etc.  Needless to say, I will be returning the ones I have an buying another hoping it was just a bad manufacturing batch 
 This book was one of the cheesiest books I've ever read.  I actually had to force myself to finish it.  The main character (Ned) in this book seemed to experience everything.. he was frends with Harvey Milk, he was in riots, friends with a porn star, went to the first Beetles concert, saw Sylvester in concert, he was in Vietnam, etc, etc, etc.  Somehow he was every gay event except Studio 54!  It was written terribly, plots were totally contrived and loosely thrown together.  Every time the character moved his residence, I had to think of what gay event the author wanted to cram in the storyline and pretend his character participated.  No true feeling to the book, I couldn't identify with the main character... I can't believe anyone liked this book! Terrible, just terrible 
 Stephen L. Carter needs to trust his readers a bit more. He seems to think he is writing for people with the memory dysfunction dramatized in the movie Memento. He almost never introduces the Sally character without reminding us of her lifelong love for her cousin Addison. He reminds us endlessly of Mariah's obsession with conspiracy theories and her journalistic doggedness. Every time he mentions the character John Brown he reminds us that Brown is an electrical engineer. Almost every time he mentions Pastor Young we are reminded that the Pastor is a fat man and a slave to his appetites. Every time Dear Dana's ex-husband is mentioned we are reminded that he used to be married to Dana. We are reminded over and over again that Dana's lesbian relationship has gone sour. Every time Addison Garland reappears we have to be reminded of his reputation as a Casanova. Every time Lionel Eldridge appears we are reminded that he owes the narrator a term paper and is an ex-NBA star. Carter never mentions anything once. The book has a lot of characters and Carter clearly knows that they are largely indistinguishable from each other, or else so stereotypical as to be unmemorable, so he feels the constant need to remind us of which stereotype he happens to be ushering onstage at any particular point in the story. But a chart listing the large cast of characters at the beginning of the book would have been a much easier way to solve this problem. And if he could have avoided repeating the same bits of information over and over again (every five pages there is some lament for the narrator's failed marriage, some reminder of Judge Garland's bitterness, some mention of Jack Zeigler's promise to protect Misha and his family) this 660-novel could easily have been reduced to 300 pages or so. It still wouldn't have been a great novel, but it might at least have succeeded as a good fast-paced summer thriller 
 I've just finished reading "Wild Child" and am quite disappointed.  It's not as well written as I'd anticipated from reading other reviews, and although I see myself as a romantic, her story was too saccharine even for my tastes.   I will withhold my personal thoughts as to the validity of her account, not having known any of the parties involved, but it would seem odd that a brilliant, chivalrous, needy, tortured alcoholic could be as one sided as he is portrayed in this book.  I'm more likely to recommend Patricia Kennealy- Morrison's memoir to those interested in learning more about Jim Morrison.  It was infinately more readable and leaves the reader with more insight into who Jim Morrison really was.  
 I originally bought this book to give myself a crash course in how to evaluate my own homebrew beer.  My goal was then to condense the content and provide a quick and dirty process for my beer drinking friends to provide me feedback on my beer.  This book doesn't give me this.  Its a compilation of a wide range of author contributions including the lead man of contemporary homebrewing Papazian himself.  Each author's contribution is in their own style and the result is a "grab bag" of chapters without a lot of cohesiveness between them. While some of the chapters are decent others are pretty weak and never really deliver any substance.  In the end this book reads like a random collection of chapters that falls way short of enlightening you on how to evaulate beer.  I even recognize some recycled text from some of Papazian's other books.  Not cool 
 Three problems with this film:  1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.    2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.    3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.    Don't waste your life.  ALon 
 Imagine someone combining the scripts for Zardoz and Independence Day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing....then you would have Battlefield Earth.  It is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars.  You become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of John Travolta putting his heart and soul into a project.   Just awful. If Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash were humans they would deserve to be executed 
 When I got Kerplunk home and opened the box, I was dumbfounded.  The game was this little plastic thing made from cheap materials.  As a kid, we had Kerplunk and it was much taller and wider.  It was made of a heavier plastic, too. You could be extra careful when you removed the straws because the whole thing was solid and wouldn't budge.  The new one is so little, you have to hold it with one hand while you pull the straw, making it difficult to move carefully.  I think this is the same type of problem parents are having with retro games.  The toy manufacturers know the parent will say, "I had this game when I was a kid, so I'll buy it for my kid!"  Unfortunately, the new versions are smaller, cheaper and more fragile. If the original version of a game is what is desired, then a parent will have to buy an old game from Ebay.  This is actually a cool game, just not the new version 
 The recurring imagery of Perdido Street Station is of grandiose plans, half-finished, poorly maintained, and nonfunctional.  Unfortunately, what is true of the setting extends to that of the novel itself.  It's not a novel for everyone.  The characters and setting are grubby, dirty, ugly, grasping and selfish.  If one gets through the first hundred pages, the hook is set fast and the brilliant story-telling and setting pull one in.  The plot, the meandering plot, centers around the cast-off scientist Isaac and his experiment to return flight to a wingless bird-man.  The experiment, of course, goes wrong.  Dreadfully wrong.  But...  that's the problem as well.  Mieville has crafted a truly vast and fascinating storyscape.  The city and people and races of New Crobuzon live and breath with the same fascinating perversity as those of Castle Gormenghast or Melnibone or, dare I say it, Middle-Earth.  The first appearance of the Weaver alone makes the story very difficult to put down.  The story draws one in.  But ultimately, Mieville loses control of his own narrative.  Like Isaac's own experiment, the plot goes wrong.  Dreadfully wrong.  Mieville has to wheel in one of the most obvious deus ex machina devices I've ever seen outside of a Spielberg movie.  What follows is a wholly contrived and inexplicable conclusion, accompanied by a sputtering denouement puffed up with its own bizarre self-righteousness.  The only thing missing from the end is Fonzie, a speedboat, and a shark ready to be jumped.  I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to anyone.  If the first hundred pages disgusts, it should be put down.  If the first hundred pages fascinate, it should be put down, as the last hundred surely will disgust even more. 
 We ordered this for a spare fridge and it would be a great size, but the first on came and it was damaged. It looked like it had been dropped. Then I called Target. They did great taking care of getting us another on. Only the second came today and it was also dropped from a truck. The back was dented and it was already rusting. so I think we will try some where else for this item.   
 Layard gives a superficial overview of some economic and psycological research. He uses this research to advocate governmental management of happiness, which is the primary theme of the book. Whether or not you agree with that idea, this book's flawed logic and rambiling prose is unilkley to convince anyone either way.   Layard proposes several policies intended to increase happiness including prohibition of vice, increased taxation, redistribution of wealth, and general intervention in the economy. Naturally, his authoritarian proposals for collective happiness largley ignore individual rights and freedom. They also ignore the fact that similar policies have failed when attempted by governments throughout history.   What is clear is that if the department of happiness comes to be, the central planner's idea of happiness won't be mine, and it won't be yours either. 
 "The Ragamuffin Gospel" is a well-written and emotionally persuasive book that tells the truth--but stops short of telling the full truth. In a conversational, sometimes autobiographical, and often eloquent style, Manning aims his message at Christians who have been crushed by the legalism that some religious people feel compelled to pass off as the Gospel. We should not pretend to be better than we are, says Manning. Instead, we must admit that we are all "ragamuffins," believing absolutely in God's love and forgiveness. As spiritual "children" we do not have anything we can give God; all we can do is trust in God's grace and we will be justified in His sight. This is the heart of Jesus' message, exemplified most beautifully in the parable of the prodigal son. Followers of Christ desperately need "to join Magdalene and Peter in witnessing that Christianity is not primarily a moral code but a grace-laden mystery; it is not essentially a philosophy of love but a love affair; it is not keeping rules with clenched fists but receiving a gift with open hands" (p. 211).  Up to this point I wholeheartedly agree with Manning. He is to be commended for assailing legalism, as it is certainly a distortion of the Gospel, and constitutes a grave threat to the spiritual life of Christians. Problems arise, however, in his understanding of the Pauline concept of faith, insofar as his thesis stands on an interpretation of "justification by grace through faith." Thankfully, Manning's purpose keeps him from the reductionist equation of faith with a mere "statement of belief" (i.e. faith is synonymous with assent to and/or denial of certain intellectual propositions, regardless of what devotion these propositions might require), as some Christians seem to have done with Paul's thought. Instead, in his zeal to undermine legalism, he effectively separates the concepts of "faith" and "works" from each other. The problem is that this separation is found nowhere in Paul's thought, and in fact, nowhere in the New Testament. It is, in truth, this separation of faith and works that lies at the root of both licentiousness and legalism. True faith always implies works; without works it is not really faith, since faith as "trust" is exemplified in the way we live. Similarly, true works are always "acts of faith;" stripped of faith they are not really acts of trustworthiness but a dead formalism. Legalism and licentiousness are merely opposite sides of the same coin. Manning rightly deplores legalism, but does not connect it to a lack of true faith; in this he is in unwitting danger of promoting the very thing he hates. And because he does not unify the concepts of faith and works, he is unable to grasp the full weight of the Pauline understanding of faith, or of grace working through faith, leading him to conclude that "grace stands in opposition to works" (p. 38). But to confess with Paul that humanity cannot "earn" its salvation by works does not require works to be the enemy of faith or of grace. By doing so the "Ragamuffin Gospel" offers a kind of "grace," but not a grace realized through faith.  Ultimately, grace is not grace without a crucifixion of sin. It isn't even "cheap grace," as Dietrich Bonhoeffer called it--it just simply isn't grace at all. And a crucifixion of sin involves not only Christ's crucifixion but ours as well. The lives of the great saints and martyrs of the Church testify to an unmerited saving grace, to be sure, but never to a salvation without effort or trial. "The Ragamuffin Gospel" preaches "Christ, and him crucified," but does so in order that we might avoid being crucified with him 
 The FBI could not have created a better person to sow the seeds of destruction for the Black Panther Party than Eldridge Cleaver.   The treatise from jail - before Cleaver became a BPP member - catapulted him into the 1960s revolutionary/black power movements. But his so-called consciousness was never for the greater good of the whole.  Cleaver failed to gain control of the BPP during his time in exile - and when he was essentially booted out of Cuba - by making what he felt was a left-turn by placing the organization into solidarity with nation's "at war" with U.S. imperialism. The attempted coup was foiled when Huey Newton kicked Cleaver and his followers out of the party. But Cleaver sounded so good when barking out orders thousands of miles away!  The split began the fragmentation of the party. I contend it was the cornerstone development for the U.S. government to manipulate as a means to destroy the party from within. And I still have questions concerning the police shoot-out where Cleaver emerged basically unscathed, but his comrade in arms was shot dead.  Cleaver - a convicted rapist - was legendary for his physical/verbal abuse of women. Again, the sickening spector of control through intimidation.   It should have come as no surprise to anyone that years later Cleaver made an abrupt political turn into a right-extremist camp. He feared not being the head of the game, and with no place to turn on the left, Cleaver scampered to the right in hopes his new friends would pick him as captain of the team.  As a slice of American History, Soul On Ice remains an essential read. But Cleaver's ideology cut severe wounds in the BPP, caused death and dissension, while arguably driving Newton into consolidating a national party into one Oakland chapter.   Cleaver a revolutionary? Hardly. An egotistical coward? Yes.    
 The reviews say that Lisa A. Johnson's book offers good suggestions on how to be a good companion and not a gold digger: I am glad about it. Yet, she is advising on how to date not just anybody, but specifically THE RICH. Does she mean that the rest of us is not entitled to the same self-confidence and emotional support in a companion? Are we honest, sensitive, understanding, compassionate common men (teachers, small businness owners, musicians, employees, local journalists etc.) condemned to be our self-despising girfriends' cheapo-free therapists 
 This book looks to be an in-depth expose of the lives of presidents since Kennedy.  However, it quickly turns into a anti-Democrat and Clinton-bashing book.  Johnson is portrayed as a compulsive liar and serial adulterer and Carter is described as a disingenuous hypoctite.  Reagan, on the other hand, is portrayed as a nice man who was a wonderful human being.  While this may be true, it is worth noting that this is the same man who lied to the American people about his knowledge of the Iran-Contra scandal and who left office with the worst budget deficit and highest unemployment rate in American history.  This man also declared war on the world power that is Granada and bombed that country back to the Stone Age.  The auther seems enthralled by Reagan and repeatedly describes him as a great communicator (which he was) and a man who could make you feel good.  Of course Reagan could do these things...he was an ACTOR!  That is what actors do!  The worst part of the book is the end.  Kessler wrote this piece in 1995, just over 3 years into the Clinton presidenc.  Yet, criticism of Clinton dominates the book and is almost 2.5 times as long as the chapters on Reagan, Johnson, and Nixon who each served over 4 years.  Kessler condemns the press for not investigating Clinton's lies about his philandering and makes the case that since Clinton can't keep his Billy in his pants he is unfit to be president.  If that were the ultimate judge of a man's ability to govern a country, most of the world's countries would be left without a leader.  Also, U.S. presidents throughout history have had mistresses: Jefferson, Cleveland, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Roosevelt among others.  The fact is this book does not reveal any bombshells about president's secret lives; all it reveals is Clinton's healthy extramarital sexcapades.  Clinton-haters should love this book, though there are better books available on the subject 
 This deck is better than Kaiba's. People usually only buy Kaiba's deck for the Blue Eyes.. but if you want it so bad, buy it seperate. Yugi's deck actually has a strategy set in in. It's got an assorted variety off all types of cards, and no, I'm not only saying this because it's got a stupid axe of despair and a Black Luster Soldier, but because it's a strategic deck that's been put together for us to buy. But don't try using this in tournaments because most people know this deck like the back of their head. Wait, do people know what the back of their head looks like? Hang on, wait a moment while I try andd see the back of my head.. = 
 Why?  Why waste your time and money on producing crap?  Sony execs must be out of their minds. The Ghostbuster fans have been waiting years, and writing countless petitions to get the episodes on DVD, and this is what they come up with?  No. Give us season DVDs. Give us a 140 episode box set. Give us something. Not 4 non-sequential episodes on a disc that can hold MANY times that.  What a waste. This product gets 1 star because, apparently, you can't give it zero 
 This book has a volume number - it is one of a series of monographs that have been published.  I am looking volume 231, but since you don't mention the volume number I don't know if this is the volume I'm seeking.  I will go elsewhere for my purchase 
 I've read some Faulkner now, some required, most voluntarily, and still have yet to figure out what the fuss is about. Yes he can weave a story, but good grief, imagine the ego of a man who thinks he can turn out a story as incomprehensible as this. Right now I'm reading his bio by Jay Parini trying to decipher the Faulkner code.  I'll let you know if I do. I guess I've just read too much Flannery O'Conner (brilliant) and consider Faulkner a bit too precious. Slam me if you must. "A Light in August" was good, and I'm reading short stories that are wonderful, but please, present and future authors, try to engage the reader, not send him/her away frustrated 
 Having so much enjoyed the first two volumnes in this series, I was not prepared for this turgid list of self improvement. Yes Clive is well read, English and Italian, yes he does know the difference between a Donatello and a Michelangelo, but do we need to know every book he read in the two years, every painting he saw and how it moved him. The simple answer is no. Unfortunately it takes 250 pages to find out. The story of how a drunken extemely funny youth becomes a sober mildly funny old pseud 
 Save your money. This is about a lightweight book as you can buy on real estate. A synopsis is, buy a house, fix it up, rent it for a while then sell it. Whoopee. Supposedly this is for beginners, but there isn't enough here to educate a beginner on how to progress. If you have never purchased a house, even the one you presently live in, it may educate you somewhat, but there are better books for investors, even beginners 
 Constantine was the subject of much teen-girl hype during his stint on idol, but that was largely due to his attempts to smolder the camera.  Buy a poster if you think he's sexy.  Skip this and any other CD with Con if you care about decent music 
 These authors, and this book (in an earlier edition) were the first wave of today's spam onlsaught.  If you need immigration information, please look elsewhere.  If you -really- want this book, please buy the used copy.  In the perusing of it that I've done, I found it to be not entirely uninformative, but I certainly wouldn't give it accolades, and, given it (and its authors') background, I wouldn't pay money for it if you held a gun to my head.  Go ahead: type "Canter and Siebel" into Google, and see what you get 
 After reading four books on knife fighting, I'm beginning to realize there's not much more to be said, especially when Richard Ryan is saying it. "Pathetic" he calls man. A "walking sack of meat." No built-in mechanisms for defense, obviously not a predator by nature. Man had to "claw his way up" the foodchain.  Is this guy for real?  If you begin with a false premise, you can only get better and there are some relevant material in the book--if you can get past Ryan's flaming ego, which doesn't take long to become a smoldering ember.  But with all the useful information which, by the way, you can get elsewhere in far more entertaining ways, Ryan rapidly becomes tedious to read. The truth is, man has always been the most dangerous creature roaming this planet. Even cave deptictions show groups of armed men taking down creatures much larger and faster than themselves. And did anyone notice that most of early man wore fur and leather footwear.  It wasn't only weapons that made man dangerous, it was his resourcefulness and, did anyone say fire? Given to mortal man by the immortal Prometheus, it made man almost as powerful as the gods. Soon Greeks were putting sticks into the ground and mathematically figuring out the circumference of the globe. Then Persians, Greeks and Romans were making war using horses and elephants, and bronze and leather weapons, marching in formation and boldly claiming dominance over the land. Pathetic? "Walking sacks of meat?" Oh, and let's not forget in God's image.  The bottom line in knife fighting is, if someone wants to kill you with a knife, he probably will if he's smart enough and committed enough. Very few people are "called out" for knife fighting -- dirks have always been an assasin's tool, nearly everyone's last choice for going at it in the so-called "circle of death" in a fair fight.  When you can see the bad guy coming. When you see the predator's gleam in his eyes, then a knife can come in very handy. Tick someone off in a bar and a blade's likely to end up in your ribs before you can try all that macho knife stuff you learned.  A fellow I once knew pulled out a giant fold-out knife and laid it on the table so I could get a good look at it. Then he told me about two guys who were following him one night in a bad section of D.C. He turned and faced them, pulling out the knife and letting them see its glittering blade before he palmed it.  "Yeah, well what would you have done if they'd pulled out knives of their own and come after you?" He shrugged and replied, "I would have shot them."    
 It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters.  Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while).  There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had.  The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors.  
 What a disappointment!  There is no documentation whatsoever.  For example, astronomers and astrologers agree that there are fixed stars assigned to every day of the year (and used for birthdays), but none appear here.  This author cites stars, but gives no hint of where/how she arrived at them (and, no, they're not the same as fixed stars).  Likewise, she cites guardian angels for each day of birth, but, again, her's differ from those in other books, but give no hint of where/how she arrived at them.  She assigns everything from trees to composers to each DOB, but gives no hint of whether these are well-researched, or figments of her imagination.  Moreover, padding is used to make the book look much fatter than it really is ... If there are only eleven guardian angels, there is no need to repeat the definition of each one on every page -- and this is done for all subjects and topics.  In short, this book was a huge disappointment, and is being returned.  I don't understand why the author couldn't cite any sources or give any clues to how she arrived at her information. A bibliography would have been ideal, but if she'd at least briefly referenced this, it would have been okay.  Without it, the book was garbage 
  Sorry but this book was a no no. I was so disappointed the whole story really did'nt come together at all plus the summary on the back of the book did'nt match with the story inside the book.I thought it was just my copy but after reading a few reviews I realized that i was'nt.please save your self from wasting your time with this book cause it is really not worth it 
 This would have to be the worst book I have ever read.Wow Will is running from dead people. Some one is trying to kill him so cool.How much more boring can you get.I would not recommend this book to a cave man or any thing for that mater. So what I'm saying is it stinks 
 I've had two of these.  Both sounded and worked well for a few months.  then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second.  When this happens, you're perfectly operating  earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery.  While it's perfmance was good before the break, the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of "memory titanum" or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste (battery contains lithium I bet)   Skip by this one if you're smart.  I've been had twice 
 After I read this book, I was siezed by an uncontrollable desire to pave my front yard 
 Indeed,there is a need for a continuation of regulated gun-control,in America.Yet,Michael Moore uses terrible examples to prove his point and humorously distorts the facts.Moore's end product does not justify the means.Eventhough Moore doesn't use a gun to kill ,he's the very essence of the "drive-by media".Why didn't he do a film on pukeheads who recklessly abuse their right to own a gun?-Answer-because that would give honest people the validation to bear arms. The people he points to ,in the film, who have done the shootings,are kids.After years of watching violent images,via videogames,and no parental control led them to that destructive behavior.Not the K-Mart availableness of the rifles and the bullets. The eschatological preachers of the elusive Doomsday,like David Karesch,do have a right to gun-ownership.But not for Holy War,against the American government and Pagan socialists alike.Now,Tim McVeigh's senseless bombing ,had more to do with his anti-social delusions ,rather than his true feelings about legal restrictions on unlimited gun-ownership.(If it wasn't for the song ,"Happiness is a Warm Gun", John Lennon may not have been shot by the maniacal subliminal Beatle listener,Mark David Chapman.) Charlton Heston supports ownership of hunting rifles,for sport and protection.The surprise Moore attack on Heston,was ridiculous.Like comparing apples to oranges.Moore shows himself as an opportunist,and not a gentleman.Dick Clark owns some music restaurant chain,where a black woman was directed to work at one.How is he to know,about her family members possessing guns or not?She broke the law,and Clark can not be held responsible for her domestic negligence.The careless woman's family promoted an un-healthy atmosphere for their dear children.Moore's subreptitious inferences are highly entertaining,but divert from the root cause of the lethal gun shootings,in America.   
 It's a long read, the characters are boring, and the ending makes no sense at all.  It is neither funny nor thrilling. It's just plain dull 
 I've made 2 of the recipes so far and am reluctant to try more. If I had known what I now know BEFORE I bought the book, I'd never have bought it.   The first recipe was a complete bomb: the Tofu and Vegetable Curry, p. 105. I found it too hot and also bitter. Thin, watery gravy; very hot; and a nasty, bitter taste -- yuck! I love curries, but this was by far the worst I've ever tasted. I'll never make it again!  The Butternut Squash Soup, p. 98, was a little better. I liked it, but my husband didn't and wouldn't eat it (complained of a sour-milk taste). The soy milk and perhaps also the margarine had curdled over the long hours of cooking. And since cut-up squash isn't available in my town, the recipe took an hour of hard work, mostly to dismember a fresh butternut squash. I'll make this again when I can find cut-up squash, but I'll leave out the soy milk and margarine during the slow cooking. When the slow cooking is done, I'll puree the soup, then add the soy milk and margarine, and reheat gently on the stovetop. I think this will avoid the curdling and yield a creamier product.  My recommendation to others: don't waste your money on this clunker 
 I am an avid reader of Ragnar Benson's books.I found most of his books very practical and useful for emergency situations. Un fortunately, this is not one of those books. I expected the book to be more practical in the sense that plants and other items found in the woods and local environment would be addressed as part of the concepts presented. This book is too impractical for my learning needs. Although this book is not up to par for me, I do recommend that readers explore some of the authors other works 
 Don't buy this fan, unless you can put up with noise it will make on high speed.  Also, if it has green lights(like my blizzard fan did), it will light up a dark room at night. Also, you will see the fan shadow on your ceiling.  Low speed is quiet enough for sleeping, but high will disturb you. The angle tilt adjustments are not precise, and are difficult to do.  There are better choices 
 The begining of this book has lots of useful information including digging and diving for bottles. However, I was disappointed with the amount of pictures. The descriptions for most bottles were vague. I rated it a 2 because of the extensive listing of Jim Beam bottles. If you collect Jim Beam this would be a worthwhile book 
 I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen! And confusing too! The are a lot of bad flash backs, and fast-fast forward scenes of boats tied up in a dock, with the sun coming up or down.   Lew(Dominic Purcell) is laughable as a sign painter.  There is actually a scene where he is bent double hammering over his head on to a sign he's working on, that is down on the ground and half burried in the dusty dirt! You can tell he dosen't have a clue to what he is doing!  Then after he finds out about the planned kidnapping, he is supposly sneeking, and peeking around bushes. Like a man of Purcell's size(he's 6'1"or so, and wieghs about 200 pounds) can sneek around in someone's front yard and not be seen?  Come on! I kept waiting for someone to call 911 to report a peeking Tom!  I have to warn you that there are a lot of sex scenes!  Bad ones at that! I guess the director wanted to get them over with-real fast-to move on to the next badly written scene!   At least you get to see Dominic Purcells nude butt! Which maybe the only reason to see this movie, if you like that sort of thing!  And Purcell gets beaten up alot-by everyone in this movie. I kept thinking 'come on Purcell your a big guy, you can take that little guy!' And worse a woman beats him up too!  I saw this listed as a comedy, well maybe a comedy of errors!  While being intervied Dominic Purcell dosen't even mention this movie, when he lists all the movies that he has been-in.    And that should say something about this movie, if the guy who starred in it, would NOT even SAY he'd been in it 
 this is the worst scarface record to date weak beats,the homies suck.what happened to the original homies from the old rap-a-lot days.get the first my homies but dont buy this crap 
 Why did they not republish the first edition that tasted of strawberries  and cheese. This new version, with it's claims of a "lighter  nuttier" taste, is plain awfu 
 Many telling points, but the book is flawed.  It is very repetitive and judging by the many misrepresentations of Catholicism in it, which the author could easily have checked, I am not sure how accurate the book is on Islam.  I would imagine there is a more focused and objective book on the subject somewhere 
 The Affluent Society is no longer relevant to contemporary economics.  It was written in 1958, when the world was mired in the Cold War.  Not only is this book irrelevant, it is also elitist and arrogant.  Galbraith says that people who belied Karl Marx were inherently more intelligent.  I think it is about time to stop calling an irrelevant book a classic 
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library 
  Well, Well, Well, where do I start? I didn't hate this book and I didn't love this book. I did like some of the characters a lot, but there are other characters I wanted to just be abducted by aliens and disappear. The author lost me when she started making mountains out of mole hills. Candace's character was so over developed in my opinion. She was soooooooooo boring!!!! I did not understand why she was a main character. I also did not like the constant bickering about the interracial relationship. What year is it? Who cares this much? Obviously these characters cared enough to talk about it every other page. I do not read a book to identify with every single character, but these people made the biggest deals over absolutely nothing. Now the only reason the book received the two stars instead of one was because of three characters Jolene Barbara and Bradford. Their parts made the book worth reading and prompted me to order part two "Can't Get Enough" that and I am a sucker for a sequel. I just hope that Mrs.Briscoe dumps the unneeded people in part two. 
 I waited to read this book and was totally disgusted with it. It was more of a history about her mother (who was no doubt certifiable). Ms Wood dedicated her life, for good or for bad, to the Screen. The least this author could have done was not to  write it like someone was standing over his shoulder! 
 Would have been 5 stars, but ...  Wait for the second edition. Ruby on Rails has changed very much. If you (as of this writing) search for the ISBN (0977616630) of the second edition, Amazon will "find" the first edition (ISBN: 097669400X) 
 The idea behind the book is great, but the book itself fails to meet  expectations. The description on Native American life seemed  superficial  and like it had no experience or research behind it.  The charachters were  good, but the whole book seemed like a rough draft.The story never went  into enough detail. It jumped from one event to another without ever  spending enough time on each event to interest me.My advice is to skip it 
 Gail Griffith writes very well and this is indeed a gripping story.  Lots of compassion is demonstrated for suicidal and depressed teens.  Nevertheless the book is very one-sided and misguided in its presentation of the benefits of antidepressant therapy.  This is particularly surprising in light of the fact Will so clearly demonstrates adverse side effects, even the beginning of serotonin syndrome, well before his suicide attempt.  This is not surprising in light of the enormous doses of three different drugs that he had only been taking for a relatively short time - enormous for someone only 17 years of age, 6 feet tall and reputedly less than 150 pounds, very thin for that height.  He was nauseous, vomiting and had significant memory loss.  In addition his suicide notes are examples of a dissociative state, in which one feels one is watching from outside oneself with no real sense of the consequences of one's actions, that has been reported repeatedly by survivors of antidepressant harm.  The fact that his own doctor and the doctors who endorse the book do not recognize this is a sorry testimony to the influence of the pharmaceutical industry over the psychiatric profession.  The other endorsements come ironically from Andrew Solomon and Paul Raeburn who have themselves inadvertently described adverse events dramatically in their own writing.  I hope readers will examine more critically the differences between underlying depression and the adverse effects of mind altering drugs.  
 This book gave lots and lots of arguments that were very nice and well thoughtout, but it often seemed that the point-counterpoint "arguing" was a little redundant. The whole book consisted of an article or an event that had to do with the ethics of euthanasia and two people with conflicting views would write why. I wish that the book had some documented dialog between the two opinions. It was a little boring reading the same opinions over and over again. "euthanasia as long as it is consentual and necessary should be permitted yada yada yada" "killing another innocent being should not be permitted at all because it is murder yada yada yada" Each and every writer was very elegant and well spoken, but I simply wish there was more dialog between the two people, not simply between book editors 
 Well I don't know.. after reading the reviews myself, it's clear to me that a certain "type" of person buys this book- one that is largely interested in math.  I am not one of those people, and my review is unique because I am actually in the process of using this book for an introductory math course at the University of Texas at Austin. Let me tell you, I absolutely hate it. It is beyond frustrating- I find the explanations to be extremely vague and confusing, and often find myself looking up secondary sources just to try and figure out what in the world it's talking about. It's not just me, either- the average grade on the first exam was about 47/100, and we were given a HUGE curve. My teacher basically recites from the text verbatim, which is another indictment against this book. I literally cannot find the words to express how much I despise the Heart of Mathematics.  If you are someone who finds themselves in a math course that is using this book, my advice is to switch out IMMEDIATELY. Everyone else- hey, if you like math, this is up your alley, judging by the reviews. 
 This novel reads more like an outline with big holes in both the character development and the plot.  Unlike the professional reviews, I didn't mind the excerpts that were the foundation of the historical quest - what bothered me were the characters themselves.  I found their behavior to be at times bizarre and had a hard time liking any of them.  The situations and the characters' reactions were far-fetched with no surrounding build-up of detail to back up the plot.  I give this 2 stars for originality and 0 stars for detail and character development 
 I actually had this on my shelf for 2 or 3 years. I tried to watch it a time or 2 and just could not get past the first 10 or 15 minutes. I was finally in the mood to watch it the other night. Let me say I am a big fan of Ashley Judd and I have loved every movie I have seen her in. She did a great job, as always, just poor script writing. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered, such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms, etc. This fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point? I may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something I missed... 
 "Internal Combustion" by Edwin Black is an entertaining but uneven history about the control of energy with a purported emphasis on the ascendancy of the gasoline-powered automobile. To his credit, Mr. Black has managed a substantive research project that has uncovered a great deal of arcane historic information about the automotive industry. Unfortunately, this preachy book suffers from an acute lack of focus, where it is suspected that the large amounts of extraneous background material was added in an attempt to obscure the book's shortcomings. Indeed, the author ultimately fails to prove his central thesis, thereby casting doubt about the validity of both his research and his conclusions.  Mr. Black opens the book with a scene depicting the burning of Thomas Edison's research laboratories in December, 1914. Mr. Black's conspiracy theory proposes that sinister forces aligned with the gasoline-burning automotive industry may have intentionally destroyed the world's one and only hope to mass-produce an electric car. Unfortunately, Mr. Black provides no evidence to prove this allegation.    Mr. Black attempts to buttress his case by explaining that electric vehicles were once utilized as taxis in New York and other major cities in the late nineteenth century and, therefore, could have and should have been mass marketed to an appreciative public. We are supposed to accept Mr. Black's thesis that success would have been an inevitable and logical outcome despite the severe weight, cost and range limitations of the electric car when compared with the gasoline automobile. In fact, while Thomas Edison and Henry Ford were still tinkering with an electric alternative a full thirteen years after gasoline-powered vehicles had already been in mass production, it is evident to the reader that internal combustion vehicles prevailed because they were affordable, the first to market and could traverse longer distances than electric cars. That all of this was not a good development for people's health and the environment is not in dispute; rather, it is Mr. Black's contention that the white-hatted purveyors of electric vehicles could have prevailed save for the obstructionism of the black-hatted petroleum industry that remains in question.    In the end, what is conspicuously lacking throughout the book is a credible attempt at analyzing and critiquing the history of governmental and popular struggle with the fossil-fuel industry. But instead of scholarship, we have a vainglorious author who is determined to salvage the barren results of two years' worth of study by substituting analysis with a highly questionable work of narrative. The end result is little more than a masquerade of nonfiction; at best, it is a book that might have limited appeal to readers who crave pseudo-historicism at the expense of intellectual rigor, consistency, insight or coherence. 
 	The saga of the candyman continues in this third installment of the hit series. I can remember the first time I watched the original created by Clive Barker, I luv'd it, the same can't be said for this film. Caroline is last living descendent of the candyman, and he wants to end it all by ending her. All who watch this film and the acting of Donna D' Errico will wish for the same thing. One would only think that she got the job to secure watchers of Baywatch for the film and for that reason only, or maybe it's because a little fragile thing like her can't take on candyman head on. Get a real actress like KATHY BATES in there and she'll kick his ass {MISERY is a classic}. As far as Tony Todd is concerned he does a good job in this film, but not as scary as he has been in the other films. He does a good job none the less, and serves as a co-producer. As far as the script goes it's a decent attempt at the franchise, Al Septien & director Turi Meyer do what they can. But that doesn't save the film from being less then average. Side performances from the art gallery owner, the two bad cops, and the gypsy women are great and save the film a little.  	There isn't much to the story, Caroline is his last descendent and he wants to stop his pain by taking her. People she knows gets killed so it looks like she did it, and she tries to stop him, that's it nothing more to it. Over all a more worthy sequel of its predecessors would be more enjoyable. 
 I was very disappointed in the quality of the writing. The plot is weak. The authors try to use foreshadowing and do not pull it off. That may be part of the problem - two authors who don't write as one. The whole story is sadly not worth the read. Save your money. Read the authors' note at the back of the book if you are thinking of buying it. I am sending my copy back to the publisher with a note,it is that bad. I would have given a zero if it was an option. 
 The book covers the process of smoking well. Good information on brining, sausage making, and processing smoked foods is provided. It lacks fundamental data such as internal temperatures of smoke cook meats. A few  recipes are presented, but this is not a cookbook 
 I have read a lot of Michael Crichton and thought it intelligent and interesting.  After just finishing "Travels" this afternoon, I have to admit that I hated it.  I know that this book was about his inner and outer travels in life in which he reaches self discovery, but in reality it is one of the most self obsessed books I have ever read.  He whines and complains and tries to find excuses for his bad behavior and his inability to have a meaningful relationship.  Instead of looking at the international travel (as little as he actually talks about it) as a great opportunity to learn about other cultures for who they are, he is continually belittling and condescending.  His only real self discovery is when he turns to self help and psychics so he can talk about how wonderful he is and how misunderstood he is.  For all his money and experiences he could have had the same attitude anywhere, one of ego centered self indulgences.  Nice try but highly frustrating and diary-ish.  He should have kept this one to himself 
 This is the most boring book I've read in the series! I've read all her books and I couldn't wait to finish this one. I can't believe I finished it in the first place! It has no plot and you can tell who did it very early in the storyline (if you want to call it a storyline). I wouldn't waste money buying this one. Get it from your library! The rumors about this one being ghostwritten have got to be true. I can't imagine Braun writing like this! 
 Having enjoyed other Ripley stories, I found all the cental characters in the book unlikeley, and discriptions of Ripley and his relationships irritating and was glad to finish the book, by skimming the pages towards the finish.  
 I purchased 2 Rite Lites to use under my kitchen cabinets.  The light output was not strong enough to assist in food prep or even read a recipe. Additionally, the batteries were drained very quickly so I would have to be replacing batteries all the time.  I called the company to see if I could return them and was told no if I didn't have the original packaging -- even though I had the invoice.  I was very disappointed to have $32.00 worth of merchandise that I couldn't use or return 
 If this is a re-issue of their 1994 debut album "Life", then can someone tell me why "Carnival" wasn't included?  I love the Cardigans, but for some strange reason their biggest hit in Europe was not included in this CD.  For that reason alone, I defintely do not recommned this album and I urge people instead to purchase "Life".  I give it 1 star because it is utterly perplexing why "Carnival" wasn't included.  
 It's really sort of a trip back in time reading this book...so much of it probably worked pretty well in 1985 when this was written but the translation in 2004 doesn't quite make it. Trendy young Dr. Delaware, age 33, drives a Cadillac Seville and when it's disabled he rents a "boxy Japanese car". Lot's of amusing things crop up like that in this book which actually made me sort of nostalgic. I had to go listen to old Hall & Oates LP's to re-visit "Say It Isn't So" and "Maneater" again! It also has a central convention of the 80's that I'm currently sick to death of...struggling,impoverished minorities-Good Guys, White, affluent successful Christian Men who conspire-Bad Guys. Honestly, this formula is more stereotypical than "The Butler Did It" used to be. If you spot a successful white guy early in a story, especially if it's suggested that he's a Christian, he's probably the bad guy. If Kellerman wrote this book in 2004 it probably couldn't get published...it's way too formulaic! Consequenly a big part of my dislike of this book is because of this. It doesn't stop there however...many reviews here suggest that Jonathan Kellerman is a great writer. I think he's marginal at best. I think these characters are really pretty shallow and the whole idea of this psychologist single handedly solving crimes and beating up bad guys twice his size is goofy. Delaware points a gun at central villians on 2 separate occasions in the story and they admit to everything but their shoe size. Try to imagine Patrick Kenzie or Harry Bosch pointing a gun at a bad guy and having said bad guy collapse and outline every last element of the crime in great detail. It reminded me of those old Perry Mason shows where Perry always seems to get a witness to break down in open court and admit to his or her crime in front of a packed court room. Here's a suggestion: if you want to read a good mystery with child abuse as a theme read Dennis Lehane's "Gone Baby, Gone". Jonathan Kellerman should be writing scripts for TV detective shows...like Barnaby Jone 
      A film to watch before going to bed.  Nothing extraordinary in the story or performances of actors.  Just Ok! to relax a little 
 Man, I don't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking, but it should be illegal!  This is, first off, a terrible DVD: 4:3 (full screen) format, with a dark, muddy picture.  Worse, the plot is typical, predictable, and poorly written.  Other than looking for glimpses of Teri Hatcher's body, sitting through this fiasco is a total bore.  I was also surprised at how bad Teri's acting was in this movie, since I've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this.  That is probably the fault of the director, Erik Anjou, a third-rate director (at best!) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary.  Gee, I wonder why he isn't in more demand (NOT!)!  I can enjoy "B" movies, and bad movies, but this one is just so totally non-involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at.  I can't imagine that this mess was released on DVD for any reason other than to cash in on Teri Hatcher's current popularity, and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger (29 year-old) Teri Hatcher nude.    Rent this, if you must, but, wow, there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad 
 OK, i'll be first to admit that it's handy to have the book around while i'm playing.  having said that, prima really should've done their homework before putting out this "new and revised" edition.  Or at least put out free addendums on the net somewhere!  If you buy the book, remember that websites like the herald exist that are far more up to date and accurate than this book could ever be.  Spell line info especially.  DO NOT rely on this book for planning your character spec!! 
 Indians, Pakistanis, English right-wing thugs, academics, swingers, religious zealeots, idealists, pushers and the hopeless meet in London, but do little to create much excitement.  A young Pakistini student moves to the big city after the death of his father and deals with himself, his sexuality, relgious beliefs, his family's bollywood-like dramas and his neighbour's idealists (mis)adventures.   To rate this book on the strength of the images it conjures up for those who lived in London during that era, might not be the fairest way to judge a book. Apart from the protagonst's unconvincing affair with his lecturer and run-ins with his brother, there is little else to grab the attention of the reader.  A slow and tedious read and had i not picked this up for only US$2, the rating would be easily one star 
 I bought this hoping for wise advice on financial matters. I instead found this book to be 200 pages of talk without substance. The points it makes (dont retire, quit work, die broke) are remade over and over in different ways without much of any intelligent argument as to why or how. I felt the book was not worth a read at all and was just a bunch of fluff to make up 200 pages. It was poorly organized as well with different subjects per each chapter. For example chap. 8 is "Accountants" through chapter 46 is a one page chapter on "Savings Accounts." I couldnt believe how many words were used that never said anything. Blah 
 I find this book unreadable. I read the first half and scanned the rest. I found it rather like a joke played on the reader rather than a novel. If this was a parody of style, it would work better if the reader was very  familiar with the styles being parodied. I felt betrayed for having bought  it. No character, if any could be called that, appeared to be remotely  likeable 
 When I bought this book I thought I was buying a book that would help me teach my parrot to talk. Although I do know that there are no guarantees about which bird will talk and what method works, I wanted tips and advice on how to help my parrot learn.   This books gives no such information. It covers why parrots talk, which parrots talk and lots of stories about talking parrots, but no real information on teaching my bird to talk. The only chapter I liked was the one about the Model/Rival-method, which is a detailed chapter on teaching a parrot to talk with cognition, understanding the words it uses. However, the bird must alredy be talking for this method to work.  What I wanted was an answer to these questions: Do constant, out of context, repetitions work? Does plaing a casette work? Would it help to have talking sessions? Does my tone of voice matter? How can I get my bird to talk more clearly? How can I get my bird to talk in front of strangers 
 It is a wonder this book sells even now when lot of better books have gone out of print. Then, life is full of such surprises 
 There isn't much of a blend, its just I think plain too spicy for a normal taste bud..extremely hot for those of you who like it!  I like hot stuff, but this is just too...hot 
 Despite significant effort on my part I could not finish this novel - it was just too boring.  Chapter after chapter went by and nothing caught the attention of my imagination.  Flat characters, tedious scene descriptions, flaccid style -- I can't imagine how Hamilton has earned a reputation as a good writer.  There are too many excellent mysteries on the market to waste time with this mediocrity.  I give it an F.  
 I bought this book expecting it to be as wonderful as French Chic by fashion writer Suzanne Somer (unfortunately out of print) or A Year of Style by Frederic Fekkai.  Unfortunately, this book is filled with dated clothing and very little substance to explain the French fashion mystique.  However, there are two other great books that are keepers.  The first is Frederic Fekkai: A Year of Style.  The famous French stylist does an excellent job of showing you how to be beautiful with easy and simple ideas to use throughout the year. The second book is A Guide to Elegance: For Every Woman Who Wants to Be Well and Properly Dressed on All Occasions by Geneviere Antonine Dariaux.  Madame Genevieve Antoine Dariaux, former directrice for Nina Ricci shares her extensive expertise on creating the classic French look 
 I bought this book based on the reviews that I read here and was very disappointed with it.  Coconut oil may be a good idea but the sketchy research in this book didn't convince me.  The recipes sound good but have many fancy, hard-to-find ingredients and are just too time-consuming to be practical.  I have only used one recipe from the book, as I found all the others to be impractical. Take the Thai Chicken Soup for example:  It has 16 different ingredients, 10 of which have to be chopped, sliced or bruised and many of which would be difficult to find and/or expensive such as lemongrass, galanga root, Thai fish sauce and Kaffir lime leaves.  Most regular grocery stores wouldn't even carry all those items.    The Phase I of the diet is a 21-Day Weight Loss Kickoff which consists of three meals per day and two snacks.  Some examples of the snacks are:   herbal tea and 6 macadamia nuts (no joke, thats all you get for that mid-morning snack) 12 raw or toasted almonds  1 celery stalk stuffed with goat cheese 3-4 sardines packed in mustard sauce  6 pecan halves  3 radishes and 4 green olives These are all individual snacks, not combined! If you normally eat like a bird, this might work for you but if you normally have a real snack, 6 macadamia nuts with sparkling water.  Phase II is a section on cleansing: first colon cleansing, then liver cleansing, gallbladder cleansing and finally kidney cleansing.  You may as well forget this phase if you don't have a juicer and all day to devote to the schedule.  For example for liver cleansing you would start your day like this: 7:00 or upon rising, drink 1 cup hot water with the juice of 1/4 lemon and a dash of cayenne pepper.  7:15 Beet juice cocktail (juice cucumber, carrots, a beet with greens, celery, ginger root and lemon).  8:00  any breakfast suggestion from the breakfast recipes and include raw food  take 1-2 capsules of the herb milk thistle or liver cleansing herbs  9:00 1-2 teaspoons Beet Salad (recipe on page 226)  10:30 ginger or echinacea tea  11:00 1-2 teaspons Beet Salad.  Sound like a lot of work?  And you are only up to 11:00!  It continues until 8:30 p.m.  Phase III is Introducing Healthy Carbs where you get to add a few more carbohydrates.  The meals are still a lot of work and the snacks are still tiny (you can have 6-10 macadamia nuts!)  Phase IV is Maintaining Your Healthy Weight.  More of the same but who could stick with it that long anyway?  Unless you love to spend the whole day in the kitchen and have a lot of time and money and have nothing better to do, you won't like this program.  Coconut oil may be worth a try but this book really isn't.  I like to eat healthy but this plan is rediculous 
 God was a man. His name was Jesus Christ. Learn about Him if you want to Learn about God. True, he's not going to make you feel better about yourself without challenging you to change, as most new age philsophers will. But he'll bring you to God. No one else can. no one 
 This is one of the worst books I've ever seen.  It is very depressing.  It does not show an accurate description of the last 100 years.  It shows all the war and killing and negative side of everything.  I do not recommend this book to anyone.  The pictures are gross!!  Please do not show this book to children unless you want them to think everything is terrible.  I usually love books like this but was very upset by this book 
 I was excited about getting a cute timer that worked with the decor of my kitchen.  Unfortunately, the timer never worked on the product!  Now I am sad 
 So we just got this gift for Christmas for our 8 year old. Took me almost 10 minutes to get it to "lick." The review that mentioned rubbing hard helped. I shouldn't have to come to the reviews to figure that out. Once I got it to lick once I'm 5 minutes into trying to get it to do it again. Just WAY to much work. Not looking forward to Christmas morning and my 8 year old's almost assured disappointment 
 With Novella, Renaissance were showing signs of wear. The old formula was still working well for them, but it was obvious that it wasn't working nearly as well as it had on the albums that preceded it, especially their high-water mark "Scheherezade And Other Stories." Sales were down, and something had to change, and fast.     It was becoming apparent that they weren't having a tremendous amount of commercial success, so they simplified their approach, used more synthesizers, and in what had to have been a crazed descision thinking that their fans would want a little variety and not hear Annie on a couple songs, they let Jon Camp sing a couple tunes.     For Renaissance, writing pop songs should not have been hard. The hearts of all of their epic pieces were basic, lovely pop songs with catchy, memorable vocal hooks. In short, songs that stick with you.    Unfortunately, part of the fat-trimming process of this album meant not only losing a lot of outside orchestration and instrumental complexity, but the memorable vocal melodies as well. Songs such as "Closer Than Yesterday" and "Back Home Once Again" have pleasant, enjoyable melodies. Despite this, they unfortunately go in one ear and out the other, lacking the coveted "hook" that will give you that magic hit. These are songs I've heard multiple times that I can't seem to remember much of as far as lyrics. "Kindness," the one tolerable Camp-sung tune on the album, once again has a nice structure musically but sticks with you like a small salad. Luckily, they hit it big time with "Northern Lights" which is without a doubt the best pop song the band ever wrote and coincidentally, gave them their first hit. Unlike the other songs on here, this one is near impossible to get out of your head once it's stuck there.     As far as the epics which bookend the album, the title track is one of their best. It has a great, driving instrumental opening and is one of their most bombastic and glorious tunes. I wish I could say the same for the "Opening Out/Day Of The Dreamer" suite, which are 2 tunes that should have been one. Neither one sounds like a fully developed song. Right when "Opening Out" sounds like it might take off somewhere, it totally dies on you. It hits you with a punch in the beginning and whimpily just kind of dies off. Melodies in this song are reprised generously in "Day Of The Dreamer" and I still can't figure out why. Maybe they couldn't come up with enough material to finish it? Who knows. Regardless, the first half of "Dreamer" is just fantastic, one of the most lighthearted, energetic, and euphoria-inducing sections of music in their catalog sure to send you into uncontrollable fits of joy. Unfortunately, this half of the suite suffers the same fate as the first half, and a little over halfway through you will be wishing it was over. Towards the end, they reprise the chorus of the first half of the song in a key that's way too low for Annie to deliver powerfully, which totaly kills any momentum the song was building up to that point (which wasn't much, but out of the dreary, slow middle section something really powerful would have been nice here.) In the end, it is just frustrating that they wasted so many marvelous sections of music on such a pointless, rambling mini-suite.     As far as "She Is Love," it is one of the ultimate low points of the Renaissance catalog and disgustingly sung by John Camp. It is almost as bad as the proceding Camp-sung track "Only Angels Have Wings" on Azure D'Or but not nearly as wretched as "Auto-Tech" from the Time Line album.    All in all, a lot of stuff on here is pleasant enough to listen to, yet it struggles to hold your attention and comes across as unfocused and messy. It doesn't hold well together as an album, the better individual songs would fare much better on a homemade compilation disc. They would get the pop songwriting down a lot better on the next album, Azure D'Or (which has a handful of my favorite Renaissance tracks) yet their abilities to create complex music would wane even further. The beginning of the end for one of the great 70's prog acts. A recovery was never made.   
 With the X-Men feature films and the hit Ultimate X-Men comic opening the world of X-Men to new fans, X-Men: Evolution takes the established characters fans have loved for years (Cyclops, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, Rogue, Shadowcat) and puts them as high school students living at Professor Xavier's mansion with Wolverine and Storm as grown up instructors, and a new character named Spyke is introduced as well (whose powers are distinctly similar to that of Marrow, a former X-Men member in the comics).  Many longtime fans didn't find the series too likeable because of the way it is presented, and X-Men: Evolution doesn't hold a candle to the early 90's Fox show.  Nightcrawler's characterization is terrible, and there's too much teenie bopper type mellow drama going on with high school kids.  The animation is decent, but it's not as gritty as the Fox series.  The later seasons however, in which beloved characters Gambit and Colossus are introduced (and they do battle with Apocalypse), are much better than the episodes contained on these discs, but all in all I'd stick with the Fox series anyday 
 Seeing the other 5-star reviews makes me wonder, eihter those reviewers are clueless or I might have missed something big. The main idea of the book is that if you can figure out the expectations incorporated in a market price and then evaluate the likelihood that (the more important of) those expectations may be wrong, you may actually find mispriced stocks and thus uncover good investment opportunities. Which I think is a nice idea, but is much easier said than done. The way the authors propose to proceed can be summarized as follows: (i) figure out from publicly available info and analyst reports the main consensus drivers such as sales growth, operating margin, cost of capital, etc., (ii) figure out what forecast period you need for a DCF model based on the consensus assumptions to produce the current market price of the stock, (iii)evaluate if any/which of the assumptions used in the DCF model are likely to be wrong, and based on that, (iv)make a buy/sell/hold decision. The reason this approach doesn't seem to add a lot of value to me is that it essentially consists of evaluating the assumptions used by other analysts (or other "consensus" numbers) to see if they make sense. This is what a lot of investors are already doing, except that it's a notoriously difficult task, and once you've gone through the pain of evaluating the main driving assumptions behind the consensus DCF, you are just a half-step away from building your own DCF anyway. I'm giving the book 2 stars though for the pretty useful frameworks for thinking about drivers in a DCF model, and for being written in a fairly concise and articulate style 
 I am a most ardent fan of Iz, I own every CD and the other DVDs- he is my favorite musician, EVER.  I did not like this DVD. I did not get any sense of the beauty and true Aloha spirit that I have found in his music- it seemed kind of amaturish, and like they had to include every thing any one said just to stretch it out. I wish someone would make a really good biography for him- there was something about him that went way beyond the music and into the heart for a lot of us, and you just could not see that in this attempt. I won't even watch it a second time 
 Uh, I'm not sure I agree a hundred percent with your detective work, there, Greil.   If he truly wanted to present and comprehensive view of what his subtitle purports, that is, American myths archetypes and how they inform and are presented by Rock and Roll, why is the scope of this book so narrow? The artists he focuses on are a motley crew. Elvis, Robert Johnson sure- but Randy Newman? The Band, but not Dylan? Harmonica Frank, but no Chuck Berry? Berry's oeuvre itself is a perfect microcosm of 20th century American Mythos. Speaking of myth, why is Pilgram's Progress invoked as a metaphor for The Band, but Faust isn't referenced at all in the Robert Johnson chapter. America is nothing if not Faustian. This book is 40 percent Rock-Geek trivia, and 60 percent pure ponderous speculation. Marcus occasionally drifts into a fugue and wanders far away from his (musical) subject, several times in the Elvis section whereupon he suddenly remembers what he was supposed to be writing about and tries vainly to shoehorn all of his speculations together. I think Marcus is a fine writer (we would not entertain his notions for a second if he wasn't), and this book certainly has its moments, but on the whole it does not nearly live up to its hype. He has done better, in The Old, Weird America, dealing with the same themes and sticking to one musical subject (Dylan's Basement Tapes). 
 My friend who lives in Rome suggested this book. I generally avoid Dan Brown, and sort of wish I had avoided this book.  His research was great, if you can believe all of his information, and the well described locations all over Rome were marvelous, but ........   Two, not one but TWO, men fall out of a helicopter very high above Rome and land unharmed?  Many other plot devises were quite difficult to digest.  Plus, Brown seems to have a personal vendetta for the Catholic Church.  God certainly knows a lot of evil has been done in the name of religion and the church probsably leads the pack, but Brown's problem seems rather personal.  Maybe he was abused by a priest 
 This game is ok, entertains my children for a little while.  I thought everything was ok, but then, after only a couple of months, the cartridges started to malfunction!  We have two leap pads and some games work in one, but not the other (and visa versa!)  For the price, I don't want the toy to not work 1/2 the time after only a few uses.  The books seem to hold up pretty good, but the cartridges don't.  And, at a price of around $12 each, I was very dissapointed.  If the cartridges worked all the time, I would probably give this toy 4 stars, as it is fun (when it works) and portable.  One last comment for improvement, would be to have the volume be on the outside, not in the book, as the regular volume is a bit too loud and I have to ask my little one to turn it down each time she switches books/cartridges 
 Hammerfall gives us a somewhat disappointing album "Crimson Thunder". So, how does this release measure up? Well, I have to say once again I am slightly disappointed. I don't think they have quite the same punch in their sound as on their debut which just rocked from beginning to end. Musically the band clearly has a lot to offer, sharp raw riffs, melodic solo's, powerful and intense drums, a hard and pumping bass that gives a lot of depth to the songs, and the best Hammerfall vocal performance yet, very melodic. There are a couple of interesting tracks here that are worth extra listens, the epic "Angel Of Mercy" and the stately, progressive metal like 'In Memoriam.' But, these come more than halfway through the album, that later being the second to last track. Personally, my favorite track is 'Hearts on Fire,' with it's catchy chourse when every member in the band shouts the chourse "Hearts on fire, hearts on fire, burning burning with desire," adding its own charging into battle-like theme, which can give you an image of all the Templars chanting as they charge into the battle. Over all, this isn't a great Hammerfall album, but it does have a few listenable songs in it, but I would only recommend this if you are a true Templar 
 I was required to buy this book for a first year MBA course, and i found myself unable to stay awake for more than one page at a time.  Not so much the author but the subject matter is enough to make one comatosed 
 This is a literal translation without any soul. Olivelle doesn't have the heart at the right place to translate mystical writings of the Upanishads. He should stick to Jesuit material 
 if you want the evil truth about Dr K and how he undermined the 1968 peace talks, read "No Peace, No Honor: Nixon, Kissinger, and Betrayal in Vietnam" by Larry Berman.  This book explains how Nixon and Kissinger illegally colluded with SVN and Nguyen Van Thieu - he was told by Nixon via Anna Chenault to "hold on, we are going to win" and "you will get a better deal with us". So Thieu says he won't talk peace, Nixon wins, Kissinger openly changes sides after working with the Democrats, and together they crank up the war.  The point is: The War could have ended in 1968 if it were not for this man - Dr Death himself, Henry Adolf Kissinger 
 No matter how I much I mess with this, I can never get it to pick up enough sound.  I have to basically hold it in my mouth to get decent volume level, and trying to share it between two people is basically impossible.  The hardware seems pretty decent, and I can't really whine about the price, but this thing is less useful than the built-in mic on my mp3 player 
 I am writing this review, because people are erroneously using this book as a source for research into pre-modern Japan. It should not be used for this purpose. It belongs to a genre which I call "gosh golly" books. I will proceed to comments relating to previous reviews.  1. The illustrations are modern and appear to have been drawn by a western artist. What it does not contain is reproductions of premodern woodblock prints, paintings, &c. or photographs of actual artifacts.  2. While it has a large bibliography, the works are pretty much exclusively in English and appear to be popular rather than scholarly publications.  3. This book contains descriptions of Japanese "martial arts" such as "tessenjutsu" which do not appear in reliable Japanese literature.  4. This book contains descriptions of highly improbable "martial arts" such as the supposed ability for a seated practitioner to kill an armed opponent by shouting at him.  5. The historical descriptions in the book betray a woeful ignorance. For example, chapter 1 includes a claim that Buddhism is "monotheistic". This makes me wonder how the authors managed to use the correct Japanese words for the military class and the court nobility. Saddly, the scattering of accurate information in this book makes it even less desireable as it lends credance to the book's fantasy elements.   6. One commentor recommended the books by Stephen Turnbull. If you are interested in more scholarly treatments of Japan's medieval period, I recommend consulting books by Marius B. Jansen, Paul Varley, John Witney Hall, William Wayne Farris, and Jeffrey P. Mass. Heavenly Warriors by Farris specifically deals with the origin of the buke class going beyond earlier work by Mass.   7. If what you are looking for is battle paintings, pictures of military artifacts, &c. then you should cosider ordering books from the Mook Series published by Gakken. These can be ordered online from amazon.co.jp. A representative title in this series can be found by entering the following ISBN number into their search engine: 4056042489.  In short. If you are seriously interested in Japan, please buy better books 
 My ex was an avid radiohead fan. It was all she ever listened too. I found an appreciation for her some of other tastes in music, books, and other things in gerneral. She told me to get this album and start listening. She claimed that Radiohead were musical geniuses. So I got this along with the bends. and now I am glad I don't associate myself with her or this so called "musical genius" I just cant understand how people believe this music to be so great. I often find it boring meaningless and going nowhere. I can admire that Radiohead can play more than one instruments and no doubt very talented. This stuff is just boring, weird and depressing 
 AKA 'Code.'  Not to be confused with another 'Hide and Seek' (2005) starring Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning.  This is a Canadian straight-to-video psycho-thriller, and stars Daryl Hannah, Jennifer Tilly, Vincent Gallo, and Bruce Greenwood.  The director is Canadian B-film master Sidney J. Furie.  I don't know how you feel hearing his name, but I believe he is more talented than some people would think, and with decent budget and script, he could have done better films, far better than, say, under-financed 'Superman IV.'  The film is about a pregnant woman played by Hannah suddenly kidnapped by thick-bearded Gallo.  Gallo, it turns out later, does this for his 'baby' Tilly, and locks Hannah up in the dark basement room of his house, and chains her to the bed, nad fakes her death to cover his crime.  Greenwood is Hannah's hubby who seeks for his missing wife.  So 'Hide and Seek'?  A suspence, huh?  Yeah, it sounds like 'Misery' or 'The Collector,' but probably before you feel any thrills, you will be either immensely entertained by or absolutely disgusted with Jennifer Tilly's over-the-top acting.  I regret that my poor English cannot fully express the joy of watching campy acting from her, but let me only say that her constant yellings, ultra-heavy make-ups, silly dialogues are hilarious enough to outshine ten Sharons and Halles in the wretched 'Catwoman.'  I'm not blaming her for giving poor acting.  It's like watching the younger version of Kathy Bates (who was Oscar nominated for 'Misery' you know that), and the more I watch her, the more I admire her.    As to Gallo, no comment is the kindest comment I can make, and as to Daryl Hannah, probably she has already had this entry erased from her CV circulated among the studios.  I can hear her say, Thank you Quentin Tarantino, you saved my life.  At times the film is very nasty (how can you call it entertainment when you have to see a kidnapped pregnant woman forced to eat through a tube strapped to her mouth?), and its story is never convincing (why kidnap a pregnant woman, not a baby?), and most of all, hey, Ms. Hannah played a replicant in 'Bladerunner' who nearly killed Harrison Ford!  Can you kidnap her?  No kidding!  So two stars are the best I can give to this film, both for Ms. Tilly for giving one of the most bizarre acting that I have ever seen.  I really like her, but for once, please, someone give her something different.        
 This book is terrible! You read through the whole thing, and you don't even learn anything!  I would strongly recommend people not to buy this book.   Otherwise, you just wasted 30 dollars on worthless bs. 
 If anyone is actually looking for a true tale of the plight of California Indians, don't bother to look at Jackson's novel.  It is inherently racist, written by a woman who doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same likes as Upton Sinclair or Harriet Beecher Stowe.  On one of her visits to California, Jackson called the Native Americans she saw "loathsome, abject and hideous." In her novel, she doesn't stray far from this inherent indignation of another race. In fact, she most likely had no idea she was being racist, another reason entirely why this book should be burned. ALternately thorughout the book, Jackson refers to the indians Ramona and ALlesandro encounter as "patient creatures" (16), "poor creatures" (20), "wild creatures" (47), "faithful creatures" (353),  "miserable creatures" (324), "vagabond bands" (286) "like beasts" without the Christianizing presence of the Missions (231). are they human? possibly. are they equal to the pastoral spanish who enslaved them that Jackson venerates so much? most definitely not.  Secondly, ALlesandro could be the most anglicized Indian ever. He is most assurredly an abberation, physically looked like a mexican, was the most devout catholic, lives in a house that is like any mexican villa. INdeed, Jackson remarks that "There were not many such Indians as Allesandro and his Father. If there had been, it would have been better for their people," (327) and that he "almost makes one forget he is an Indian." (101).  also, she refuses to create an interracial love story. the whole crappy book is predicated on the fact that Ramona is half indian. only when she is indian can she fulfill Jackson's debased notion of racial determinism.  Besides the myriad moral reasons why this book is so terrible, it could be the most groandiose, verbose, and pooorly written romance book EVER. the characters lack any moral ambiguity which would make for interesting characterization and are constantly marked by sweeping romantic gestures that could better be classified as trash fiction than a literary classic.   You'd find more entertainment from reading the yellow pages than wasting your time. The world would be a better place if the trees from which the paper for this book came from were still planted.  
 I expected arguments, analysis and reasoning between the vision of God from the religious point of view constrasted with the vision of God from scientists.   Instead of this, I found the biographies of Einstein, Hubble, and other scientists. And the main subject, the reason of the book is found in the last chapter. If you want to read the book in a flash, just read last parragraph on page 138. That's it. Deceiving 
 This book was horrible, one: because these books don't interest me at all, and two: why does there have to be a whole novel on this topic when there cold just be a summary sheet. Basically this book is just not my cup of TEA..hahh 
 This book isn't witty, funny, amusing or enlightening. It's sick and sad. Don't buy it. 
 this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good. i've read all iles' complicated yet fasinating novels, most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed. but this 24 hours didn't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes' over 24 minutes, i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again. the other books such as the quiet game, sleep no more, blood memory, dead sleep are all great reading experiences, his first and second ones were just too jewish focused. concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles, although after hurricane katrina, the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right, not as good as what iles described in his novels. all said, this time no cigar for you, poncho 
 If you want to study internet advertising history,this is a great book.Other than that,it is a complete waste of time,effort and money.I am surprised that you can still see and buy this outdated book on the  bookstore shelf 
 I missed this last tour and looked forward to seeing it on DVD.  What I did see were shot after shot of the crowd.  How many did I need to see of the crowd singing along?  How many celebrities did I need to see?  It was like Paul saying, "See how many people love me."  Your an ex-Beatle and the surviving half of the greatest songwriting team in music history, it's okay, we all love you.  The three generational family attending and meeting Paul saga was a 10 on the douche chills meter.  When I go to a concert I'm looking at the stage not at the people around me.  Keep the crowd shots to in-between songs.  At various points in this DVD the talking heads say how important the audiences are to the show.  This is not a Deadhead crowd.  There is no need to average over 20 audeince shots per song (and that's with some songs running only a couple of minutes)!!  The The highlight of the DVD is in the Extras.  Save your money and buy one of the many other Paul concert DVDs that are out there 
 Someone pointed out in another review that the songs are presented in the original mono versions.  More than that, I also have the Chartbusters (12 cds) Mowtown compilation and in addition some old vinyl recordings, and I have noticed that the actual _mixes_ are not even the same as the original recordings.  For instance, on Stevie Wonder's "For Once In My Life" and Glady Knight and the Pips' "I Heard It Through The Grapevine" there are parts that are just plain missing.  I'm very disappointed, as my favorite songs do not sound at all as I remember them. Update:  I listened again.  I think I might have been mistaken when I said that parts were just plain missing.  I think it's just that the mono versions actually bury things that come across more clearly in the stereo versions.  It just a shame that the original record company couldn't have done a better job in light of the advent of the CD 
 right off the bat, JJ runs into an indian in the middle of nowhere, the indian has is gun JJ doesnt, oh boy the tension fills the air, no wait, for the FIRST TIME EVER, the indian turns and rides away, does NOT kill the white man, who is all alone on the Indians land, trying to catch HIS fish.     liberal revisionist trying to make the indian look like he is better than the white man, and oh smarter also, for just after that, JJ is trying to get a fire going "but" does this under a tree that has snow all over it, he gets the fire going and oh darn!  snow fell on it!  dumb white man!    If this movie didnt have superstar Robert Redford in it, would of been just another dumb movie, like that idiot Timmy that made Grizzly Man.     An Indian that lets a white man live all out in the middle of nowhere, LOL!  yes the white man stole the land, yes the white man did this that and everything else to the indians.   But its not like they were angels, they fought with each other just like the rest of the world has always done throught history.   to deny that, is just plain stupid.   The 1970's, marks the turning point the liberals took over Hollyweird.  Clint Eastwood never would of made this move in the 1960's, or ever.     
 I'm afraid this book missed the mark for me, which is a pity because it is very nearly a good book.  The photo.s are generally good which was the books redeeming quality.  (For me) The text lets the book down terribly.  The Author may be a Doctor, and I can respect that.  However, either write it in clinical vernacular as a Doctor (as per Masters and Johnston or Kinsley) or write it at eye level with the reader as a peer and equal, as another sexual being.  If you want to understand what I mean check out the styles of Authors such as Jen Sincero (The Straight Girl's Guide to Sleeping with Chicks), Toni Bentley (The Surrender) and Zoe Schramm-Evans (Making Out).  These may be more specifically targeted than SexPerfect to minority interests but an adult can comfortably read them.  An equivalent book in many ways to SexPerfect is `The Essential Kama-Sutra' by the Erotice Print Society in London.  In `The Essential Kama-Sutra' the couple look to be celebrating Life, Love and Sex.  They are introduced to the reader by name, history and relationship and give a participant's feedback to the different techniques, sex positions etc.  It's smiles and laughter and fun so it doesn't try to reinforce the dysfunctional and sick fallacy that sex is a serious business.  SexPerfect made me feel like a pygmy in the Jungle being spoken down to by a bombastic, condescending missionary who'd come to convert me and felt he knew better about everything in my world than I did. My partners who looked over it were struck with the same feeling.  The three `Crunchers' for me were:- 1.	` ....a game young woman is urging on her muscular lover with the aid of........'  re a lightweight spanking type photo. `-muscular lover'??  Are we writing to add value to people's intimate world?, an erotic novel?, a porno script? Or what? 2.	Kiddie talk.  Sorry-this aspect of this book made me feel downright dirty!  If it's a clinical paper it's someone's anus, if it's a `one-to-one' manuscript it's a lot of other more adult names but stuff like "If someone's going to put a finger inside your bottom it's wise to pop off to the loo first' sound so much like someone talking to an eight year old on school camp it's almost disturbing. Finally- 3.	`The Delvin manoeuvre'!! Sorry buddy-I think you need to get out a bit more often!!  The Author's describing something I've always done with my partners.  I hope his ego can adjust but even if the visuals in my head gross me out a bit I reckon my Grandpa probably used to do it to my Grandma too.  Maybe I'll give it a name too-I'll call it the `My Grandpa manoeuvre'.  I know it seems I've given this poor bloke a right proper sledging here but, notwithstanding, if you can borrow a copy of SexPerfect or pick one up very cheap, consider having a look at it.  The Author obviously meant well and I'll support anything that brings people closer to the bliss and sexual ecstasy we all deserve.  I'm also big enough to accept all of what's right or wrong for me doesn't necessarily apply to everyone else.  For me-The aforementioned `The Essential Kama-Sutra' is Shakespeare next to a tabloid here but, if the opportunity presents itself have a look at SexPerfect anyway.  Not real flash would be my summary but it might be just right for you and I'll applaud anyone and anything that brings anyone closer to reaching their full potential and pleasure but this one didn't do it for me.  Cheers. Lloyd 
 this album was pathetic. eminem's first 3 albums were classics. this album, eminem doesn't know what to rap about. 
 I found this book to be bland in the least.  It seemed to drag on forever, then when it finally did end it was so abrupt that you felt like the ending was an afterthought.  Not impressed at all 
 Slow, unconvincing, self-congratulatory, not recommended. There. All my thoughts on this book in five words 
 I like Kim Richey a lot.  This collection is not representative of her spunk and unique character.  The arrangements are boring and the lyrics uninspiring.  Pass over this one.  Just about any of her other albums are better than this one 
 When my son was in a convertible car seat which was tilted back slightly and had head/side wings, this pillow worked well.  It was propped well enough to support my son's head when he took a nap.  But when we had to switch him to a straight-back booster seat that had shallow head wings, this pillow was not usable at all 
 Being desperate for ideas as to what to make my 13 year old son who is on a Candida Diet, I thought I had found a gold mine on discovering this book. I was disappointed, however, when I checked with my naturopath regarding  the safety of vegetable glycerin, and was told that it could cause diarrhea  and/or dehydration, and he suggested that I look for an alternative  sweetener.  I have had some success using Ms. Burton's recipes substituting  stevia.  But thanks for trying, Ms. Burton, for so many of us this is a  recurring problem 
 Sufficient movie to waist a couple hours downtime here in Afghanistan. That's it though 
 This is a beautiful board in theory.  I like the concept of the angel markers in various colors, along with the crystal dice.  Therein lies the problem. I don't see where tiny dots on a pair of dice can ever correspond to an honest answer, unless of course one knows how to divine with dice.  Divination with dice should be the ultimate objective of Angel Guidance, with a transition to oracle cards or some such for additional clarification if need be.  Unfortunately, this board is not designed this way.  This board fails the moment the holder of the dice is meant to use the number of dots to move the marker several paces up a chart of words and phrases.  Divination then becomes a game, and that game is not always fun.  The answers do not always fit the questions.  It can be like forcing a square peg into a round hole.  Some answers may be too general or too sugar coated.  The holder of the dice may have additional questions, or may find the need to problem solve.  The author has left no room for any additional clarification on issues that may arise after a marker lands on any word or phrase.  Unlike tarot, there are no symbols or pictures to interpret.  It's just simple words that fall flat.  The provided guide book is of little help either.  Yikes!  I will give this two stars, only because I like the crystal dice.  My advice?  Learn how to divine with dice and go from there.  Toss out the so called board.  It's crap 
 My infant daughter got her arms free in about 60 seconds.  It is not a well designed blanket 
 Initally, I felt cheated, slighted, and disturbed that someone got away with releasing a CD of this exceptionally poor quality--and featuring the works of such a brilliant composer, to boot. The fact that whoever created this is trying to pass off this MIDI garbage as symphonic works. The quality is for the most part not even up to par with the tracks from the games (Liberi Fatali is exceptionally bad.)[...] This guy, whoever he is, is responsible for equally poor arrangements of otherwise great soundtracks (and apparently classical works as well) and to be completely honest, I don't think any of them deserved to be dragged through the mud like this.  Sherman Records has produced poor quality CDs and maintains a poor quality website that attempts to pass off its own sorry synthesised work as the authentic music of a real-life Symphony Orchestra.  The MajesticMix track is actually half decent. My sympathies to the creators of that track for appearing on such an otherwise laughable attempt at a "soundtrack" release 
 Esquire is a subpar Men's magazine, in my opinon.  More than half of the magazine is advertisements, and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and/or thought-provoking.  If you like ads and cologne samples, pick it up.  After all, it is pretty decently priced 
 This book seemed to focus a lot on how beneficial it would be to order the course(s)by the author(s). It was ok 
 This book is an interesting collection of chapters, interviews and ideas by Drucker.  There are a handful of good ideas, but as a whole, the book is disjointed and no clear point or argument is raised.  While it is good fodder for quotes, don't expect to emerge with any great ideas or new perspectives 
 Ummm... yeah this movie sucked. I mean come on, zombie cows? This movie had really bad special effects, even worse acting, and most of all it was just retarted. This lady even took her high heel shoe off and threw it at a zombie and  impaled its head. I know its a zombie movie and its not suppose to be realistic, but a high heel shoe? The only reason that you should rent this is because there is this short movie the director made that also sucks, but in a funny way. So, if you are super bored, go rent it and make fun of it. If you are just looking for a good zombie movie, keep looking. after watching this movie I actually think I've becaome brain dead. 
 This book features an incredibly lame plot and even lamer dialog that is so corny it almost seems like parody. Then there is the obnoxious phrase that two of the main characters say to one another ad nauseum: "But...(dramatic pause, I assume) I saw you die!" I wish they had seen ME die so I wouldn't have had to finish reading this idiotic book. Take out this phrase and the 500 page book would probably be reduced to 450 pages. This was the first - and last - David Morrell book I will read 
 I read this book for a lass I was taking. I'd say read it if you want a bunch of short life storys of how "normal" women made big money. I am a guy and had a hard time relating so my feeling is that most guys will because the book dosn't sympathize for them. Oh well, you can't always win. Better luck next time. Read Fast Food Nation, it will change your life 
 In "Iron John," Robert Bly announces that American men are all unhappy because the pressures of civilization have caused them to lose touch with their innate maleness.  He illustrates his point with one of the Brothers Grimm's more obscure (and frankly less interesting) stories, interpreting it as an allegory that just happens to prove his point.  He also draws heavily on Freudian and Jungian theories.  He proves his point in the same way Freud and Jung proved theirs' i.e. by saying "This is what I see, I am the expert, so that makes it true, Occham's Razor be darned."  Bly offers no objective evidence to support his positions, nor does he allow room for the possibility of other interpretations or, heaven forbid, that his observations might be wrong.  For example, Bly asserts that men become unhappy around the age of 35 (conveniently neglecting to site research supporting this assertion, despite his objective tone).  Bly explains that this is because at that age men begin to realize that their childhood dreams will not come true.  He does not consider that by age 35, most men have realized that they don't really want to be firemen.  Could this alleged unhappiness possibly be due to media influences that require unhappy customers to sell products to (such as self-help books)?  Naw, it's gotta be that "dreams" thing.  Bly also describes a case where students during the Viet Nam war broke into their college presidents' office to look for proof that the college was collaborating with the CIA.  Bly states that this happened because of the mistrust in male authority figures, because their fathers left home to work, preventing their sons from seeing how men work.  Bly does not consider the possibility that the students may have been righteously angry about the war and confused by their anger.  No, there had to be a "real" reason for the break-in, and aren't we lucky to have Robert Bly to tell us what it is?  Along the way, Bly overloads his writing with literary references, all carefully interpreted to suit his purposes.  It's all very pretentious, er uh, interesting, but so what?  I could interpret the same passages to mean something else.  If I lived at the time the passages were written, my interpretation would most likely be very different, despite Bly's insistence that his ideas are timeless and universal.  Bly' obsession with literary images does more than bog his writing down, however.  It underscores what is wrong with his whole premise.  He tries to build up the notion of the tragedy of lost male identity as objective fact, but uses only subjective views (many not his own and possibly taken wildly out of context) to support the idea.  Sorry Bob, you can't have it both ways.  One gets the impression that "Iron John" was cynically written to fill a niche.  Like all self-help books, "Iron John" targets a specific audience, tells them they are not happy, and insists that only by following his directions can they truly be happy.  Bly's target audience is White men who went to college and felt left out of the various political movements.  If you do not need a political movement to define who you are, then "Iron John" is not for you 
 Rather bleak play with a pessimistic storyline.  Mediocre plot, mediocre characterization.  I don't recommed it 
 The favorable reviews written elsewhere in here must be plants by Sony operatives, because my experience, sadly, replicates to the letter those described in the negative reviews.   The machine plays CDs fine, but its recording process is fraught with problems.  The directions are not only inscrutable, from my conversations with Sony tech support (you have to go online to find the telephone number - it's not included in any of the materials, and that tells you something right there) I have learned that the directions are incomplete.  But even with the tips provided by the tech support people, the machine hardly works at all.  A typical problem: after about an hour's worth of recording, it often (but not always) gives you an error message that the medium you are using is somehow inadequate.  It tells you this even when the medium is a brand new Sony CD-R disc, recommended by Sony, with which the machine has had no problem until that moment.  This is fatal to the whole recording process and one hour has gone down the drain.  This happens repeatedly, but not consistently.   Another recurring problem, if you manage to make it through the recording process without any error messages, the last step, "finalization" is also a hit or miss proposition - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Use of this device is an extremely frustrating and time wasting proposition.  Purchase of this product is pure foolishness.  Folks this is just a total lemon, about as crappy as that '79 Mustang I once had, but that's another story...  You have been warned.     
 Its not CDG.  That means it does not display words on CD Graphics machines.  You get a songbok to sing along with the instrumentals.  I did not read the fine print, but marketing something as a Karaoke CD without CD-Graphics today is just misleading. It is an instumental CD with a songbook 
 Has some factual and historical information, but now dated.  Borrow it from the library........ 
 Pauvre Greta...  She is radiant in this disaster of a film; primarily because her love interest is Ramon Navarro - a gay Spanish actor, playing a straight Russian prince. It is very sad, laughable casting - like a gay Ricky Ricardo pretending he is a...I can't think of a Russian, straight counterpart to Clark Gable.  Garbo tries hard. Barrymore tries harder. Adrian tries the hardest. To no avail. AVOID this film at all cost. An interesting plot line, filmed with calamitous results 
 The authors should be ashamed of themselves for playing the race-card against a franchise with the stellar record of minority hires like the Celtics. Five head coaches (including the current one) have been Af.Am., the Celtics were the first to draft a black player, and the first to put on the court an all-black starting five. Yet these "authors" claim the Celtics are racist because the Celtics of the 1980s had an equal number of white and black players when the league was 75% black. It didn't occur to these authors that maybe the Celtics picked up bargain basement talent that was undervalued by the rest of the league becuase the talent was white. Saying that these players were tokens and couldn't play because they were white is like saying that someone who is Af. Am. can't coach because of his race (which they also implied when they denegrated K.C. Jones' coaching). Well the Celtics definitely disproved both of these ideas in 1986 with a 67-15 record (including 40-1 at home) and an NBA title with a black head coach and 8 white players out of 12.  Among the authors' "sources" is Spike Lee, who at the very least is a partisan Knicks fan and at worst a historical revisionist. His only argument is that "the players all look white in a black man's game, so the team must be racist". However, the Knicks have a much worse record of minority hires. And as for the Lakers who struggled to get two white players on the Showtime teams, the only Af. Am. head coach in my recollection was Magic Johnson. Look at the other teams in the league and you would be hard-pressed to find teams who have the record of hiring non-white coaches like the Celtics. And they have the nerve to call the Celtics racist? This piece of anti-Celtics propaganda is not worth the paper on which it's printed 
 Sorry guys, I looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media.  The graphics of the book are truly beautiful.  The recipes however, hmmm,  try again.  I followed a simple recipe for Apple Crisp and got a bad result.  I now go to respected standard cookbooks for my Apple Crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great.  Really people, the recipes are NOT the stuff of greatness.  Graphics? Great. Photography? Great?  Recipes? You have got to be kidding 
 All the characters in this book were shallow, selfish and boring. The writing was good but I could not relate to nor sympathize with any of the characters 
 i didn't think anything could be more of a waste of money than "nogatco rd.", but i was wrong. this sucks. wack beats, boy-band casio melodies, and it's short, which is actually a good thing.  get project polaroid if you want anything in the same vein as the stuff  keith did with kutmasta kurt, which is really the only good stuff he's done.  
 If you are looking for techniques to use to get your lover back this is a horrible book to learn from. It is my opinion that there are only about five pages worth mentioning in this book. The rest of it seems to be filler pages and stories about other couples 
 The mitten was a good book.It was a good wen thefunnest part when mitten blew.It was a good book at the end it was the funnyest part 
 This book was difficult to get through.  The writing felt very, well, written.  Imagine an FBI agent talking for fifteen minutes while apprehending a bad guy.  Imagine this same agent uttering such phrases as "this weapon should evidence your homocidal intent" and other such phony and cacaphonic tripe, and you will only begin to understand how silly this book is.  Baldacci comes across like a librarian in an argyle sweater trying to write tough "zingers" on every page.  He has no idea how real people might talk in dangerous circumstances, so he tries to overcompensate with embarassing results.  I personally blushed or groaned nearly every page at his feminine rage being spewed out in dialogue and descriptions that miss the mark in every conceievable fashion.    Add to this the idiocy of the main character--acting in ways both too stupid and too intelligent to be any real protagonist, and the contrivances of plot needed to milk this meager theme for hundreds of pages, and you see the frustrating experience it is to read the work.  I shall regale you with one more fine example of the action scenes--when Sydney has met with a "deadly" [Baldacci's thesaurus apparently has only two words: deadly and murderous] intruder in her home, Sydney has a weapon trained on him at near-point blank range when he suddenly catapults into a swan dive behind the couch!  "Milliseconds" before she can fire, he launches himself behind the couch.    Is this "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?"  No, just Baldacci sipping cups of cocoa on doilies trying to make up action sequences before returning to his needlepoint 
 I'm a fan of Madonna's and I thought "Ray of Light" was great, even though it was  a sound I wasn't used to hearing much from her. So here comes the single "Music," which was funky and futuristic. After listening to the CD I was so ticked off for wasting my money on it. "Music" isn't exciting at all. Too many bleeps, very little emotion, too many bizarre and lousy lyrics. The only good tracks are "Music" and "Runaway Lover". I held on to this CD for as long as I could because it looked good with my Madonna collection. But eventually it started taking up space and I sold it just to make room for my newer CDs.  Get "Ray of Light," "Erotica," "Bedtime Stories," "Like A Prayer," or her self-titled  album. Get any of her earlier music instead of this. You're not missing anything here 
 If you are a musician or have a good background in music playing, this CD is not recommended for you; period. This CD is played by computer devices, creating an electronic organized pretty sound, topped by a basic guitar playing. Nothing to add except the music can be played and appreciated in an elevator, grocery store or shopping malls. (Have you ever noticed that when someone writes a review and doesn't give 4 or 5 stars, how he or she gets slammed in the votes?)

 Lets begin by analyzing the concept that this book is based upon: " Implementing Diversity". Who cares about diversity? Business is about getting the best people to perform. There is no color. No diversity. Nothing but performance! No performance, no business! It's books like this that give reading a bad name. My only question is how publishers can publish this garbage 
 Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for.  Between the missing features (no voice dial on a $200 phone?!) crippled features (I have to buy ringtones, use their t-zone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already?) and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier.  Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesn't deserve my business 
 I actually read this entire book just to see if/how Beatrice would get what was coming to her. Yes, the book is about incest. The ads and cover I've seen for this book state something like "Murder, Incest, Betrayal" or something like that so it should come as no shock that it is about incest. The thing I didn't like was that about 2/3 of the book seemed to be about nothing but sex. Sex scene after sex scene. I frankly belive it's better to leave it to the imagination. We all know what happens when you have sex. But really it seemed more wrong that Beatrice and her brother acted like a couple in love. It wasn't just the incest that was gross. Gregory's descriptions of other physical things left me queasy at times. After everything, I think what Beatrice did to her husband had to be one of the vilest acts I've ever read. This book was at the most okay and I do not recommend it 
 Here's another classic example of a reason so many people dislike science. How can we expect people to put up with the bad language and lack of motivation and application? Textbooks ought to set an example of good writing. The authors do not pay attention to the reader. They just bundle a few points together and call it a book. There's no desire to rise above the median 
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 Although I am a shooting enthusiast, and I am sure this book has some useful tidbits, it is so painful to read that finding those tidbits may not be worth the effort.  Whether it is the writing tone of the times or just the author's style, I do not know.  
 Life is too short for this sort of thing. I even gave up on this book listening to an unabridged version on tape. I can't even imagine what reading it would be like with its ultra-dense, paragraph-averse style. Who would have thought that authors were this self-indulgent even back in the 30's!  Skip the entire ridiculously undecipherable book and read the chronology and geneaology in the back! Join the ranks of proud low-brows who have other books to read and enjoy!   
 The play goes along very similar lines as that of the shakespear play  measure for measure as both show selfabsorbtion is a paramount factor  though it does seem like a rewrite is does has its own high points  especially Mosca a very funny character 
 i ordered THIRD MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN DVD.....before i ordered this DVD.....was sometime in January 2007 and i paid for top speed delivery.....i received the other DVD in my order but not THIRD MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN DVD.....nothing yet....  can u look into where it is please......i have emailed before but have not received any response...and wont order again from AMAZON\ thank you  Glenda Papa 
 During a $20 Tarot reading at a Spirituality exhibition, the very un-insightful Tarot reader (who told me nothing significant about my future), recommended this book to me. But I did not buy this book on her recommendation, why would I? She was awful. It was my Mother, who is everything new age and spritual (and the reason why I was at the exhibition in the first place), who bought the book and suggested I read it.  There is nothing profound about this book, in fact if i follow just one of this Authors suggestions, such as talking to every stranger that i lock eyes with (because apparently they have a message for me) not only would i not get anything done, but I would probably be dragged off to the nearest hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. A spotlight reviewer gave this book 5 stars as a comedy, good on him, for seeing the brighter side of this book 
 Sorry Troon, but you put a snowman up on this one.  What a big disappointment.  I loved the other Eddie C. books... I always tried to read one as spring approached to get me in the golfing mood.  But this ain't no golf book... and barely and Eddie C. book.  I feel like I was duped.  For others considering this as their next followup to The Green, The Foursome, and Scratch.... don't.   
 I thought I'd give this author's second book a chance even though I found her first one ("Chasing Vermeer") rather disappointing. I like her Hyde Park setting, I like the way she works art into her stories, I like the way the teacher in the book runs her classroom as a place of exploration rather than a lecture hall. So--I thought, thought I--maybe with all these strong elements in place, the author will improve her plotting abilities in her second book.  Alas, no.  The story has so much potential that is never met.  Once again, coincidence and "intuition" play a huge, way too huge, role in the resolution of the storyline. The Scooby-doo type ending (wherein the bumbling adult bad guys are "unmasked" and supernatural events explained at least in part by their stupid criminal plans) is disappointing and unpredictable from the things we've seen earlier in the story.    The pentaminos storyline has grown wearisome, the bibliomancy one of the kids performs using "The Invisible Man" is irritating and irrelevant, the coded messages simplisitc and unintriguing.   The relationship between the three kids is nicely portrayed--their jealousies of one another, and their attempts to reconcile differences and balance individual needs with group needs. I also liked how the kids in the story work for a cause--saving the Robie House--and I found their demonstration in front of the house in which they "destroy" works of art by chopping them up to be the most interesting part of the book, far superior in terms of action and emotional content than any of the so-called mystery elements.  This part of the book is worth reading, and worth having kids read, both because of its philosophies and because it shows how actions by individuals can make a positive difference.  Hope the author's next book moves more in this direction and away from the pseudo-mystical, pseudo-supernatural, pseudo-mystery lines the first two have followed.  
 I sincerely wish that amazon.com allowed 0 stars.  There were too many "eyerolling" moments in this book, not to mention that the copy editor must have been on vacation.  The plot, which involves a voluptuous woman and ex-rock-and-roll star who get married because of the terms of a will and then begin to fall in love, would have been far more believable if the author would have spent time in story development to make us care about the characters.  This does not happen.  Consequently, the characters come off as simply unbelievable and cliche-ish.  Save your money and pass on this book 
 At $15.95, this is an outrageous rip-off!  The impressive-looking cover image looks like a book, but it only an envelope which contains five LEAFLETS!  They look like the attraction-folders one sees around to be picked up for free.  While the maps are clear, the points of interest listed are described in a few words or short sentences.  You'll get abundantly more information with a book of guided walks.  Don't get suckered in to this excessive price 
 I like gangster movies and am from Philly so I gave this movie a chance. What a mistake. The creators painstakingly tried to rip off the Sopranos but wound up with a very weak imitation.  It starts with the horrible theme song. It's obviously trying to sound similar to the A3 song that serves as the Sopranos theme, but is chock full of horrible lyrics and sounds like someone threw a Casio keyboard down the stairs and recorded it.  The cast is filled mediocre actors, trying in vain to save a stupid script. One funny thing is that everyone in the film has a different accent, and with the exception of one guy, no one can do a south philly accent.  Sal Mazzotta is trying real hard to be James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, but I'm sorry... he may be a nice guy in real life, but the guy couldn't act scared in a graveyard at midnight. And come on; this guy as a gangster? Maybe as Lurch in the Adams Family.  This movie is also plauged by choppy editing and poor camera work. I mean in a few scenes the camera is actually going in and out of focus while people are talking. Don't they teach that in film school? And usually when two people are talking their heads will be turned to one angle for the wide two person shot, and at completely different angles for close ups, like maybe the close up stuff was done much later.    Save your money. Wish I could get mine back. It's been a long time since I saw a movie so bad I felt angry and ripped off for having seen it.     
 Turns out I purchased this cd for one song.  I was very disappointed with the rest of the cd.  The song At Last is wonderful but one song is not worth the price of the entire cd 
 The method itself is extremely interesting, unfortunately the authors repeat the same examples over and over again. Very annoying. The style borders on boring. I would recommend definitely reading the book from Savransky as a much better example of TRI 
 I recently saw this book on the bargain bin.  This book was pure garbage, by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits.  Basically they are saying valuations don't matter.  Since they wrote the book, it has been prooven that their philosophy, approached over the long term, produces some great damaging losses.  The book may be useful during the next bubble, which if history serves, will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky.  To the dungeon with these two knaves 
 This text is not suitable for students at all. You will get more use out of this book as a doorjamb. Very disorganized and poorly written. Takes straightforward epidemiologcial concepts and overly comlpicates them. Don't believe the 5 star ratings. They are highly suspect and appear to be written by the authors themselves or their groupies. If you are a student trying to learn epidemiology, avoid this book at all costs 
 I am not afraid to look the reality of colorism in the eye and acknowledge that it does exist within the black community. It is my greatest hope and dream that someday the dark skinned black and the light skinned black will be seen as the one family in the future. I want so much to love the lightskinned sister and brother as my own reflection and not be divided from them or made to feel that one is treated better than the other, but sadly, that day is not here and this book bravely and powerfully illustrates that point to the fullest.   I am a medium brown colored woman, my mother was very dark skinned and I have witnessed the evils of skin color prejudice all my life. In most situations, it was Black Men who were prejudiced against myself and the women around me beccause of our coloring. These men felt no shame or limit in their racist intra-family prejudice and measured their entire lives by how many light skinned or white women they could attain and how light brite their children could come out. It's everywhere and anyone who denies it is both a fool and a liar.   That is why I highly recommend THE BLACKER THE BERRY by Wallace Thurman. There is no truer portrait of the self-hatred among our people than the one extolled in this book, and what makes it even sadder is that this book was written in the 1920's. So that only shows how deep this kind of evil runs.   Lately, I have become very interested in this subject and I have searched for other books that explore this subject with intelligence, honest, beauty and wisdom and I have found several that I consider to be classics on the subject of Colorism.   (1) MARITA GOLDEN'S book "Don't Play In the Sun" is definitely the most modern up to date book of the bunch. It expertly weaves the story of her life experiences in the 1960's Black Power movement with the current struggles of women like Serena Williams and India Arie to find their way in the world, even in the midst of being shunned and ignored by the black community itself. The book's analysis of the Hollywood casting system and the "Mulatto Follies" of BET and MTV is priceless.   (2) "The Bluest Eye" by TONI MORRISON is by far the most riveting and painful book that I have read on this subject of colorism. I believe that her book, more than any mother, gets to the psychological and historical root cause of the problem and exposes the mode in which we pass the problem on generation to generation. The destruction of an innocent black girl named Pecola Breedlove will leave you heartbroken and shocked as you see the bold naked truth unfold right before your eyes. You can't ignore this book, because the story being told is the one that you are all too familiar with no matter what color you are.   (3) "Flesh and the Devil" by African novelist KOLA BOOF is another deeply powerful book that examines colorism, but not out in the open. This book is unique in that it focuses on a very enchanting love story between a Black Prince and Princess and follows their reincarnations through history as they struggle to find their way back to each other. Through detailed moments in black history, both in Africa and the United States, the provocative author highlights the way that black people originally viewed their beauty and humanity and then juxtuposes it against the way they see themselves now in the modern world. The result is nothing less than devastating. I love this book so much, because the storytelling is so rich and the depth is so sweeping and grand. Anyone who loves good writing and is proud to be descended from the Black race will find themselves literally changed forever by the powerful images depicted in this very poetically moving story.   (4) "The Color Complex"--VARIOUS AUTHORS, is a very simple, straight forward analysis from a sociological point of view. Much research and statistical facts are used to illustrate that our communities are infested with these issues.   (5) "The Darkest Child" by Dolores Philips is another great novel that shows us the poor blacks who live under the poverty line ingesting these complex social hierarchies based on color and how they not only expose their children to them, but force the entire community to live by the "color code". Everybody is used to it from slavery and the system goes on and on unchallenged. In this book, Tangy Mae, the darkest of 10 children by the white-looking mother Rozelle, struggles to find her dignity and confidence in the midst of her evil light skinned mother inflicting one horrid abuse on top of the other. One thing I will say for the evil white-looking mother, Rozelle, is that she treated all of her children hiddeously and with contempt, from the whitest to the blackest. But she killed the child who was born looking like Tangy Mae and that spoke volumnes. This book is a very real metaphor for what goes on. Very real.   
 this is too funny Ohio exit polling must have been much like Illinois?  I voted Bush and afterwards was Swarmed by 3 thug looking "exit pollers" who looked angry when they asked me who I voted for   "Kerry" was my response... they happily jotted it down.  so much for the exit poll conspiracy.  please don't slice my tires !!!!  
  The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.   Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did."  If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet.   
 I bought this one because of the good reviews here and I was very...very disaponted. It has more bass compared with most of the other speakers of the similiar size but the problem is that the music is twisted (in order to empasize bass) sounding like from a can. I returned it and bought a Klipsch Promedia 2.0 and there is simly no comparison!  It's not fair to reqire this kind of tiny speakers to perform, but the  Bose's problem is to use a price tag to impress the buyers in stead of focusing on quality.  I believe some of the reviewers here are just new to home audio. I still remember how I was excited when upgrading my OEM dell speakers to a entry-level 3.1 system for the first time.  Well, if you do not believe me, just buy a pair of Klipsch ProMedio 2.0 and see for yourself if Bose worths even $50.       
 there is only one asimov.. and only one douglas adams (who in my opinion is not really all that funny and definitely not in the same league as asimov)  but terry pratchet is neither and he is trying just too hard to be funny.  or my tolerance for fiction has gone down over the year.. 
 I was expecting more out of this CD. Not so interesting as the classic Neil Young stuf 
 Given the provocative title, I expected to find a full-blown critique of the state of our current culture and just how it got that way. Was I ever wrong: the book was overblown and there was no critique. Nor was there a defense of today's culture. While the book was good at explaining today's culture and its history (particularly the development of the paperback book), there is no follow-up. As one earlier reviewer perceptively noted, it's as if the author was merely writing a term paper. And nowhere is this more evident than in his description of professional wrestling, which he seems to have researched solely on his television set. As if to provide a bit of validity to this exposition, he includes a lengthy quote from Rolaand Barthes' essay on wrestling. Nice, except that Barthes doesn't know what he's talking about, either, and something I would expect from a term paper, not a book. The sections on wrestling and movies only serve to date the book rather badly, and without any sort of conclusions or judgments, the book dates as badly as an issue of Life magazine, only it lacks any nostalgia value. Skip this one and read Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death instead (which, by the way, the author does critique; dismissing it as a mere jeremiad.) If you must buy this tome, buy it on the cheap; your disappointment will then be less 
 The writing is technically competent.  The story is the problem.  I don't know how old Alison Baird is, but this book certainly reads as though it were written by a 16-year-old girl.  There is little about the story that can be called original; even the surprise twist at the end is perfectly obvious by a third of the way through.  We are given a hodge-podge of poorly-blended elements that, the competency of the writing excepted, closely resembles teenage fan fiction.  Magic stones, dragon riding, hidden destinies, a token black character -- and, of course, the certainty of two more volumes to come.  This book is sure to appeal to a great many teenagers.  Grown-ups may find it tedious 
 Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman. Bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man, with Firth as the anchor of the team. Off-stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives. But I found "Truth" confusing and unengaging. I found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo. And as several have noted, Lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible. Give this one a pass 
 A retrospective of the photographer's work, not useful as a guide to how to. And of kinds of buildings we're not likely to photograph today. Didn't help me with clues to photographing interiors 
 I couldn't finish this book and I'm not sure if the problem is in the writing or in the editing.  At times the author seems to take these great leaps based on one or two anecdotes from his life and it is just not convincing.  There are some interesting details here and there but for me, it was just too rambling and all over the map.  
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 Batman Begins is soooo much better than this or any other of the batman movies. Nicholson SUCKED as the Joker. Joker is a comedian who had an accident trying to pull a robbery to help his pregnant wife. HE IS NOT A GANGSTER OR THE ONE WHO KILLED BATMAN'S PARENTS!!!! HE IS A PSYCHO AND BATMAN'S NEMESIS!!! YOU CAN'T KILL HIM OFF!!! HOW STUPID IS THAT?!!! Who came up with that one. Keaton is a sissy, Christian Bale could beat him down!!! Keaton DID NOT have the physical prescence to play Batman. All in all, a joke of a comic movie..But it is better than Daredevil!!!!:- 
 This DVD gets only 2 stars because the 4:3 TV screen format of this DVD production is really ridiculous.  But the movie is one of my favorites, number 4 on my all time best movies list. The feel of the movie is more like that of a typical 70's sci fi movie (like 'Andromeda') than of a 60's movie. Austere and unemotional (like Colossus himself), quietly and punctuously narrated, minimalistically acted and with minimal action - a movie for the brain, as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world. I like the outdated look of the technology in the movie - black-and-green screens, LED displays, printout terminals etc. Really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the 60's. And captures- then reasonable-appearing - fears of computers surpassing human beings. ATTENTION! SPOILER! The movie has no happy end, the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end. Just as it is in D.F. Jones' novel 'Colossus' on which the movie is based. And that's another reason why I like the movie so much - one of the few movies WITHOUT a forseeable and boring happy ending. The absence of a happy ending is not the absence of an ending, by the way, contrary to what has been supposed by a previous reviewer.  This movie almost has the quality of a Kubrick 
 Generic lyrics kill this album. Nothing separates this band from so many others that are coming out 
 If you enjoy the idea of Lester Bangs, don't read his writing. It just proves he was never anything but another drugged-up beat scumbag. And not in an amusing way 
 This book was on the bestseller's shelf at my local bookstore.  I asked an employee about how books were selected for that shelf and was told that selection is based on a number of factors including positive customer reviews.  Shocking.  As a number of other customer's have commented on this site, this book was not worth the money it cost.  It was silly, contrived and unrealistic.    The cover of the book states that the writer is one of the best romance writers of all time.  I typically don't read romance novels but I can't begin to imagine that that's possible.  
 The author denies that your thyroid problem is your own fault, telling you you need to get involved with all the medical aspects and tell your doctor what you need.  If your doctor doesn't listen to you then find another doctor.  Monitor your TC levels through blood tests (if/when you can afford them).  Then the last chapter is all about how much Thyroid therapy can help (as in 12 step programs) to discover that your stresses and life problems probably started the whole thing in the first place.  Athough it is NOT YOUR fault.  All the while insinuating that it, in fact, IS your fault.  Weird book.  I would NOT recommend it unless you're very young and have never heard of a 12 step program and have 24/7 hours a day to monitor your progress.  Then, go for it.  Otherwise, find a better alternative.  
 This "biography" is one, long malicious attack upon Carl Sagan.  Keay Davidson obviously detests Sagan - so much so that I don't know why he would wrire a book about someone he hates so much.  Only someone who hates Sagan could enjoy this book - but anyone who hates Sagan wouldn't be buying/reading a biography about him anyway.  This book has no real audience.  I would rate it ZERO stars if I were able.  If you like anything Carl did, please look elsewhere for a biography and do not waste a penny or a second on this unfathomably putrid piece of attack-journalism 
 Read the reviews. This is not a photography book. It is a book on psychology. As a photographer I give this 1 star. This may very well be a good psycology book 
 Last night I finished this book and it was probably the most awful book I've ever read. Written by a fictional character as a spin-off of the television show "Lost," it is a mystery loosely related to the show's back story. That is, it involves companies and institutions that exist in the "real life" of the show. Very meta. I'm not a fan of mysteries, so maybe I'm a little biased to begin with. I expected a light and easy read. I expected some writing to chuckle at, but not something to be truly annoyed by. Shouldn't a private detective be able to do some deducing on his own? He seemed not to have an original thought at all. And when he reached a decision, some sort of epiphany, it never came through any sort of deliberation. It took about half the novel to even get the story along enough for us to understand what mystery we were sorting out. But even at that point I had faith that it would all turn out well. People enjoy these sorts of books, so it should have all the necessary tricks. Soon enough we had a murder of one of the principal characters that occurred off the page, and then we were at the dramatic scene. Then something surprising and unexplained, not foretold, happens, then 'end scene.' Then the last few pages of the book are spent with three characters talking about everything and explaining what happened, why people were killed, the villain's motivations and the like. Then it was over. I hate it when movies have to explain it to you through dialogue at the end, and I'm certainly insulted when a book does it to me. "Ugh," I said as I put the book on my night stand 
 I've read the Very Short Introduction series on Poststructuralism and Art Theory, and they were excellent (I use them in my classes, because they're so clear and concise, beautifully outlined, and so well written, and I've recommended them to my students). I already know quite a lot about these subjects, but I learned a lot.  So I was expecting a good solid work this time too, but it was  pure negativity. He's hostile toward the subject, and the book reads like a harangue, or an editorial. It's just not a serious treatment of the subject 
 I find tomatoes to be overrated.  They're an important ingredient in many things, obviously, but as an item themselves they're of limited use.  They taste alright, but their texture is too screwed up.  The only time I ever really eat raw tomatoes is on hamburgers and sandwiches, and usually prefer not to have them, as they destablilize the whole sandwich so that it all falls apart.  Obnoxious, that is 
 Roger Ebert, a review I greatly respect and normally agree with, raved about this flick.  Roger, I love you, but you missed the boat on this one.  I'm not going to review the plot because it's been done by several reviewers already.  Suffice it to say, David Lynch didn't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman English ("Okay, class, who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig's head on page 72 in Lord of the Flies?  David, how about you?") and now want to inflict it on you, the unwitting movie watching public.  Thanks, Mr. Lynch, but I'll pass.  I didn't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of Crime and Punishment and I didn't enjoy it in scene after scene of Mulholland Drive.     To add insult to injury, Lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense, rationalizing it by saying life often doesn't make sense.  This habit of his is less noticible in this film than, say, Twin Peaks, mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless.  Yeah, it's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life, but more along the lines of "...I would've won Powerball this week except I spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the RenFaire, what the heck was I thinking..." or "...I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie, what the heck was I thinking..." but I've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf.  I must live a sheltered life or something.  Lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his DVD, believing his movie must be watched in its entirety, or not at all (I'd advise the second.)  To be fair, in this case I don't think he's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance, but rather by the knowledge that every male, if given the chance, would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action.  C'mon all you 5 star givers, admit it!  You find the movie pretentious and silly, but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy pseudo-art!    To reiterate, if I wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I'll rewatch Dallas - if I wanted to see a nice rack I'll take my top off and look in the mirror.  Who needs Mulholland Drive 
 I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't.  This book is mediocre at best.  I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did.  I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim.  I doubt I will ever meet a "Wim" in real life!).  My favorite Danielle Steel novels are "The Gift" and "Safe Harbour".  I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories.  If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try 
 This is NOT a book!! It is a fold of about 25 half-size pages stapled in the center with a cover of card stock printed in black.  The information was totally ho-hum.  Common sense and an IQ of more than 20 will give you the same information with a quick look at the front of any book.  Then there's the cost!!!!!  $15.95 plus $3.49 shipping.  The book would have easily fit into a #10 business envelope and shipped for forty cents.  Needless to say I returned it ASAP 
     First of all, Steve Vai is in my opinion one of the most talented and exciting guitar players/musicians I've had the pleasure to see. That's high praise, because I've seen Stevie Ray, Van Halen (Roth era), Rhoads, Foghat, Frampton.......you get the picture. He is also an amazing person to meet and talk to. Very spiritual and just a great person; very positive.    Lately though, each time Steve puts out a new cd, I become more hesitant to lay down the cash because his music rocks less and just pushes the envelope in the wrong direction. This cd is too experimental. The playing is great, but the songs have no balls to them. Maybe Disney could use him for all the kids animation movies? It's just "girly".    I know he knows what people want, because he plays all the cool stuff in his live shows. Why is that? Because that's the stuff that is moving and what makes a live show "live". So why must we be subjected to  all the "filler" stuff? I'm not saying that all the songs have to be fast and rip, because he can play 2 notes with as much feeling as 1,000 notes. Please Steve, just write some songs in song form. The world is waiting for more jaw dropping music 
 Gives basic overview of exercises with mini-weights that probably won't get you the beach body you want.   There are better, more realistic books out there (ie: Body-for-LIFE, Sculpting Her Body Perfect). If you're the type who reads Shape magazine, you may like it. If you're a Muscle & Fitness Hers or FitnessRX reader, you will think it's lame 
 I love a great escape and a good story.  This was none of the above.  It reminded me of dull elevator chat that you aren't really paying attention to anyway.    Rarely can I not finish a book, but that's not the case with this one.  
 It's difficult to believe that the author of the wonderful Dorothy Martin mystery series is also the perpetrator of this terrible stinker.  Stupid plot, stupid characters...yeccchhhhh!!!!! 
 I appreciate the historical significance of the Kabbalistic writings in this book, but I find it to be mis-titled, since it is dealing mostly with the conjuration the angels, and the only parts pertaining to daemons say to use to power of Jehovah or whatever to "caputure" the daemons and force them to do your bidding.  This is, obviously, a very bad idea.  Daemons do not appreciate such insult.  Secondly, it is ridiculous to dapple in both angels and daemons and again, a very bad idea.  
 Ultra Chilled series got weaker here (though this is a stronger effort than 5).  The standouts on the CD are Erlend Oye's, "Prego Amore" and Kelli Ali's beautifully haunting track, "Sunlight in the Rain," both of which you can play over and over again without getting tired.  Other than that there is a mix of mediocre songs 
 Bernard Lewis is a historian of the Ottoman era.  Period.  He sets himself up as an expert on Arabs and the modern Middle East, which is preposterous.  He does not know Arabic and certainly does not routinely converse with modern Arabs, in all of their many countries.  He uses terms like Unbelievers, which insults Westerners, when Muslims never do and never would -- that term is used by extremists whose mentality is much like that of our White Aryans.  And just about as representative.  In everything he writes, Lewis harps on the House of War and House of Peace, an idea one thousand years out of date.  That was Crusader-era thinking, which was outrageous and should embarrass both sides today. The problem is not religion, it is political policies, and long digressions into Crusader and post-Crusader history do not shed insight into beliefs and resentments today.  He uses broad terms like "Muslim rage" -- all Muslims?  Certainly not.  Consider his assertion that it is an intolerable humiliation for Muslims to be taught by Unbelievers -- does that make sense?  With the thousands of Muslims who are being, and have been, educated in the West?  Who hire Western advisors? "What went wrong?"  Western intrusion into the Middle East region, that's what.  Today most vividly illustrated by Israel and Iraq, and shoring up corrupt regimes like the Saudis (who are no friends of America and promote their exclusivist religion to our detriment).  But to admit political issues is to bring up the too-painful possibility of reviewing America's policies, so Lewis et al. harp on religion (are 5 million Muslims in America motivated to hurt anybody? They are in every city and town.  Do they hate America and or non-Muslims?  Try asking them, because Lewis certainly has not).   Lewis has done immeasurable damage to the image of Muslims and Middle Easterners, and fostered much hatred based on his reckless statements.  This is the EXPERT who advised the Bush White House and encouraged the neocon insanity to go about happily creating democracies in the Middle East which would then lead to love all around...  easy success in Iraq would be just the beginning of this miracle.  On this rests his credibility 
 As a Will Ferrell fan I will go easy.  This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Had I seen this in the theaters I would have demanded my money back. 
 This is a simplistic, out of date treatment of a diverse and rapidly changing field. It is a disappoint that Bar Yam failed to capture the depth of the field, instead offering a cursory look at, mostly, classical examples in which Bar Yam did not take part. I would prefer, instead, to see a leader in the field write such a text, such that I could be assured that details that were omitted were less relevant, not simply forgotten 
 This book has an intriguing concept, but doesn't do much with it.  Everything is done on a supeficial level.  It is like a Hollywood movie script.  Everything is clean, neat and easy.  The hero has a compelling reason for what he does, instead of it just being basic human instinct.  There are some neat twists in this book near the end, but there are a lot of things that don't really make sense.   This is another case of someone developing an elaborate plot, instead of just simply killing someone.  And the shootout in the end is very predictable.  The hero, who is a genius, successful business man develops an infatuation and gets drawn into the world of cyberporn and prostitution and makes some stupid mistakes.  This is a great premise and could make a great book.  Successful, upstanding people do get involved in elicit sexual activities and do stupid things all the time.  A study on this would be very interesting.  But, this book gives the hero a simple and heroic reason for doing the stupid things he does.  The book also takes a surface look at the internet, internet porn and its relationship to escort services.  This could have been an interesting world to explore.  Who are these people, how do these business works, what prompts a person to be in the business, etc.  In this book, all the men involved in the industry are evil murderers, and all the women are helpless victims.  Is that always the case?  This book suffers from moslty cardboard characters, with no depth.  The hero is a supergenius and the best in his field.  That was gotten to be a very boring cliche.  The friend who knows the internet and is the best hacker in the world is another tired cliche.  The cop, the ex-girlfriend, and the lawyer are all stereotypes.  In the end, it was mildly entertaining.  And there are a few bits of detective work throughout the book that were pretty clever.   But, I just started reading a book by Elmore Leonard.  Just in the first few pages, you can tell that this will be a superior book by a much superior writer.       
 We did this book in a bookclub.  The language in the book was a bit rough I thought and it was just plain weird.  Would not recommend this book for anyone to read. 
 This is a rocket ride of a book. It stars with Textpad, then flies into Photoshop, then back into Textpad for a quick ride through the basics of HTML and CSS. There is some reference at the end, but frankly it's too little too late. The back of the book exhorts that you don't have to know everything to get your job done, and while that may apply to other fields like Powerpoint or Word, it doesn't work here. You need to understand the fundamentals of HTML if you want to go past the examples shown here.  For a complete introduction starting with the fundamentals I recommend O'Reilly's excellent HTML & XHTML : The Definitive Guide 
 This is the worst war picture I have ever seen with the possible exception of "Corregidor.&quot 
 I wish I could give this stroller 0 stars because it doesn't even deserve the one I gave it. It's a light stroller..there...the only plus. Where do I start...how about how after using it for one week the wheel fell off and they wanted to charge me shipping to replace it because I didn't have a reciept ( it was shower gift) After arguing with their lack- luster service team and proving with a birth ceritficate that my daughter was only a week old and that is as long as I had been using it, they shipped a new wheel free of charge...Fast forward to our vacation in Hawaii. The sun shade is non existent and I had to use a light blanket draped over the hood to protect my baby from the sun. The steering stinks, I have spilled drinks all over me and my baby because the cup holder moves AND doesn't hold anything but a small water bottle. The basket is hard to get to and holds nothing easily because it is so awkward. My husband and I went on a hike and came to the end of the path that wasn't paved. He asked me, "Are you worried about leaving the stroller so we can continue on the sand?" I replied "PLEASE....I hope someone takes this piece of @8!!8#!!!" End of story...I wouldn't invest in the Pliko P3 either. Don't get me started in the Peg Perego car seat either...JUNK!! 
 I spent years waiting for this novel. And then I finally got it from my wife for my birthday. I have to say that I was quite disappointed.   First, the conflict in the story is presented in such a fashion that it is hard to be anything but detached from it. While I am aware that I am from Generation Why and am divorced from the concept of caring about fictional or real characters and their trials and tribulations, the fact of the matter is that it was remarkably difficult to really care about ANYTHING that happened in this book, including the gang rape of the inhabitants of the tower.  What should have been an interesting study in the strife and malfunction of human relationships, the stranding of a thousand people on a desert island in the middle of a society that they are functionally free to escape to at any time, was underdeveloped and overprocessed. The result was that a wonderful story premise was destroyed. We know why three or four of the characters stayed in the tower. What about the rest? We only know anything about three of the characters in the entire story, and their motivations seem...lacking for the determination to survive and thrive in this environment that they are presented in.   If you want a dystopian epic about what can go wrong in a building like this, go pick up Neal Stephenson's The Big U. It is far more credible and far more entertaining. Much better overall.  The two good things about this: The first paragraph and the last page. The nihilism and the destruction wrought by the people in the first tower makes reading the book tolerable. And the first paragraph is the single most interesting beginning of a story that I have ever read. These two things are why it is getting a star above minimum.  Go read something better. This is overrated.  Harkiu 
 This book has some good information. The authors seem to be knowledgable about the technical side of photography, but don't have the eye for it 
 This was the second worst star Wars novel I have ever read, the only one worse was the Courtship of Princess Leia 
 as mentioned before, the track "Message to the Queen" is a ripoff from the Macedonian song "Zajdi Zajdi". If he noted the original song as inspiration, it would be cool, but he signed it as his own. Poor taste, so I'm actually skipping this album. 
 This is a good product, except it keeps shutting down when I have my outlook or when I have a web page open.   My main goal for an antivirus would be to run when I search the web or get in new emails!   What good is it if it shuts down when these are open!   It did find a trojan on my first scan.  This was one that Norton missed.  I will be getting NOD32 soon.  Sorry this product did not work for me! It was very easy to use 
   The one star is not for Philip Roth, who of course is a major American novelist. The one star is for the book designer. Is Philip Roth such an incomparably great writer that, unlike James and Faulkner and Melville, his name needs to be emblazoned in giant white letters on the spine of the book? For the first time in the LOA series, the author's name does not appear in horizontal white calligraphic script; instead, it appears in giant white letters running vertically the length of the spine. So when you look at your bookshelves loaded with LOA volumes, "ROTH" leaps out at you.  I grow increasingly disenchanted with the LOA. It started promisingly enough, with the Northwestern-Newberry texts of Melville, the Univ. of California/Mark Twain Project texts for Twain, the Polk/Blotner texts for Faulkner, etc. Major writers complete in the most authoritative texts available -- a simple recipe for success.  Now, to fill its overly ambitious, overly prolific publishing schedule, LOA publishes journalism and second- and third-rate authors such as Dashell Hammett, Dawn Powell, and Paul Bowles. Why? Partially, at least, because the copyright on these authors' works is owned by Random House/Vintage, which seems to have a death grip on what LOA publishes. Commercial interest has, inevitably, overridden and diluted the initial vision of a canon of truly great American literature.  Not to mention that the series started with 1400- or 1500-page volumes being the norm. New volumes routinely have half that number of pages. The bean counters are doing math somewhere...  My two cents: publish fewer volumes and concentrate on the indisputably major authors. (Where is Melville's poetry?!) And publish no works by writers whose work has not passed out of copyright and into the public domain. Let time do its work of sifting out the writers who truly matter. Instant canonization is a farce. Unlike France with its comparable Pleiade series, America is a young country -- so of course the series will have fewer volumes. So what? LOA is sacrificing quality for quantity and going for the almighty dollar.   
 I could not force myself to watch this film in its entirety. I think I made it about 45 minutes in. Despite many fine actors, esp. the always interesting Jeff Bridges, who brings a layered sadness to many of his roles, I simply could not connect and did not care about these people.  It was this huge budget American movie shorthand: we're supposed to care because we've been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of something else, but it just doesn't work for me. If I don't care this far into the movie, it just won't happen.  Visually beautiful, and sky high production values on costumes and sets, it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling. Whoever cast the extras has wonderful faces, which the cinematographer and editor took full advantage of, but why don't we get faces like that in the major characters. Of course Chris Cooper has that kind of face, but many others (esp. all the "size 2 women" in the supporting roles)seem to have stepped out of a commercial.  The Chicago tribune called this film "sleek and beautiful." I will completely agree with that, but so are music videos. I kept asking myself, what is wrong, what is misfiring? I really wanted to like it. Some of it is the short-hand story telling, but the look was almost too pretty. When the cinematography is this gorgeous, you want and need to linger on something smaller and deeper, or really take all the time you need to connect with something bigger -a mini-series.   Ultimately, I began wondering if the original length was much longer, and it was cut down so much that it became fractured, and if that is the case, my apologies to the director. This is the kind of film that makes me ponder, what is it that European film-makers "get" that we lose in our big budget studio films? Is the system itself hurting some films, by sanitizing and conforming them, when they need to stick out like an unruly horse's nose at the starting gate?  Very beautiful, but no connection, and not satisfying... well, that's a lot of things in Hollywood in a nutshell, isn't it?   There are lots of special features on this DVD, but if I can't sit through the film, I don't care about the extras.  So glad I borrowed this instead of buying it!  I hear the book is something wonderful... 
 I was disappointed in this book for all the reasons mentioned by Ms. Janis. All of her comments ring true, everyday. I too remember articles about losing at tennis or "50 ways to make him happy" published in magazines of my youth.  I also remember being told that if I wanted to find a man, I had to be less-smart and ditch my glasses. Well here I am, new to the 50 Club, still wearing glasses and smarter than ever! If my only chance for finding romance with a man who may have ED, looks as bad as Jack Nicholson did in "Something's Gotta Give" and is hooked on Viagra  - I'll stay home and watch old movies on TCM. In short, why should I sacrifice who I am and bother with the face-lifts, new teeth and other false-hoods that society still fosters when all men over 50 want is a younger woman who will boost their image and ego. Amen 
 I like this type of opener very much, and wanted to replace another similar model that had lasted a year before failing.  So I opened the package, and tried to open a bottle of wine, but the corkscrew would not lock.  I'm not even sure I'll send it back given the warranty hassle, shipping costs, etc, given the price.  I just can't recommend this brand to anyone 
 -Everyone expressing a erudite opinion about Clausewitz or "ON WAR" has completely missed the point here.  -The question is NOT whether Clausewitz or "On War" is an essential read for everyone interested in military hsitory or military affairs. THAT is a moot piont to the Nth Degree.  -The REAL question IS - WHY would you pay $595.oo for a book that has the same identical information as another book for $30.oo ?!?!?!?   -That is the ONLY question regarding THIS particular version of "ON WAR".  -Its the ECONOMICS, stupid ! 
 If you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews, you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good (not great) acting.  Jessica Lange basically does an impression of Marilyn Monroe with a southern accent.  Well not all of the time, since her accent seems to come and go.  The amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has.  Skip it unless you really, really, really love Jessica Lange.  By the way, if this movie is set in the early sixties, why does the daughter have a peace sign on her bedroom wall?  This is the same daughter that finds a grenade in a drawer and promptly pulls the pin and tosses it to her boyfriend! Puh-lease 
 Does not show you techniques rather it just shows pictures!  After buying this book- I was very disappointed since I thought it will show me makeup tips and tricks, rather it just shows displays of women's faces.  You will waste your money on purchasing this book 
 After watching this lame, stupid sequel all I can say is "Leave it alone already!" God this film sucked. First, after 25 years of trying to escape from brother Michael, this is how Laurie Strode goes out???!!! Major let down, it should have been more shocking and spectacular. Second, while "20 Years Later/Halloween 7" was made for Lifetime, this one seems to have been made for MTV. All Dimension films has done for this franchise since taking it over for Part 6, is give it style, no substance whatsoever. The only one of their 3 sequels that was remotely scary was 6, fully due to bringing back the guy who played Michael in 4(the last good Halloween film)George Wilbur, he's sorely missed but probably too old for the part now. Third, I'm so sick of rappers and models thinking they can act as is the case in this film with Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks. No talent Busta needs to stick to cursing and throwing his hands around to a repetitive beat and Tyra needs to stick to walking a catwalk in some designer dress with her mouth shut. They suck. Hopefully Hollywood feels the same way since I haven't seen them in anything since, thank god. Fourth, the story is just another retread with a new gimmick, the internet web cam. Poorly executed, no suspense at all in this film. The film was originally suppossed to be released for Halloween '01, but they had to do reshoots to improve the film, unsuccessfully I might add, so it was released in summer '02. Funny, this film was directed by the same guy who directed "Halloween II"(the best sequel). Even funnier is the fact that they had to do reshoots for that one as well, but John Carpenter did them and it DID improve the film. His touch is sorely missed here.   So, if dreadful acting(except Jaime Lee Curtis, but she's only in the first 10 minutes, unfortunately), boring, dumb story and dialogue, shockless, routine kill scenes and no scares or suspense(unless your 10 years old and have never seen a horror film) if all that's your cup of tea then by all means watch or buy this waste of time, money & effort(if there was any). It's just another insult to fans of the original.   And now, for next Halloween('07) we will get "Halloween:The Remake" directed by none other than the man who brought us the classic(NOT!!!) "House Of 1000 Corpses", Rob Zombie!    I'm also sick of bad singers thinking they can direct. The choice is refective of Hollywood nowadays, style over substance, cool and trendy over timeless and great. 
 Take a step back from your revulsion (a healthy human reaction, so I do hope you were revolted...) to the detailed ritualistic torture of animals and children found in Hard Truth, and analyze the character development and plot development of the last 3 or 4 Anna Pigeon books.  Anna Pigeon as a person is fast becoming a 1-dimensional charicature of the person we met in the first few books; at the same time the author is digging a Natchez Trace of a rut in plot progression - repackaging over again the crazed killer whose insanity is able to drive him through repeated injury to keep after Anna page after page after page. It's as if an editor has said "the stylized nightmare is hot in the industry these days, so rewrite most of the story to be the 'bogeyman' chasing the heroine who just runs and runs and runs."  I can only hope it's an editor saying that, and not a personal problem of the author's.   If one separated the pages of character development from the pages of "insanity-driven bogeyman keeps coming toward Anna" in any recent Nevada Barr book, would there be much more than a short story 
    The quest for the limits of deduction is a well-precedented and exciting topic, and is worth of deep study.  If this is your opinion, then this book is worth glancing at.  Certainly Chaitin's unique approach to tackling the notion of incompleteness cuts to the core of the matter, and is free from the beautiful self-referential chains that bind the reader from a clear understanding of Godel's first and second incompleteness theorems.      Even so, Chaitin's opinions of science, his iconic worship of Leibniz (and consequent condemnation of Newton), his accusative implication that Godel's contributions to deductive logic are overblown and confusing, make this book difficult to read.  On the one hand, Chaitin appears to be a haughty mathematician reaching to mask his low self esteem.  He constantly references his 'teenage' work, and the technical reading that he was able to accomplish at the age of 12.  These comments are ostentatiously interweaved into a forest of exclamation points, and the thesis that he alone understood and extrapollated on Leibniz's understanding of algorithmic complexity.  I believe that this book is very much about an author desperately trying to establish his legacy as a great mathematician, and not just a simple read about the limits of knowledge.  If you can stomach pages of writing from a self-aggrandizing braggart (establishing himself as Leibniz's natural successor in the understanding of information), and have a deep need to understand the notion of incompleteness in a new and innovative light, then I recommend this book only to you. 
 The debate over this movie appears to be heated. Here are my two cents. I have been a Larry fan for many years and have seen him live several times. The Blue Collar shows/movies are wonderful platforms for Larry to shine. Regretfully, this is not a well written movie and Larry suffers for it. One of the bright spots in the show was the supporting cast. Larry's partner, played by Iris Bahr, shows great talent and promise in her role. She made the most of a quirky character. I would recommend that if you just want to see this movie, rent it. If you are a die-hard Larry fan, go ahead and pick it up for keeps. I'm hoping that Larry gets a second chance to be highlighted as he is absolutely hilarious and could really do well if given a quality script to work with 
 This book, republished in 2002, purports to "analyze" Arabs, based on Patai's acquaintances in one region of the Arab world, Bedouins and shopkeepers, in the thirties and forties.  It does not describe 220 million modern Arabs in 22 countries.  The book opens with vicious characterizations of Arabs written in the 14th and 15th centuries, mentions burying of female infants (which Islam stopped definitively in the seventh century--is exposure of infants an insight to Greek and Italian cultures today?)  Patai did not know Arabic well; he generalizes regional vocabulary, makes laughable assertions, -- Arabic has no tenses? No word for "children"(?) (all languages with grammatical gender use masculine for plural, as in "mis padres").  And more... Patai claims that "Arab" fathers beat, whip their children to enure them to pain (!), discusses deviant sex, says homosexuality is more "liberal" than in the West (it is illegal and despised in this conservative culture, in some cases a capital crime).  He tells us that Arab women are viewed "like animals, highly sexed," who cannot resist temptation, that there is genital contact between women and their male infants (this is as weird as if saying it about Americans!)   He did not publish for twenty years, and even then, statistics are 1950-1970.  What century are we in?  What level of society?  Did Patai know anyone educated, sophisticated, modern?  In Cairo, Tunis, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut?  This is 2005.  Why is this book still on the market, dated 2002? The prospective reader should search out book reviews on Google so the book can be read in a context, knowing its deficiencies; the reviews are well documented, written by thoughtful people, not rants.   This book is deservedly called "the Bible of the neocons" and is directly responsible for emphasis on sexual humiliation at Abu Ghraib.  Like Bernard Lewis later, Patai cites quaint superstitions as current, uses past events to "explain" modern Arabs, and does not distinguish between extremism and the realities of modern Arab society.  I think it is the poisonous counterpart to Protocols of the Elders of Zion.   Arabs/Muslims as devious, abhorrent, and threatening 
 According to the IMDB this movie is the first one specifically made for PC downloading...it shows.  Without any creative vision at all; horrible lighting, acting and editing and a confusing, muddled storyline, INCUBUS is everthing a bad horror movie should be.  Tedious.  Stupid.  And just not worth it, folks 
 This film is deeply disturbing.  Besides being utterly revolting, this film also leaves the viewer contemplating suicide after being submitted to such utter depravity and lack of anything decent or worthy of flattery.  What an utter waste of film.  Don't waste your time or money 
 The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star.  As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means.  He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans.  I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is.  At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning.  A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say.  Don't buy this book.  
 This is a book by JA Jance?  This book took a potentially good storyline (plot) and made it seem stupid because it was so simplistic in its writing style, which is UNLIKE JA Jance.  This book seemed to be to be written for a young-adult reader audience.   I had to force myself to read it all the way through because I must admit, I was curious as to the conclusion, but I did not derive any pleasure from reading this book.  A waste of time 
 This novel starts out okay, but rapidly deteriorates into a maudlin melodrama of cardboard characters.  After I began reading this, I thought it seemed very formulaic compared to other Ludlum novels.  My biggest problems with the book can be put into two basic categories:  One - The man with no name who is too dangerous to let go.  This theme is well done with Jason Bourne, but far too commonplace here. Several times I felt that if the main character was this well trained, he never would have pursued his course of action.  Two - The reasonable female.  The girl is far too willing to accept really bad things here.  No convincing is needed - just imply cloak and dagger and the girl falls in line.  I started out liking the book - but ended up hating it 
 The Starter Wife started out promisingly vapid, in an entertaining way, but rapidly became more disgusting than anything else.  The narcissitic self obsession rang true (not surprising given the author's similar lifestyle), and the ways in which it was indulged were fascinatingly ridiculous.  However, those descriptions only hold interest for so long, and then the book digresses into an unrealistic, annoying conclusion.  The insight into an actual L.A. Wife Of lifestyle is unbelievable enough; to try to throw in a homeless guy that leads an exemplary lifestyle then reconciles with his family and inherits their billions... there's a limit to the willful suspension of disbelief.  
 I found the explanations in the book seemed very uneven - some assumed not even an elementary grasp of science, while other parts skipped across wide swaths of info that, to be fully understood by a layman, should have expanded upon in much more detail.  Combine this with the authors' tendency to jump repeatedly and unexpectedly between proselytizing about mythology and other humanistic concepts in hard-to-follow terminology (and, admittedly, I am an engineer, not a liberal arts major, though I'm not an idiot - I did go to MIT) and description/interpretation of scientific facts and theories...made this very difficult reading for me.  I also thought that much of it was preachy and too much time was spent justifying the importance of the premise and the need for the authors' explanations.  It just didn't flow well.  Regardless, the content was good.  I just wish it had been presented in a more streamlined manner.  I was surprised to see all the high ratings.  
 This book was horribly written.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the analogies used... describing the American consumer as Wal-Mart's whores... that was great. However, a lot of the author's claims were highly unsubstantiated.  As a Wal-Mart associate, I know that a lot of what he said is untrue. We are NOT allowed to work off the clock, and we are not victims of Wal-Mart's corporate greed. I really like my job, and while I don't approve of all Wal-Mart's policies, I certainly don't think they're as bad as they are portrayed in this book. I'm sure many of the stories ARE true. However, if the author spent half as much time spotlighting GOOD things Wal-Mart did, this book would be much more balanced.  I'm not impressed by his research, the book is lacking in fact, and is full of baloney. The research he did do could have been much better presented. The book was rambling, he repeated himself constantly, and it just felt like the book was slapped together last minute to be rushed out onto Target shelves.. 
 after get shorty, e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again, with this single-minded purpose focused, e.l. wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty. and he was right again, it was bought and made into a movie again, but pathetically, a horrible one compared to get shorty. the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind. i simply failed to find there's any interest in reading this going nowhere story. it just like reading a double imaged e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie, with all the bore-to-death script, dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap. how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles, especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty'? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose'? and at every corner of los angeles, every table in any restaurant, almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer'? and you have to ask yourself: since when people would recognize a behind-the-screen movie producer, even a director in person? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are? yeah, maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly? and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show? give me a break! this book, from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no-brainer, so shallow and so superficious! just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash-in 
 bestseller -Stupid plot -horrible plot -dumb characters  I have one conculsion Matthew reilly was trying to buy up all the copies of this book to save himself from embrassmen 
 I was wanting more personal bio on these hunky guys.  It was mostly their professional bio.  Interesting but I wanted more personal info like their childhood, families, etc.  
 The book was somewhat useful, but her unprofessional pinching, whenever she could fit it in, littering her otherwise helpful work with jabs against males, left me nauseated after every reading.  Following are just a few examples:  page 23   "You realize what this means--rather than women being "Adam's rib," men are actually the derivative model!"  page 26  "Men have no such luck (or no such constraint, depending on how you look at it)..."  page 63  "Married women have a chronic condition (if you'll excuse the analogy)"  page 122  "[Women] don't buy into the competitive "game" that prevails when men are expressing divergent opinions, and because women are less likely to interrupt, hold the floor, or insist on their opinions, they simply won't volunteer as much information."  page 135  "Although I'm sure it's not true in every category, I think it's safe to say that in most categories, women are more pragmatic than men.  With less interest in the one-upsmanship of novelty, less interest in the inner workings of tech-mech products, and more time pressures than men, women just want products to work easily and reliably."  page 185  "After the meeting, she said to him, 'I was interested to note that you're meeting and greeting--just not with any of the women.'  His response?  'Oh, were there women there?'  She laughed and said, 'Sure there were.  There were 15 or 20 of them.'  Apparently, something in his internal software was registering the women in the room as 'background noise.'"  page 199  "Women are marksmen, not cowboys."  (women are markspeople, if anything; not marksmen; but how is that a comparison anyway?  marksmen and cowboys, marksmen and cowboys.)  page 193  "A guy will talk about how good he is as a way of proving he can do a great job: 'Half of my clients are worth over a million dollars,' he'll say.  Or, 'I doubled his return in six months.'  They talk about achievements, drop names, and let you know where they stand in the company hierarchy.  I call these 'credibility displays,' because they remind me a little of a peacock who's very proud of his tail feathers.  Don't get me wrong--this is the right thing to do in male gender culture." (please tell me I'm the only man who finds this patronizing)  Do read the book though, if you can stomach all the carp.  It will prove enlightening every few dozen pages. 
 not well written or well detailed. Try Graphic Guide to Framing for a much better refrence 
 I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year. I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy. 
 The author missed the point of a quiet life which is that you just do it and enjoy it --- you don't call your friends to do it with you and stop when they cancel.  Another reviewer of Bender's work said that she in "in her head too much" and I completely agree. Stop thinking SO much - just enjoy life - your family. Stop making lists. Stop degrading yourself for the simple process of taking care of yourself, your family and your house. 
 This was no doubt Paul's attempt to equal the great Lennon biography by Ray Coleman, but it falls far short of that impressive tome.  Coleman was a rock journalist who was close enough to his subject to know him but objective enough to be honest about him.  The fact that co-author Barry Miles is a close personal friend of the subject, and not a journalist, makes objectivity a bit sketchy.  Miles shifts from first person witness to omniscient biographer and it's hard telling sometimes which one he is.  Also, easily verifiable facts are grossly misstated.  In one instance he calls TV writer Larry Gelbart, "Larry Geldorf".  Surely an editor should have caught this.  In another instance, Macca himself cites a Lennon quote (from a Mike Douglas show, I believe) from 1975 but attributes it to much earlier.  All in all, it's a sloppy piece of journalism and editing.  It does nothing to raise or secure Paul's reputation.  It comes off, as so many of Paul's attempts to "set the record straight" do, as a petulent attempt at revisionism.  Perhaps if Paul had been more open and less coy from the beginning he wouldn't need to do this.  *This refers to the first edition hardcover 
 I wouldn't highly recomend this book for students who want a quick fact review before the exam. The book would however be good for students who might have trouble writing or organizing essays. The only part of the book I found really helpful was the outline at the back of the book which goes over such things as causes of various wars and famous people. I used that to review the nigh before the exam. But be forwarned if you do buy this bok to help you with the essay it will take you a while to read 
 The cover of this map has the nerve to use the word "extensive." Ha!  This map is seriously lacking in detail. The fold-out maps inside the "Top 10 Hong Kong" book I ordered were *much* more detailed. I don't think I will even bother taking this with me to HK.  A huge waste of money. 
 Book is simplistic. In a word--stun 
 This book is not a Kama Sutra.  There are no illustrations.  The whole purpose of this book is to enhance ones love life.  I personally don't see how this particular book could do it. Men need to see pictures.  It is known in psychology circles that men need visuals 
 Hawthorne Heights is just a horrible and desperate attempt in trying to fit in with the whole emo trend. The lyrics are WAY to simple and pointless. This CD isn't completely horrible, but I would still reccommend that you buy another CD such as:   *Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge - My Chemical Romance *Define The Great Line - Underoath *Liberation Transmission - Lostprophets *Hours - Funeral For A Frien 
 *Welcome to Higby* was a disappointment considering the wit Dunn exhibited in *Ella Minnow Pea*--not that the book didn't have wit; it just didn't have the spark that *Ella* had.  Part of the problem was the writing itself.  Dunn spent a lot of time "head-hopping" in this one.  He drifted from one point-of-view to another.  Not only was this distracting; it was confusing.  I had to reread paragraphs to find who the main player was from one minute to the next.  His theme is beaten to death, as well--everything goes as long as "love" is involved. A minister ignores his son, partly because of his grief over his wife's death and partly because of his work; then he falls "truly in love" with a former prostitute and has sex with her upon their second meeting while his son climbs the Higby water tower for the second time.  Another man falls instantly for a woman who has rear-ended his vehicle.  And another man who has just converted to Christianity--but is still shacked up with his girlfriend due to an imagined "grandfather clause"--decides to bed down with a new flame, then goes back to his girlfriend, making passionate love to her the same day; and then the minister who catches who catches them is made to look ridiculous???  Other types of "love" that are deemed unacceptable by society are gushed over in this book, as well.  What humor is there is pretty run-of-the-mill (for example, a bumbling policeman, an adorable older man bordering on senility).    Little new; little original; little reason to read it 
 There are serious inaccuracies in this book that can cause a great deal of stress for a celiac. The section on medications with gluten is especially troubling as it causes someone who thought they were safe to worry for no reason. Most troubling is her treatment of the risks of cancer. Her treatment is both superficial, incaccurate and unrealistic. First she says that the risk is the same whether you maintain a gluten free diet or not. Then she says that the only thing you can do about it is to not worry about it. Her discussion of picking food out of a sandwiches is poor advice. In one section she understands the problems of cross contamination, yet doesn't seem to understand that picking apart food is more of a risk than using a toaster. Finally, her flip advice about how to avoid answering questions is ridiculous. Why not be honest instead of avoiding the questions. It's up to the person as to how many details they want to give. But avoiding the issue is not the answer.  
 I'll devour anything about European travel, but Samantha Brown is a bit too perky and silly for my tastes. I can get over that, but what really ruins this show is her silly obsession about the hotel she stays at in each episode. You've got 20 minutes to tell me about Paris, or London, or Amsterdam, and you're wasting 5 of those minutes on a single expensive hotel? Seriously? That's not what travel is all about, sorry. Otherwise, a decent production. Too bad she's a hotel industry shill. (And she is: Her Great Hotels series is sponsored by the hotels she vists. Guess who foots the bill? 
 Writing rebuttals on the review section for your own book?  Classy Ed!  Can't your compilation of "freedom" stories stand on its own 
 This is a reprint of a bunch of Ms. Galasso-Vigorito's columns. I find the appearance of her column every Monday in our local paper (she started out her column here in New Haven)really annoying. Her writing has all the psychological and theological depth of a cheap greeting card. Her columns are all very wordy, but they basically recycle three sentences: "God will get us through", "The world is beautiful" and "Let's be nice to one another".  The shallowness of her approach is really irritating. She quotes freely from the Bible, but selectively avoids anything that might be challenging or tough. Around Easter time, for example, she talks about the glorious Easter morn, etc., but purposely avoids Good Friday. Nothing as messy as the Crucifixion enters Catherine's strawberries-and-butterflies universe.   This, in my opinion, does a disservice to her readers. Christianity is frequently about hearing things we don't to want to, but need to, hear -- about redemption through suffering, about making moral choices, about committment. By ignoring this and replacing it with cotton candy platitudes, faith is reduced to a "feel good" attitude which is ultimately false and self-delusional -- more "New Age" than Christian. "Soothing", by Catherine's defintion, is more like "Anesthetizing", which is just plain escapism, not faith.  There are hundreds of Christian writers that offer more depth than this one. Don't waste time or money with this book. 
 Well...its wood...its hard to clean...but I knew that going into it!!  wont do it again 
 Music Girl Sam's review is well put.  As an actual connoisseur of music (My hd has 14,000 songs on it and my box in my basement still has 300 cds I haven't burned to my computer yet.) I'd have to say that this group is nothing more than a great high school band.  Yes their sound is more polished and studio-ized than the average garage CD, but the lyrics and the overall generic pop-rock group style like it was conjured up by someone of the maturity of a teenager.  That being said, maybe they will have a better second effort since they obviously know how to play instruments and sing.  All they need is someone to write the songs for them.    I personally fell into the trap of hearing one song, then checking the reviews on Amazon and letting that be enough.  I guess I should have known that when the New CDs are only .90 then there's probably something up.  My recommendation is to download "Statue" and skip the rest of the CD.  Most of the lyrics couldn't be more clichï¿½'d and when they aren't they sound just plain silly.  I mean check these out from  "Nikki Don't Stop" (track 11):  Hotter than a Puerto Rican mama, suckin' on ice in a sauna,  Hotter than a little cheerleader, throwin' back cheap tequila,  Hotter than a stolen rolex, hotter than late night phone sex,  Hotter than the back seat of a black jeep on a back street  If you think these lyrics either make sense or actually took an intelligent person to write them, then you still aren't tall enough to ride the rides at Kings Island.  I'd give this CD 2 stars, but because so many people gave them 5 I have to give them less to bring down the rating in attempt to save people like myself that got duped into buying this studio album.  Buy Teddy Geiger before you buy this or The Fray or Snow Patrol or virtually anything else along those lines before you waste your money on this 
 some great content here, and I didn't expect great video quality, but the DVDs themselves are in terrible shape, like they were just burned on a bad computer. Several titles skip and hang so badly they won't play at all. Too bad, as there's some great stuff I'd love to see on here 
 I often find that books that try to be two things at once don't really make it as either, and this is a case in point.  I thought it might be a book ABOUT the Mutter Museum and the exhibits there, but it's not really, it's a book of artsy photographs that happen to be taken at the museum.  However, it then includes bits and pieces of medicine and medical history, but never enough to really give you any perspective or answer questions you might have about the pictures.  There is a section at the end that is straight writing without photos, but it's ALSO a muddled mess---a thrown together hodge-podge of history and only one, for some reason, case study.  I don't think the medical information was that well edited, as I read with surprise that now babies born as early as the 3rd month of gestation can survive outside the womb!  Wow!  I bet that will be news to many OB/GYNs!  Maybe I don't know enough about art photography, but I found the photos underwhelming.  Many were not really focused.  There were often more than one of the same exhibit, from different angles, and for some reason in different places in the book.  The most jarring photos to me were not the sad ones of horrible deformities but the ones with the dogs of William Wegman posing with such things as a preserved diseased foot.  WHY?  I felt it was really a blow to the dignity of the people that gave their body parts to science.  The best part of the book to me was the older photos, taken in the 19th century, which gave dignity to their subjects, and the pictures of wax models.  They were so much more straightforward and clear than the other photos.  Overall, not worth the money.  I hope someone at some point does a different book about this museum 
 As I read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by Mr. Cussler, the story was slow and the plot was transparent.     This book just didn't have the "zing" of the older Cussler stories.  If you are just laying around with nothing else to do it will give you something to read 
 Back in the '90s,the Dave Matthews Band was considered the next Grateful Dead,with Dave Matthews as its clean-shaven Jerry Garcia.In my college days,the DMB was praised for blending world music,jazz&rock.It was The Next Big Thing.There were Daveheads.But then came "Everyday" produced by Glen Ballard (who also produced Alanis Morrissette's music),which was seen as a sell-out.  "Stand up" was the last gasp.When this album was released,a local Bay Area radio station was mocking the DMB as "annoying"&saying that having the ubiquitous Black Eyed Peas (who are now collaborating with Sergio Mendes&Michael Jackson)open for them made the DMB "doubly annoying."  This album has a few highlights- 1)American Baby,intro&song-Despite the use of the African kora (harp),this song sounds Asian with its pentatonic scale.It's quite electrifying.It's danceable&shows the brilliance the DMB once had.It's powerful in the use of acoustic instrumental music,like REM's "Losing my religion." 2)Louisiana Bayou-Very jazzy,you could say it evokes the New Orleans sound.Again,the DMB plays to its strengths. 3)Finest Hour-This song is catchy despite Dave Matthews' politics.Great as a song,not great as a protest song. 4)Out of my hands-Reflective with the use of piano,like REM's "Nightswimming."  Can the DMB make a comeback?It's hard to tell.In a decade,they've managed to go from being the Next Big Thing to Has Beens."Stand up" made the mistake of being produced by an R&B/hip-hop producer who tried to make the DMB sound like any other group.DMB isn't 50 Cent;it isn't Justin Timberlake.Whether the DMB returns to form remains to be seen 
 "In Good Company" goes on and on at the end a little bit, and the ending especially is not fulfilling character/plot-wise.  If it had ended 15-20 minutes before it actually did, I would give it three stars instead of two.  I admit there were quite a few times when I laughed a bit to myself, but it didn't make me fall off the couch or anything. There were other times when I thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced.  Overall it isn't an entirely bad movie, but, like I said, the ending is unfulfilling.  Overall not strong performances coming from Scarlett Johansson or Topher Grace 
 James is a great literary virtuoso, in certain ways the most sophisticated and complex America has had. His intricate intelligence is complemented by an unequaled descriptive power, and a mastery of language, second to none. How difficult then to come across the passage which ruins this book for me. This is James description of the immigrant Jews on the East Side.It is the observation of the sterile aristrocatic owner of Anglo-Saxon civilization who looks with contempt and horror at the poor swarming sweatshop crowd threatening to steal his private inheritance from him.  
 do not like this product it is very hard to get rail under bed  pops out of rails track and it is sooo hard to get back in trac 
 This was the worst book I have ever read.  It was so boring.  I have never spent so much money on such a stupid book!! I can't believe that anyone would say that they liked this book!! And I really wouldn't recomend anyone else buying or reading it! 
 Ordered this book and was all excited waiting for it to come; figured it was right up my alley. When it arrived and I looked inside I knew when I saw the map that it was about area like Yuma, Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso. The HOT areas of the Southwest. Well, there's a lot of the Southwest that is high and cold and this book is for the low, hot areas. If you live within site of the Colorado mountains as I do in the Four Corners, this book will be of no use at all. Too bad I was given no hint about that and now have to deal with the hassle of a return and pay for it too!  Should have called it something like "Low Desert Gardening" or something.. 
 Yeah, it may be based on a true story.  So what?  That don't make it a good movie, and man oh man, it ain't good at all.  Oooohhh....blue lightning striking.  That's real scary stuff.  Now I know Barbara Hershey can act, and she did what she could with this script, which would have been better used as a doormat.  The doctors, and especially Silver, were so over the top clueless and cliche it was insulting.  Tell me about your father....yeah, right.  Kids were annoying, whiny things and that son was such a rube, albeit a loyal one.  The theme and subject matter are strong and heavy stuff, and this could have worked.  Failed miserably for me though.  Worst ending for a horror flick not just of the era, but for all time.  The mingling of science and horror rarely works, except the Lovecraft flicks and a few others.  The students that came to her house were such dopey flops I couldn't stand it.  That old guy she was sleeping with could've been her grandfather.  What a joke, man.  The attack and rape scenes were pretty physical, brutal and believable, though.  Gotta admit that.  The blue lightning ruined any authenticity, and the freezing of the creature in the end was just lame.  Her friends were kind of stooges, too.  The 2 stars are for the scenes when she was getting attacked and the one where she was violated while she slept.  By the way, who sleeps through sex?  This was a bad movie based on the story of some west coast crackpot who needed attention. Get The Exorcist or Poltergeist and forget this one.  Felt I had to warn potential buyers, as all the reviews on this are positive for some inexplicable reason.  Be honest and be discriminating.  Worth the price if the price is just a few bucks.  Would have enjoyed a scene where The Entity went after Ron Silver 
 The author of this book seems to have hit upon an interesting structuring of American history, but fails to provide much in the way of new analysis or interesting predictions.  I felt as if the entire book was an  introduction and prelude to an argument that would actually say something  productive.  The constant repetition of incomes and health statistics  simply confirm the common sense conlusion about where we have gone with  material prosperity without providing any real insight into the state of  the Union today, or where we can or will go in the future.  We will be  healthier and richer, with a greater portion of our income spent on higher  education in coming years.  Swell.  Tell us something a fifth grader  couldn't predict.  I suppose it does give some valuable context to current  issues concerning egalitarianism, but wait for the paper-back.  The work is  anything but "bold".  Disappointing is a more appropriate  description 
   I give it 5 stars for being "complete" (i.e., The idea of having services for every holiday and every day of the week in one volume is wonderful). Ultimately, however, I give it 2 stars because: This paperback edition is totally useless to me. If you need reading glasses and are thinking of ordering The COMPLETE ARTSCROLL SIDDUR (paperback edition), make sure to visit your eye doctor and get those bifocals before this book arrives!  The description of this ARTSCROLL edition uses words like "clear"...and "crisp type..."... but it is only clear and crisp if you can read miniature words or you have young eyes that haven't gone through "the change" yet!  
 I now know why I had not heard much about this movie.  Only buy it if you like Broadway musicals because it is not your typical Doris Day movie.  I feel like I am watching parts of Monty Python and the Holy Grail when the prince says "I just want to sing" 
 I always hate doing this to an author but I almost didn't finish this book due to it's dryness. Avoide this outline 
 This book is so general  that even someone who has never fished would know more already. Some of the information is inaccurate and/or not up to date. The auther has not been even been fishing for what I think is a long time.  He even admits to getting a lot of his info from guides and charters. In fact he talks a lot about all the fish he has cought on the charters and trips he's been on. Anyone can catch fish on a charter. I hope the For Dummies book are not going to all be like this from now on because they are normally very good 
 This textbook is horrible!  It makes relatively easy statistical concepts unbearably confusing and over-complicated.  I used this textbook for a graduate-level class, yet found myself constantly referring to my statistics notes from undergraduate classes--which I think is pretty sad.  The only reason this text got more than one star is due to the many tables and charts listed in the back.  They were the one semi-decent portion of the book.  Caveat Emptor--Buyer Beware 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 The real problem of our time isn't what a terrorist believes, it's what he or she is capable of doing. A band of a few hundred or thousand terrorists can keep the entire world hostage if they are determined enough to seek, procure and use biological or nuclear WMD. Their justifications don't matter that much at all.   This book argues that Al Quaeda's justifications somehow do matter; that they seeks to kills us (the west) for what we do instead of for what we believe in. Understanding what a group of murderous zealots may or may not be motivated by is important only because in understanding them we can more easily attempt to inhibit them. But the author insists it does matter for determining policy alternatives and he goes on to suggest that if we can't destroy Al Quaeda in al all out war we should consider trading in Israel's security and handing over the Arab world to Islamist instead of to Nationalist usurpers.  The problem with the arguments in this book is that they're too emotional; at many times one feels here is someone who is upset with the direction the war on terror has taken and feels his (minority) viewpoint within the CIA has been ignored, he has a 20 year long grump to express. He admits that his editor felt obliged to edit out many of the cynical barbs and yet plenty remain.   Some of the points raised in this book are a stretch. Bin Laden's targets (The Great Satan and Israel) are dramatic abstractions to ordinary Muslims. The idea that it is justifiable to kill nonbelievers because they happen to be from Israel or the US (or Denmark for that matter) is not widely held at all. The author argues that vast numbers of Muslims are siding with Bin Laden's Jihad because it is their Muslim duty to protect the holy places from the infidels. That is nuts. The bible calls for Christians to stone the adulterers too, doesn't mean that any Christian in their right mind is actually going to do so. The author doesn't seem to have any feeling with 'reality' or 'the Muslim street'. His extremist notions are dangerous, if we were to wage the all out war vs Muslim extremism that he suggests we'd be seeing a revolution in Pakistan that could and probably would arm the faithful with nukes.   He suggests two such nutty extremist alternatives: declare an all out war on islamic fundamentalism or seek a Munich-like compromise. But the war hasn't been lost; in Afghanistan the coalition has denied Al Quaeda their primary base of operations. In Iraq the whole Muslim world watched in perplexity and often delight as the Great Satan organized the first free elections there ever. While it's too early to claim the coalition is winning the war on terror, it certainly isn't being lost.  The author's compromise alternative isn't realistic either. Western support for Israel isn't a tactical decision, it has always been about protecting the Jews against forces that seek their extinction; one cannot disregard what happened in 1948 and how bad the 650.000 Palestinian Arab and how good the 850.000 Jewish Arab refugees were treated by their own people. One has to realize that the only Arabs that have democratic rights in the Middle East are the Israeli Arabs. One has to take into account how Arab regimes treat dissent (Hama, Syria, 1982) compared to how Israel handles it. Support for Israel in the west isn't a result of excellent Israeli propaganda, it's there for the same reason that the US maintained troops in Europe after WWII; it is supranational solidarity between those who hold similar values. Only armchair philosophers like the author are too jaded to see the validity of that argument.  One can picture the author sitting as a grumpy analyst at a CIA conference table, bitterly contesting the majority view. He himself admits he's not a hands on type of person, his views are scholarly and not very well honed by personal experience. That's obvious from this book. It's a bestseller only by virtue of making the Bush administration look incompetent.  The Bush administration doesn't need any help there. Some of the criticism is deserved; why go after Iraq? Why suddenly try the kind of social engineering (implant democracy) that conservatives have always decried? Certainly it was brave to try to bring democracy to a people who have suffered so long under various dictatorships and certainly those who understand the gesture (the Kurds) fully appreciate America's intent. But democracy doesn't work when there's no large educated middle class that wants democracy and the rule of law.   We might be loosing the propaganda war for not understanding the romantic appeal of the lone religiously inspired warriors going against the huge a secular empire. Bin Laden is a hero like Che Guevara was one, a romantic with juvenile anti-establisment passions, that's why he's popular. He is winning that battle over the Muslim hearts and minds, and the western world plays right into his hand by trying to present a vast unified goliath force instead of being true to the its diverse, opinionated, free and openly  multicultural nature. We can't murder millions to kill a few, we can't sell out our friends.

 Fischer's attempts to analyze the influence of regional British folkways in colonial America holds much promise. Sadly, he uses, however, a simplistic and often contradictory interpretive methodology.     Much of his information on such vague topics as "freedom" ways is anctedotal. His maps of regional origins for colonists tend to contradict his findings. A case in point is his analysis of the so-called Cavalier society of Virginia. His map indicates a substantial Welsh component to the servant population. The Welsh, like the Irish and the Scots, are either ignored altogether or given cursory attention in the creation of a Tuckahoe [i.e. Virginian] identity. Admittedly, the English did dominate Virginia numerically, the contributions of the latter, however, particularly in the Northern Neck cannot be underestimated. The contribution of Northern English, the primary creators of Fischer's fourth folkway, to the Chesapeake population is also an issue that raises problems for Fischer's analysis as does the contribution of West Countrymen to New England.        In his analysis of backcountry folkways he relies heavily on McWhiney's "Cracker Culture," a particularly problematic book, and McDonald and McWhiney's Celtic theory of Southern culture and the so-called Highland zone theory of British history. Fischer ignores the contribution of low country white immigrants from Virginia and Pennsylvania Quakers to the the formation of Appalachian culture, not to mention the Germans. The Germans, in particular, may have contributed to the pastoral agricultural traditions of the Southern Appalachians. Finally, the role of African Americans in the formation of Southern society is never adequately explored.      Also, some of the information he employs in presenting his case about the so-called North Britons in the Backcountry is drawn from William Byrd's History of the Dividing Line. The individuals encountered by Byrd were infact drawn from Culture Number 2. Because Byrd's expedition through the Southside of Virginia pre-dated the later arrival of Scots-Irish and other PA settlers in places like Lunenberg or Mecklenberg county.      As a native of the Shenandoah Valley, and a product of cultures number 2 and 4, I personally found this premise fascinating. The English, because of their numbers and historical position in American culture, tend to be ignored as an ethnic group. So in this regard, Fischer's premise is sound, in the exploration of the ethno-cultural contributions of English folk cultures to American regionalism. Fischer's introductory descriptions of the environments encountered by the colonists is another example of promise not kept, when he downplays the role of creolization and adaptation to the new environment. But the broad generalizations Fischer employs detracts from the final product.      I was pleasantly surprised by Fischer's second book "Bound Away." For individuals interested in the process, in particular, by which Englishmen became Virginians I would recommend: 1. Alan Kulikoff's article "The Colonial Chesapeake: Seedbed of Antebellum Southern Culture?'"Journal of Southern History, 45 (1979), 513-40.  2. Alan Kulikoff's "Tobacco and Slaves" (1986). 3. Terry Jordon-Bychkov, "The Upland South: The Making of an American Folk Region and Landscape." I have problems with Jordan-Bychkov's Finnish contribution theory and the number of Upper Souther "mestizos" that the author posits. But the author maintains the traditional 3-part theory of John C. Campbell about Appalachian origins, namely: "Scots-Irish," Virginian/Carolinian [i.e. lowland whites] and Swiss-German.  4.Elizabeth A. Perkins and John Dabney Shane, "Border Life: Experience and Memory in the Revolutionary Ohio Valley" A fascinating account of one of the first frontiers where individuals from the different "regions," in particular cultures number 2 and 4 came together.  On the positive side I would recommend his analysis of child-rearing techniques. In particular his analysis of the so-called "will bending" as practised in Virginia. According to Fischer Virginians raised their sons to be both independent, assertive males, yet at the same time kept them economically and emotionally bound to their fathers. In this world daughters were taught to be submissive. Yet, as Fischer shows, Virginian daughters did not always conform to this social paradigm and with the sons this created an emotional paradox that had strong social implications. In this one example it is possible to see the way in which Fischer weaves together Anthropological and Historical methodology seamlessly.  In general the book is very readable and Fischer's arguments, whether you agree with them or not, are not hard to discern.   
 It's TM for golfers with a Scotish accent.  Can't believe this book has a following 
 Washed them once (before using) and now they look really old. They have loose threads hanging out in several places and have small balls all over them.  I am not impressed. Would not buy again 
 The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read.  Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions.  This CD totally KILLS that.  First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.  And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book!  While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs 
 I just got my copy of the DVD R-Rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing. Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!!   Unsatisfied customer 
 On the cover of this fine book is a blurb from the NY Times saying "If you have only enough money for one DTP book, buy this one," paraphrased, of course. The emphasis should be if you only have ONE. If you have any of Robin Williams' books or a Classroom in a Book, Parker's book will only be a re-hash of that. So, if you don't have a good DTP book, this is the book for you. If you have anyother reasonably good DTP book, this will just be the same stuff 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 I was excited to see another CD from Gladys Knight but this is not what I expected. Usually Gladys portrays feeling and emotion in her renditions.  This CD is flat and unemotional.  If she is thankful to those before her for their songs she doesn't show it. I thought she would take great songs and make them her own as much as she could but there is no depth.  It is as if she is reading a telephone book.  I like Gladys but this is not a CD,if you like her too, to purchase. I am disappointed because I know she could do better. I wish she did 
 Well, This dvd is pretty bad, like everyone else said. It's 4 episodes recapping the previous 14, with narration from each character in the background. I believe they had to make these eps due to the fact that they needed to save some money in japan since they weren't getting high ratings on the anime series. Anyway, I didn't buy this dvd, because I have the japanese box set instead, which saved me a lot of $$. I watched each episode, and I must say the only part I liked was the opening and ending theme. Other than that, there really is no need to buy this dvd unless you are truly a die-hard wolf's rain fan. But, don't be surprised if you watch this dvd for 5 minutes and then throw it out the window. I really highly recommend renting this before you buy it, cause otherwise you are wasting your money 
 I've had the AT-PL120 turntable for about a month. It worked relatively well with the included cartrdge. There was some minor hum but it was only noticable with my receiver's volume up very loud with no record playing. I tried installing a Sure M78S cartridge for playing 78 rpm records and the problems started. There was noticable hum even when playing records. I also installed an Audio-Technica AT440MLa Cartridge. This cartridge gets very good reviews from audio weenies. The hum was outrageous from the second I turned the thing on. The cartridge works fine in my brother's old Kenwood direct-drive unit. I tried using the turntable with the internal preamp and with the one in my receiver as well as connecting directly to my Mac for CD burning. The problem persists. The unit will be going back tomorrow. Very Disappointing 
 If I could I would give this movie -92 stars, for each minute of my life I wasted on it. Such a disappointment for fans of the original Starship Troopers. It pretty much comes down to being a bad slasher movie. The only decent special effects scene was RECYCLED from the first Starship Troopers. The first scene in the movie is comical it is so bad. For fans of the first Starship Troopers who are curious about this movie I'm saving you the suspense and valuable hour and a half of your life. 
 No matter who is in the cast, it would be hard to outshine the Peter O'Toole/Katherine Hepburn "Lion in Winter" -- even if Hepburn is Hepburn as always.    This new version comes nowhere near.  Visually it's somewhat better -- the detail on costumes, props, and sets is fascinating.  But poor Patrick Stewart, poor Glenn Close (who I normally adore!), poor cast -- abysmal.  The three princes are awful, and Jonathan Rys-Myers -- well, he should have passed on this one.  He's very talented, but it doesn't show here.  I have to confess I didn't even finish watching it.  It just doesn't work.  This is another remake that should never have been remade!  
 Great cd. Imus in the morning recommended highly and the I-man was not wrong. One of the best cd's I've owned in years. I listen to a lot of Buffett, James Taylor, Delbert McClinton, and this cd places high in these ranks 
 This book is poorly organized.  The photos are not labeled.  There is an exploded view of sidepull brakes but no photo or diagram of the actual brakes and what they look like put together. There is a photo of different bikes but the labels are all black so sometimes it's hard to identify what the pointer is actually pointing to.  I'm very disappointed because I just wanted to adjust sidepull and cantilever brakes and I can't figure it out from this book.  I really can't tell much from the photos. I am very disappointed.  I thought the revised edition would be better 
 Every review on this item so far sums up exactly what happens with this item.I wish I would have read their reviews before ordering this item.Sorry I could not give it less than one star. I think Smithsonian should refund everyone's purchase price 
 I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman 
 Most of the frugal tips in this book are really quite obvious to anyone with any financial sense.  There is nothing new or revolutionary about what the author is saying and most of her suggestions fall into the basic financial planning category.  She also repeats herself constantly.  The book could have been about half as long if she didn't rehash the same points over and over.  This is not a good book if you are serious about finding ways to save money.  The religious overtones throughout the book are a bit offensive, as well. 
 The content of this book is only common sense steps... and targeted for completely disorganized people. For those using their brain before acting, do not buy this book: you won't find any secret, nor precious tips. But if you're a teen and wonder how to start a consulting business in the future: it could be a good investment. I bought the ebook edition, at least I didn't waste paper... Alan Weiss should learn more Japanese, because the word "sogomi" (at page 8!) doesn't exist. This mistake gives you the level of this book 
 I am so disappointed. Continuing to sell/publish this book is irresponsible.  As two recent reviews have noted, the recipes are full of ONIONS and, occasionally, GARLIC, both toxic to cats (onions can cause Heinz's Anemia). One other review wrote that the onions were confined to the "people food" section of the book, but this is not true. There are onions everywhere. I agree that this book cannot possibly be vet approved, and I intend to do some research into the guy, a vet, who wrote the preface. His Latin is fake, and so, to my great disappointment, is the potential security and well being proffered by these recipes. I am going to return the book. Even if one leaves the garlic out, can one really trust that the author's nutrional advice is sound ? With great disappointment, I recommend that you stay far away from this book, even though the illustrations are charming 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 While the underlying plot had potential, the story dies under its own weight.  There are too many characters (the first hint of trouble is the multi-page listing of characters at the front of the book).  This leads to too little time devoted to character development and too much bouncing around as we follow the many characters around the globe.  The dialog, is terse, contrived, choppy and generally devoid of emotion.  Having loved the Dirk Pitt and Brad Austin line of books from Cussler, I had wanted to like the Oregon Files as well.  Unfortunately, I found Sacred Stone and Golden Buddha to both be underwhelming.  
 These are not houses that people would build. I was very disappointed in this book. The houses pictured were only the weird modern type that most people wouldn't build. We don't want to build a standard boring "production" home but these were just too far out there 
 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 Man, these guys suck. I couldn't stand listening to the 30 second samples. Click out of this page and move on with your life 
 I love Linda Howard, but I didn't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying!  The heroine was a whiny martyr--she drove me crazy!  And where was the suspense?  I truly can't believe that people liked this book!  If you want to read a good Linda Howard book, read "Mr. Perfect" or "Dying to Please" 
 As a fan of historical mysteries, I was looking forward to starting this popular series.  I was deeply disappointed.  First of all, the character of Amelia Peabody is not appealing, and through her the author reveals that she has only a very superficial understanding of Victorian values and thinking.  (Although if you don't mind an author sticking a character with modern sensibilities in period dress, maybe this is for you.)  Furthermore, the mystery was simply not that interesting.  I found myself reading only to finish the book, for I had little interest in finding out who committed the murders. The success of this series and the acclaim the author has received truly baffle me 
 I got this book based on the overall good rating it got and the fact that I like romantic supsense type of books. This one, however, didn't make the mark. The romance portion was barely there and seemed far-fetched. And I wasn't the least bit afraid while reading this book. No good suspense factor for me. I also found that I could put this book down for long periods of time and not be compelled to pick it up again. All in all, I found it to be a waste of my time...I don't think I would try to read another book by this author again 
 Liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money. Thought it'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else. But instead i've paid and never received it. I haven't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else, so this is the first chance i've had to even say i've been ripped off. They may eventually send it but it's not likely at this point, it's been a couple months now 
 Without the strong leading performances of Donald Pleasance or Jaime Lee Curtis (only in this for about 10 minutes) this makes it the worst Halloween film to date. Much has been said about Halloween 4-6. I loved Halloween 4 & 5 and 6 was just okay however Danielle Harris should have been in that one as well. The series picked up again with Halloween: H20 but took another fall with this cheap piece of trash that was just looking to make a quick buck. I would watch Halloween III which doesn't even have the Michael Myers character in it as long as it meant I wouldn't have to be subjected to this again. The actors (acting) were terrible, the plot and storyline was severely weak, and the entire film as a whole just seemed fake and pointless. It's really a shame when a franchise has to be ruined with something like this (I felt the same with Jason X which is set in space). Lame. I'm pretending this one never happened. 
 This novel was unfinished and needed some cleaning up.  We never learn how he comes to leave Robinson and Delamarche, for instance, or whatever becomes of his money the manageress is holding for him. It is obvious that the work was not ready for publication.  That said, for those who are interested in reading Kafka the book is light and amusing at times.  But overall, the situations Karl finds himself in are often frustratingly impossible and the characters are not well developed.  Karl, the main character makes an excellent argument for the Stoker in Chapter One, but can't seem to find words for his own defense at the Hotel. There are enough inconsistancies to drive an analytical reader crazy and probably Kafka wouldn't have allowed publication in this unfinished form 
 This is a pretty good read by an exceedingly arrogant businessman who seems more often than not to forget that he failed and, moreover, is clueless why.  His knowledge of business is about 50th percentile.  His knowledge of government is at best 10th.  Lots of 50thth percentile businesspeople make it.  If you're naive about government - as Mr Kaplan surely was - about the best you can do is whine about that mean old Bill Gates while your company goes belly up.  Read it and weep -- or laugh 
 I gave the record two stars because the guitar playing is decent. Other than that this thing doesn't have much going for it. The songs all sound similar and no effort was put into creating decent lyrics. If Soma were music, there's a good chance it would sound very similar to this album 
 While this book is not an utter garbage, there's nothing remarkable about it either, at least in my opinion. There's a certain wit and charm to "Fat Girls...", but that in itself doesn't save it from being mediocre. Even though miss Peck says that she's not a professional writer, by any means, it still feels as if though you need be a part of her family in order to enjoy this book. There's no humor in here, despite whatever reviews are saying - its just a number of observations on life, good ones at that, but I was looking for something else.  Bonus points for an excellent books cover. 
 Let me start off by saying that if you haven't read any of Gerritsen's books featuring her two main characters, don't even consider reading this book. So much about the characters deeply depends on your being familiar with their history. Even if you have read other books with these characters, The Mephisto Club, while starting off with a lot of suspense, is a disappointment. The plot drags and requires you to suspend belief way too much, there are too many subplots that are left dangling, and the ending -- what there is of one -- is weak and unsatisfying. All in all, I'd advise you to skip The Mephisto Club. Your time and money are too valuable to spend on a book that, at best, is mediocre 
 bestseller -Stupid plot -horrible plot -dumb characters  I have one conculsion Matthew reilly was trying to buy up all the copies of this book to save himself from embrassmen 
 OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics 
 Like all James Patterson's books, this was a good story idea, but poorly executed. Patterson's characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever, but the dialog runs from awkward to silly, and his pacing is often confusing and forced. That's why his books do better as movies: a better writer gets to use Patterson's concepts with more realistic dialog and good pacing 
 reasons I wouldn't go with this book:  1. poor pedagogy, i.e., easy examples, but unsolvable problems 2. not necessarily very up-to-date, lacking in innovation, extremely old-fashioned 3. there are surely better written books on Circuits out there    e.g.: Alexander&Sadiku (which is an easy but great read), or Dorf (which is pretty decent 
 Although not a blockbuster in terms of new, new-age material, I found this book enjoyable in spurts.  I do like the material on the mind-body connection.  Otherwise, the Yoga exercises described are pretty much cut and dried.  Would I buy this book if I knew its' contents? No.  It takes a lot for me to purchase a book that I cannot find at my local library or one that I 'must have'.  Unless you're a newcomer to the world of alternative health, this book is rehashed and remarketed material 
 I will not deny that Elliott Sober's work is illuminating and comprehensive. What concerns me is that his book is not one on the philosophy of biology. Rather, it is a work on the philosophy of evolutionary theory.   Within it's own scope it's fine, although potential buyers should note that there are much better introductions to the subject (see Mayr 1988, 1999 or 2004, Rosenberg 1985, and Sober's anthology: 'Conceptual Issues in Evolutionary Biology'). In addition, Sober's philosophical background makes his writing style unnecessarily complicated, often attempting to impress the reader making irrelevant comparisons and references.   What is most unfortunate is his choice of title. This book does not in any way represent or exemplify the current concerns of the practicing biologist. Sober ignores most areas of biology as if they didn't exist, focusing solely on evolution. Books like this one really harm the discipline of philosophy of biology, as they make the public think that this exciting new discipline can be effectively reduced to the study of evolutionary theory. As a biologist myself, I doubt that more than 5% of all practicing biologists are engaged in traditional evolutionary studies. Since the 1960s, the emphasis has been on the molecular aspect of life, and the philosophy of biology should similarly attempt to address issues arising from molecular concepts and research. A few books have been written that emphasise the molecular and experimental aspect that defines modern biology. See for example Weber's Philosophy of Experimental Biology (2005), or Sarkar's 'Molecular Models of Life'.   For those looking for a general introduction to the philosophy of biology, I would recommend Sterelny and Griffiths' (1999) 'Sex and Death' since it successfully covers a very wide range of biological topics, not just evolution. Books like Sober's 'Philosophy of Biology' are misleading both in their content and in their approach to the subject. 
 i've been a NIN fin since spring 1990.  PHM, broken and TDS are absolutely pure genius.  but unfortunately NIN is dead.  this song is terrible and remix worse 
 I thought this book was simply disgusting.  I felt so ashamed being in a bookstore looking into this book.  Many times I felt so nauseated looking at it that I had to put it down.  It is a shameful book, and I think it is more shameful that these young men should parade their bodies that way.  This is what they call art? Originally I did not want to rate the book at all because it does not deserve not even one star, but I had no choice but to rate it.  Amazon should give one the choice to give it a "0" rating if one feels that the book is really bad.  I don't recommend this fetid book to anyone 
 I'm usually a sucker for just about any kooky theories backed up by barely-there evidence. Even trying very hard to be generous (hey, I'm a Christian and I think it would be fabulous if the stuff in this book were true), I think I could poke a hole in every page. And that's after perhaps 12 months of formal Mandarin study and a similar amount of Cantonese.  Don't buy it. It's embarrassing to Christians that this sort of thing gets passed around as scholarship. If they'd wrapped it up with a plot around it, it'd make a great work of fiction 
 I am a Time person of the year 2003 (shared title - actively deployed U.S. servicemembers).  I must say that reading Time magazine is like reading the platform for the Democratic Party.  Actually it is even worse than that it is like reading John Dean's diary, filled more with fantasy and personal wishes than actual reality.  One of the latest from the online edition is that Realists have taken over Washington.  Give me a break.  A new set of hogs have come in to take over at the troff and that is it.  Anyone who believes Nancy Pelosi and her gang of political hacks is going to help America is a fool.  Best thing we can hope for is that they create so much gridlock that no one can spend any money in Washington.  Maybe then they will see that America improves on its own and politicians on both side make things awful.  The sad thing is that people that read this publication actually think they walk away knowing something about the world.  This publication is so biased that it not only misinforms its readers it makes them look like fools when they try to repeat what they have "learned".  If you want a truly useful weekly news publication then subscribe to the Economist.  It probably will not change your political affiliations but it will at least make you sound competent when you debate others.  The Economist is quite simply the best weekly news magazine in existence.  The articles are well written by people that know what they are talking about.  Leaders from around the world read and contribute to the Economist.  This is something that Time, Newsweek and the rest of their ilk cannot claim.  I am not affiliated with any political parties and do not consider myself political.  I look at things from an economic perspective and vote accordingly 
 I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty  sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist 
 I had not read Danielle Steel in several years.  I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable.  I was very disappointed with this work 
 I suffered, and I DO mean suffered, through this atrocity only for the sake of seeing Jeffrey Wright. This movie was horrible - save Jeffrey's scenes - from beginning to the who-knows-what-happened or who cared ending! Ugh. What a waste of 90 minutes of your life. Stay far, far away from this mess. Not only do you not care who the killer is, all you do is sit and pray for it to be over. And, I like Stallone 
 If you are interested in reading a bunch of ignorant, bigoted stereo types, by all means buy this book. Robert Tallant was not a writer to bother with facts when spewing his hatred and racism. His depictions of New Orleans Voodoo and it's practitioners are dead wrong. If you want to read about New Orleans Voodoo, try Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau by Martha Ward. 
  It sounded like an intresting book; murder,speaking from the dead, but as the story unfolded I realized I was reading a adolesent romance novel.ugh 
 While the information in here was of some value, I found that other books that I have on this subject are more indepth.  The market info was no use because it was very outdated 
 I watched this because it has Big Gipp from the Goodie Mobb in it.  That is the high point, the movie is not very good.  If your a Goodie Mobb fan rent it just out of curiosity.  If not stay away from this one 
 The first 90% of the book is an unevenly written 2000 year chronology of the city. The chapters proceed from pre-Roman to modern times. This makes it very difficult to find information from different eras on specific landmarks. The style is also very dry. My point is that the information isn't presented in a way that a traveller would want to access it--'I'm in Place de la Concorde--what's happened here over the centuries?' Other books I've read like this will take you through suggested walks in different neighborhoods talking about their history e.g. 'Turn left down this street and you're looking at Napolean's house etc...' The book also ignores or barely mentions the historical basis for many popular characters of Paris historical fiction. The musketeers get half a sentance and Victor Hugo's stories don't fare much better. The last 10% attempts to give some more detailed information about Notre Dame and a couple other landmarks but it's too little, too late. I did learn a lot of interesting material about the city. But I would recommend spending your time with a Parisian's memoir or work of fiction based in Paris. I think you would get much more enjoyment for your investment 
 let me just say briefly that this would be a good film for those who haven't yet seen a large number of films . But I have seen lots of films and I read this from the start.   This was a predictable film and rather slow but not an entirely bad film 
 I read the two other bad reviews here and just bought 9 of these anyway. I was stupid.  I had bought one in the past and have had it for a few months.  That one is great and has held up after multiple washings.  It is still so soft.  So I just didn't belive the two bad reviews.  I WAS WRONG.  The bad reviews are correct.  I took these new 9 out of the box yesterday.   They are not of the same quality of the one I already have.  They are packed at least 3 different ways.  I think maybe some of them are someone else's defective returns.    I don't think these are first quality.  There are MANY snags.  There is at least one blue stain.  One looks like it was defective and then repaired sloppily. The quality of the construction is not good.  Some are soft, some are rough.  I returned all 9.  DO NOT BUY 
 Why anyone would publish an unillustrated version of this marvelous book is beyond my understanding. Do not take my granting of a whole star as any sort of endorsement; one star is the lowest rating available 
 Stephen Barrett aka 'quackbuster' has an agenda against pretty much everything outside the established medical industry. His group has been backed by big drug companies, has launched malicious lawsuits (all of which they have lost by the way). His bias is so conspicuous and his opinions so lacking in fact and objectivity that nothing he writes is to be believed. To attack vitamins where the cost is low, substantial benefits have been proven in trials and toxicity is virtually non-existant is ludicrous. Especially when you consider that the conventional medical industry which Barrett and his gang represent is one of the leading causes of death in the USA (over 100,000 annual deaths caused by prescribed drugs alone), it is even more laughable 
 I bought this based on the enthusiasm of the reviews.  I can only surmise that the reviewers are either friends and family of this group, or that Incognito has compromising pictures of the reviewers.  If you're into wedding bands, then this is for you.  If you're looking for an original sound with a real groove, look elseswhere.  
 I ordered this product relying on the picture. I got the wrong one. Shipped it back but never got any credit back yet. Am still waitin 
 Heron's experiences are entertaining. She writes with humor and with  honesty.  However, her writing is somewhat choppy and even slow in places.   I felt disappointed at the end of this book, somehow let down by her lack  of 'depth' and insight into the suffering that she witnessed daily.  Her  clinical evaluations and uplifting sense of humor were a treat, but  spiritual and psychological observations were not easily found in this  work 
 I doubt this man believes in these beings himself,for he is just reciting folklore.I have met them myself.In John Keel's book "Why Ufo's" and Major Jack Downings writings,the describe some strange encounters with them.   This is St. George,out 
 OK, first off, I bought this full price($27+) at a local independent bookstore. So you can get it here instead and that price savings might be more worthwhile for what you get.  It's really sad but I just didn't find it funny enough. I bought it for a gift and after reading it, now will return it and spend my 30 bucks on something actually worth $30.   Don't get me wrong, parts of this are absolutely hilarious, but not enough parts to make it worth the price. I wish it were shorter, because such a big book should be jammed packed from start to finish with rib-splitting humor. Instead, I felt like I really had to look for the funny parts. The photos are amusing - all 60's & 70's retro stuff. The recipes are out of the same era - good housekeeping influenced etc.  I think it fails because it is too much in the middle of the road. There are actually recipes and hostess tips you can actually use in this book but you have to sort them out of everything else(all the humor/irony/retro stuff). Or if you're looking for the humor side of it, then yes, the humor is here too, but you have to sort through all the actual practical mundane tips & recipes as well.  Here's my tips: Look before you buy - and this might be a really good gift item for those under 30?  And here's my favorite tip from the book: "A good trick is to fill your medicine cabinet with marbles. Nothing announces a nosey guest better than an avalanche of marbles hitting a porcelain sink" 
 I picked up this book expecting a fresh approach and analysis of Dr. King apart from the obligatory images we're force-fed each new year.  Instead, I was disappointed to find that Eric Dyson made heavy use of speculation with the intent to scandalize more than to inform and enlighten.  One such example includes Dyson conveying the idea that Dr. King may have engaged in orgies with many different women along with his right-hand man Ralph Abernathy.  He then goes on to infer that there was talk of King and Abernathy engaging in sexual acts with each other!  The author had no commentary to either support or dispel this "theory" making Dyson's retelling of the alleged incident totally irresponsible and even libelous.  He just dropped the information, true or untrue, in the readers lap to do with as the reader pleased.  To that end, it is my opinion that Dyson's intent in writing this book was in no way honorable or truth-seeking, rather it was a means to convey his baseless ideas to anyone who would listen.  I'm reminded of something my grandmother and mother would always say to me, "an empty wagon makes the loudest noise." Eric Dyson makes a lot of noise in this book but totally lacks substance.  This was an expensive tabloid 
 Wish I would have paid attention to this one, the the previous review.  The cost for what you get is OUTRAGEOUS.  Only reason I gave it one star is because there was no place to give is ZERO starts.  Don't waste your money like I did!!!  FIND A MORE ECONOMICAL PRODUCT (plenty more choices on Amazon BTW) 
 The Next Attack is one of the latest - and worst - examples of popcorn political diatribes that lack substance, intellectual heft and reasoned analysis.  Unlike Through our Enemies' Eyes and Imperial Hubris, the Next Attack makes unsubstantiated histrionic pronouncements and offers the authors' opinions dressed up as meaningful observations.  Moreover, they offer little to give meaning to the subtitle of the book - there is virtually nothing of substance relating to "a strategy for getting it right."  If you're only going to read one book about what's right and wrong (and there is a great deal wrong with it) this, unfortunately, isn't it 
 Jeff Buckley sounds like what Marc Bolan would have sounded like if Bolan had taken Perry Como as his musical muse.  Seriously, think about Marc Bolan trying to sound like a '50's crooner and you'll know what Jeff Buckley sounds like 
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 If this book is one of your options for a history class and you have other options, choose again please!. it is for your sake i say this. this book has the hardest thesis to pic out of any history book i have read. i find myself wondering "john lewis gaddis" how in the world did he end up involved with a history book at oxford press. he cant seem to stay on his subject of "the cold war" i give this book 2 stars because its sentance structures are not as horible as many history books. john lewis gaddis has potencial as an author as long as he stays away from history books. if you are not intending to read this book for you education, but rather for the plesure, i advise you to look some where else.. 
 "As an African American gay man, Gomes is interested in re-viewing the biblical passages on sexuality and race" Without even picking up this book, you can see where it is going. The Bible clearly speaks out against the homosexual lifestyle? Strike those passages. The Bible is God's word and ought to read as such, not reinterpreted to make us feel better about our sin. By the way, being named one of the best seven preachers by TIME magazine is like being named one of the best seven Republicans by MoveOn.org, it doesn't hold much authority. Read a decent translation of the Bible for yourself and see what God has to say to you 
 Talentless people and garbage music  torture you in this turkey-in no time flat,you'll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming "MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" out into the yard.Do not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense 
 I usually would briefly summarize the plot in my reviews, but there really isn't one to write about.  It feels like a "days of our lives" soap opera of Betsy's life...she and eric are in love, she and eric have a fight, then she and eric make up, re-wash and rinse.  I wouldn't mind this as much except Betsy is getting more annoying with each book.  I keep waiting for her to grow up and be more queenly.  Her though process is like a 13 year old, and I just want to shake her and tell her to grow up.  I feel like the author is making Betsy more immature so that she can put Betsy in sillier situations (that anyone with a brain can figure out in 2 minutes) to get a cheap laugh from the readers.  This is one book in the series that you can skip without loosing anything.  To be honest, I truly think Betsy's demon sister is a better character to read about.  Maybe the author could do that after Betsy's story fizzles out...like the next book.      
 These shoes are cute but 1) They are made wide 2) the heel is a little bigger than 2" 3) They are uncomfortable to walk in. I think I could find a better pair at Wal-mart if I had to.  The company charged me tax on their shipping charges so they get a BIG TWO THUMBS DOWN for that 
 This cd is a disgrace to all music worldwide, infact, i think id much rather stay up for a week straight and listen to my dog bark. Why would anyone buy this you ask? To find the answer you must first understand the steps of making this "album".   1. Find all the most sold out, popular artists.   2. Go to a preschool full of children who just ate 5mg of Oxycontin and 2 cups of sugar, and select the loudest, most annoying ones.   3. Go to your rich uncles house and beg for 5 million dollars to bribe all of the sold out artists, and a low-sales record company. (plus another $10,000 to settle court costs, after a kid becomes deaf to this "album")   4. Make the record and hope for the best, which won't happen.   Now that everyone understands the steps of making this "album" i can explain why someone would buy this.    Stupid advertising: Whenever a new kidsbop album comes out, the commercials are shown VERY OFTEN. Which pretty much hypnotizes everyone into thinking that it is a "great deal" and they have to buy it. Not only that, but after hearing constant repitions of the songs on the radio, people think this is just a mix of certain songs, not terrible remakes of them.    i don't think i need to go on any longer, i think i have made my point.    
 My wife received this heart rate monitor from me for Christmas 2005. First my wife, them my father in law and then finally I have been unable to get the chest strap to begin transmitting to the wrist watch. We have read the documentation and looked at the Timex web page without success so far. It is now January 2nd and I still cannot get it working. I may change my review later if I find this is all due to operator error, but at this point three well educated people have been unable to figure it out. At the very least there is a problem with either ease of use or documentation.   In the Fitness Sensor User Guide there are pieces listed that are not in my box. However, the web page does not mention them. I suspect the guide is an older version. If not, perhaps there has been a shipping error. In any case, I am not happy.  
 If Tess is going to continue to write books like this, she should switch her publisher to Harlequin Romance, it will give the unsuspecting buyer a "heads up."  It is not possible to describe the many short falls of this rather long boring novel without giving the romantic subplots away, let just say that the ME does no pathology as she is way too busy whining about an unatainable romance and the detective does no detecting as she is totally wrapped up in her parent's pathetic lives.  There is a bit of a mystery bouncing around in the book, but it is hardly worth wading through all those pages.  Come on Tess, you can do better than this 
 This book was not helpful for finding the right career, in a complete career change. I lothed the career I was in. This was the first career book I bought because of the recomendation of several people including a couple of career counselers. I believe people recommend this book because of its popularity and not its content.  Finding the right career is not a quick and easy 1,2,3 process, it takes time and consideration. I believe this book makes it a bit more difficult than it has to be.  I found this book wordy and lengthy; and it seems to have lots of useless information. The excersizes, while interesting, leave alot to be desired and they are a bit time comsuming.  After getting fustrated with this book I bought a much more useful book called "I Don't Know What I Want, but I Know It's Not This" 
 I ordered this and got a version from Beverly Wilshire Filmworks, not the version in the Amazon product listing. This is a cotinuing problem if you order used Hong Kong films. You order the film used and dont get the advertised version and instead get a cheap (maybe even illegal) copy. It is a grainy pixalated version with blurry lines across the screen. Amazon really needs to crack down on this and make them specify or ensure that you only get the advertised version 
 My 8-year old picked this up yesterday, she was very excited.  In summary, after about 15 minutes, she was in tears over the thing.  Reason being is that she was frustrated with the overall navigation and controls for configuring and setting up the thing.  We located the instructions buried in the packaging, and were able to eventually get past it.    After configuring, she had the instructions out trying to send messages - she finally was able to do it, but it's not very easy.  In addition, the IR is a severe limitation as line of sight must be maintained.    This product would be much better if it was RF-based, and was less cryptic in the initial setup, as well as sending a message.  For example to send a message, here's process:  - Chat Mode button - type message - send button - it then asks for the P/I? which we have no clue what that is - then hit ICQ button   Several steps, lots of button pushing, not the most intuitive.  Recommend that you do not buy this 
 If it were possible to give this book 0 stars, that is what it would get. Where in the world does the author pick up her info? It is clear that she has very little to say about feng shui that is remotely authentic. Too bad for the Americans who don't know our Chinese tradition that they fall for such nonsense like this book. Maybe the author will someday learn feng shui, since  she poses as an authority. Her book reminds one of the old Chinese slang term for a con-artist, i.e., fengshui professor. Just pity the trees whose wood goes to make the paper on which this nonsense is printed 
 This sounds great in theory, being that you don't have to get under the car to drain the oil. Fantastic! But while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars, I don't quite agree. You still have to get under the car to change the oil filter, so I'd suggest saving $50 and taking the ten seconds to drain the oil from under the car, which is actually faster than using this device. 
 I have recently completed reading BabyWise II. I consider myself a Christian and this book is extremely popular in my church. Throughout the entire book, I had moments of complete confusion and disagreement accompanied by moments of complete agreement and lucidity regarding how to implement these methods. However, by the end, I realized that I should not be confused by or passionately against any section of a book that would truly benefit my child.   While I believe there are some helpful and necessary methods in the book, I had already found much of that advice in other sources. For example, feeding schedules are advocated by many resources, but those other sources are very clear when it comes to making sure babies' basic needs are met before implementing such routines. With my knowledge from other resources, I attempted to read BabyWise with a bit of grace, but at the same time I felt guilt and coercement at many points; for instance, when I realized that my child was having one more meal a day than what is 'recommended' by Mr. Ezzo for a child her age. For the record, my pediatrician generally recommends one more meal than she is receiving for a child her age.   This concern and my confusion on other subjects in the book prompted me to speak to my husband about the book and I asked him to read it. He read only the forward and immediately became suspicious. He asked me if there were any references and I instantly realized there were none. It then became clear that the pediatrician listed as an author indeed had no authorship save the foreword, and that Mr. Ezzo has had no formal education regarding child development. A very quick search on the internet confirmed our deductions, and we found many articles against Mr. Ezzo's methods, including a well documented student's masters thesis. Out of curiosity and still trying to find a way to defend this popular book, I performed internet searches on all of the other resources on child development we own (four books; all of which document research for their claims and advice) and found absolutely no negative press for any.   Based on how unclear I found the teachings in the book and how much bad advice I had to sort out, I strongly urge anybody who reads this book to read other books first. As I said, I don't disagree with all of the methods and advice, but it should be seen as advice from a person who has raised obedient (not a bad thing) children and has no other qualifications beyond that. You could do just as well asking advice from a friend or acquaintence with children who possess qualities you admire. As we all know every child is different and reacts to different discipline methods differently. Please make sure you go to many resources to find the option best suited to your child.   Just an end note: As popular as this book is among my friends, I have not known anybody to follow the BabyWise book beyond feeding schedules and sleeping issues,  and there is a good reason for that: Not all of it is good advice 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 Paul Gilster's, "Digital Literacy", is not a book about how to get around the Internet, but rather about enhancing the human experience.  The World now rests upon a point and click procedure.  He talks about how  landmark inventions, such as written language and the printing press,  changed how procedures were done.  He feels that the Internet ranks up with  these monumental inventions.  This is not a passing fad.  Gilster calms  fears about the possibility of the virtual library pushing the real library  to extinction.  They are parallels.  The virtual book is used for specific  information.  "The physical book is what I bring to the easy chair in  front of my fireplace to read, to explore, to mull over with a glass of  wine."  Gilster also talks about the importance of using discretion  when finding information.  Many sites out there are not credible, but many  are.  Make sure the source is credible.  This book is written for  individuals who already have computer knowledge.  It doesn't show you how  to get around the Internet, but rather, increases methodology on how to  find specific information, after exploiting popular resources, and a  reorientation of the thinking process.  I found this book to be boring, and  above my level of computer knowledge.  I would recommend this book to  individuals who spend an above average amount of time on the Internet, and  are looking for ways to increase their computer knowledge 
 As an undergrad in college I was required to read this novel for an English course--go figure.  From what I remember the story is centered around a woman who is caught up in a theocratic regime which takes over the US, and she is forced to abhorrent things like have men in the administration sire children through her.  Looking back now, the situation described in the novel reminds me more of the Stalin regime than any type of theocracy I can think of, even the kind they have in some muslim countries (Yevgeny Zamyatins "We" comes more to mind--Stalin admired that novel).  In fact, the "abhorrent" situation I described above is not much unlike the "Lebensborn" program (a.k.a. "human stud farm") which Heinrich Himmler used to propagate the "Aryan" race during the Third Reich.  And you youngsters who have been brainwashed into believing that Hitler's government was Christian, you ought to read up on the occult roots of Nazism (see e.g. Peter Levenda's book) 
 I find it necessary to include the fact that I read this book for class and not from personal interest.  Though I agree with previous comments that the book was well written regarding style and grammar, I found reading this book to be a laborious task.  The author subjects himself to an experience with drugs, vomits, does not wake up for several days, and then continues to subject himself to this...repeatedly.  If anybody wishes to know what it is like to experience various narcotic trips after a white rabbit and is not inclined to read Alice in Wonderland, this is for you.  The book is basically a series of accounts of one man's experiences with wacky weed and magic mushrooms 
 I anticipated more of this book just from the reviews, but I guess I was wrong. I gave it a chance and kept reading thinking it would get better as it progresses but it didn't. i stopped halfway through when I realized that I'm only torturing my self, I could've read about quantum physics and it would've been more entertaining. I did not see the humor or the point of this book 
 For me, Krazy Kat by Jay Cantor was the third in a sort-of trilogy of novels that retold the stories of various comic book type characters.  Zorro (maybe not a comic book hero, but definitely close in fashion) by Isabel Allende and It's Superman by Tom DeHaven were retellings that were faithful to the original characters and stories and both were delights to read.  Krazy Kat is not, but it's not the fact that it is revisionist that makes this book fail; instead it's the fact that it's a mess.  For those unfamiliar with Krazy Kat the comic strip, this book should definitely be avoided, as it would be like trying to watch a single episode of a serial and understanding instantly what's going on:  it just won't happen.  You need the history to get the present picture.  But for those who dare go in without this familiarity, I offer this brief description:  Krazy Kat was a comic strip that ran in the first half of the 20th century.  Krazy was the main character, who loved Ignatz the Mouse.  Ignatz did not return the feelings, instead choosing to constantly bean Krazy Kat in the head with a brick.  But Krazy only thought of this as a sign of affection.  The third character was Offisa Pup, who loved Krazy and would run Ignatz off to jail.    It was a simple concept, but brilliantly executed, so through the decades, the strip remained fresh and is considered by some to be the best comic strip ever.  In particular, it was a favorite of various big name celebrities such as Walt Disney and Charlie Chaplin.  Even now, among its fans, Krazy Kat is considered more than a comic strip.  It is considered art.  Cantor's novel focuses on the premise that Krazy and Ignatz viewed the atomic bomb test in 1945 New Mexico.  For Krazy, this forced her (Krazy's gender tended to fluctuate in the strip) to accept reality in a way she never had before.  Suddenly, the bricks began to hurt.  Krazy retires from the strip and becomes something of a recluse.  Ignatz, who wants to get back to work, tries to cure her.  The novel is told in five sections:  the first section tells of the onset of Krazy's problems.  The second section deals with Ignatz's psychoanalysis.  The third has them getting involved with motion pictures; the fourth with them joining a revolutionary group and the final one deals with their "romance" in an off-beat manner.  I imagine that this novel would have a very limited appeal.  First of all, it would only be read by those familiar with Krazy Kat, but many of those people would be fans and would view this as a desecration of their favorite characters, especially in the last, mildly pornographic portion of the book.  So it would only possibly appeal to those who can take the abuse these characters will get.  Fan as I am of the strip, I'd still be willing to read something revisionist if it was done well, but here it isn't.  This book, as stated before, is a mess.  Cantor, in his attempt to be literary, often fails in his attempt to be readable.  This book was a bit of a chore to read, with barely enough quality to merit two stars.  The humor is either overly subtle or like that brick to the head.  This may be one of those books that gets better the more times it's read, but I don't know if it's worth the effort.  My recommendation is to skip this book and buy a collection of the original strips instead (many of which will cost almost the same). 
 This book misrepresents eating disorders and makes eating disorder sufferers almost seem psychotic. The author is very inexperienced with eating disorders and only has her word to back up her statements. She puts down eating disorder facts that have proven to be true for many of us that have suffered with eating disorders. The one good thing about the book is how she encourages treating victims of eating disorders with love and compassion and her methods  may work with some individuals, yet I have talked to those that have said that working with her was a terrible experience. I think her kindness is what drew her clients. She states that her way is the only way to help anorexics which ignores the fact that people are individuals. And she ignores the fact that other therapists besides her have had a high success rate and she puts down therapies that have helped me and many others. Some of her theories almost seem  mystical. Almost like those with eating disorders are saints or psychics of some sort.  It is good to note that her clinic was closed down for operating without a license.   
 I am very disappointed in the book  The book is written poorly, very dry and expensive for what you get.  It really isn't a good reference guide there is no glossary or chapter listing.   The best information I have on Anatomy is the DVD by Paul Grilley Anatomy for Yoga.  
 Note that Sansa provides no support for this player on Vista, even though (as I write this in March) Vista has been available to customers for 5 months.  You will not be able to update the device's firmware (which is several versions behind as shipped), and Sansa provides no guidance as to when they might (if ever) they will support Vista.  (And they wonder can't compete with the iPod?) 
 I was appalled to learn that these films are squeezed together, two on each side of each disc.  As a longtime fan of Hammer horror I greatly enjoyed being able to collect the studio's Dracula & Frankenstein films individually on DVD.  I'm a completist and I would like to also own Hammer's 'Brides Of Dracula' and 'Evil Of Frankenstein' individually as well so that they may complement the other films in their respective series on my video shelf.  Squeezing them in a box set with other non-related films from the Hammer library is a great disrespect to these classics, making all of these films look cheap in the process.  Why release 6 out of the 7 Frankensteins and 8 out of the 9 Draculas individually but not 'Brides Of Dracula' and 'Evil Of Frankenstein'?  This makes no sense! 
 One of the more boring and ill-thought out books I have read this decade.  Deford is somewhat of a moron, yet thinks he is the gift to planet earth.  I would not recommend reading this at all.  I can't believe I gobbled it up at a used book store 
 I can't figure out what is so special about this rice cooker so I am irritated by the price which is making me wonder if their whole product line is over priced  
 Grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  It would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not.   For great Grisham read The Firm and The Partner.  For very good, read Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  All of these are page turners.  Street Lawyer is a stomache turner.  Really bad.  What happened 
 I have read all buy 1, and felt this was the weakest.  It was still good, but lacked in a lot of ways.... 
 For someone who is reading the whole series at one time, this book might be great. But when I read this book, it had been over two years since I'd read the one before it, and I could not even finish it. I tried to stick with it, but I eventually put it down and could not pick it up again. Is this not the conclusion to the MITFORD series? So why can't a poor reader read about MITFORD instead about a bunch of characters we know nothing about, who we won't get to know very well seeing as this is the last book. I am a big fan of the whole series, but this book was simply painful. 
 There is no shortage of Islam apologists who use perfumed pleasantries to cover the ugly truth of the world's most intolerant religion, but they aren't as intelligent, affable and widely read as Aslan.  On pages 64-65 he makes the wild and totally unsubstantiated claim that Muhammad was only betrothed to his child bride, Aisha, when she was nine, but consummated with her after she hit puberty.  Unfortunately for Aslan, every Muslim source says clearly that they were married when she was six and consummated when she was nine.  Either Aslan has not read Sahih Bukhari or Sahih Muslim, or he's baldly lying.  Since he doesn't cite his sources, we must assume the latter.  Likewise he soft peddles life in the dhimma on pages 94-95.  He gives the definition of dhimmi as "protected" but conveniently leaves out that it simultaneously means "guilty," then goes on to suggest that dhimmitude is not an example of Islamic subjugation of other faiths, but is in fact an example of Islam's high degree of tolerance!  He excuses out of hand the wholesale slaughter and mass beheading of the Jewish Banu Qurayza tribe by saying it was not at all unusual for the time and offers as proof the fact that no other local Jewish tribes complained about it.  This is a terrible book, with no citations for wild and fictional claims.  But look at the reviews from the NY Times, LA Times, London Independent, and so on: "wise, passionate, insightful" -- with vetting like that, readers would be forgiven for not knowing they are being lied to.  Beware 
 Just bought Mapsend from Amazon. They sent me version 2 when this is clearly out of date. Don't be fooled - it's a piece of crap. This is devious and dishonest of Amazon - no wonder it was marked down. Avoid Magellan at all costs.....avoid Mapsend at all costs.....maybe even avoid Amazon if this is typical of the stunts they pull. 
 Found the item to be poorly designed. Did not fit my checks or recorder. Item is useless unless you use checks with side tear 
 This is the worst wrestling bio book ever and for one very good reason: there is no wrestling in it! Oh yes, sorry, about 50 pages out of 300 are about wrestling... The rest of the book is meaningless... I am sorry I ever bought it.. 
 I was severely dissapointed. The commercial and radio spot played a song that was beautiful but of course it wasn't on the soundtrack. I HATE it when they do that. It was boring and uninspired. This dude needs to take some advice from James Newton Howard, Hans Zimmer, or Danny Elfman 
 This book has a fairly annoying layout which refers back to information not previously mentioned.  The examples are also fairly overly complex, there are much simpler ways to solving the problems.  Regardless, it was a required book 
 I don't know what album these other reviewers are listening to. I am a big fan of orchestral movie soundtracks, ones with fantasy themes in particular. This doesn't come close to Poledouris or Shore. This is nothing but above-average new-age music masquerading as a soundtrack. If the Conan soundtrack is the defining album of the genre (and it is) and rates as a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, then the Lord of The Rings movie soundtrack would rate an 8, and this little Arkenstone minor-league Middle Earth thing would rate a 3. Go get the real thing and don't waste your time here 
 This was a very disappointing Christmas gift for my daughter. We were able to return it, so we're happy with Amazon - but it's a bummer of a toy. The problem is that the controllers work so poorly - when you try to use them, you have to keep pressing the buttons over and over and over again to get the signal to register on the DVD player. A very frustrating experience. Not sure if something was wrong with our particular controllers, or if they all work that way. Another bad feature is that if your child wants to take the game to a friend's house - they have to spend 10 - 15 minutes reprogramming the controllers all over again to work on the friend's particular DVD player 
 I find it hard to believe that this my hometown that Kaufmann is writing about. Notice he doesn't even live there.  He lives in a town nearby.  It's a wonder he wasn't run out of town (maybe he was and that's why he doesn't live in Batavia).  I'm sorry but this is not an affetionate tale.  Kaufmann obviously has no love for the town.  Yes, Batavia has problems but any town or city does and we love them anyway.  It's home.  Go back to Washington, Mr. Kaufmann 
 I have to say I agree with the prev. poster; this is just awful. Can you say "Norman Bates," people? Mom crawling on the floor to get into the kid's room? Weird.   The idea of the decrepit old mom being rocked to sleep by the grown man was so profoundly creepy I don't know where to begin. I'm surprised the next page wasn't Mom in a casket. *shudder*  Yes; these are some wonderful themes of acceptance, stages of life, etc FOR ADULTS. 
 There is very little of substance to this book with regard to concrete suggestions on strategies a person can use to work with ADD as an adult - especially in the work place; lots of "stories."  There is great emphasis about enlisting the help of family, friends, coworkers.  People with ADD just want to work with it; they don't want their world to be involved in it. A very disappointing missive 
 "The Man Who Sold the World" is an album that established a reputation-- David Bowie, pop songster and pyschedelic folkster, did a dramatic about-face and reinvented himself as a dark metal rocker.  In 2006, this sort of reinvention of Bowie is something that was expected, but in 1970, this must have been rather unexpected.  Influencing this change was no doubt the presecne of guitar hero Mick Ronson, whose embracing of distortion and feedback made this entirely possible.  The results of this change, quite honestly, are a lot more mixed then most Bowie fans would lead you to believe-- "The Man Who Sold the World" has been elevated to cult status and truthfully it's not that the album is bad per se, it's just that it's not particularly exciting.  Bowie lets us know right away that things have changed-- "Width of a Circle" is an extended cut drenched in feedback and distorted guitars with a galloping bassline (played by producer Tony Visconti) and a rambling vocal from Bowie.  No doubt it woke a lot of people up as to the change of direction, and it proves to be a decent number.  But Bowie seems incapable of really sustaining this and seems unsure how to integrate it into his idiom-- "All the Madmen" starts as a bleak acoustic ballad before overdriven guitars and a downright irritating synth line get in the way, "After All" ends up being a dull Lou Reedish ballad, and many of the metalish pieces are pretty much unmemorable ("She Shook Me Cold", the lyrically fantastic "Running Gun Blues").  The album closes on a high note, with the bizarre folk/metal fusion title track (made famous decades later by Nirvana's performance of it on MTV) and the fractured, paranoid, and downright bizarre metal churn of "The Superman", but the album is a bit too inconsistent to be a completely satisfying listen.  There's enough on here to make it worth a pickup for those exploring Bowie's catalog, but he'd do siginificantly better work in the very near future.  This one is more a curiosity 
 This book while well written contains too much stuff that Windows2000  Professional shares with WindowsNT.  It is not a good reference book.   Perhaps it would be better off positioned as an introductory text because  it has too much fluff 
 First of all, everyone is entitled to their opinion.  While I respect everyones take on this album, I am amazed by how varied our tastes are and by how much we vary on this album.  Frankly, I didn't care for this album at all.  The songs do not match the singers - with few exceptions.  Angie Stone sounded great and Fantasia was good.  I will say that my favorite song and rendition on this album was Celine Dion's.  Yes, I am a fan of hers but I can be impartial.  Her voice and style blended perfectly with the emotion of the song.  Maybe because she lost her father and can show the emotional range required to be able to sing it.  No one can sing it like Luther but Celine came close.  Luther had a rare talent and the music industry will suffer for this loss.  Overall, you can skip the album and just preview the songs and buy your favorites individually. 
 Given the price, the quality and performance of this multi-function printer is very good.  Scanning speed, especially that for black-and-white document, is among the best.  Document feeder works quite reliably, rarely jams up.    The following are the issues we had with this machine, most of them with regard to software:  (1) the native PDF converter is outright bad.  For the same resolution, it results in a file size at least five times as much as Adobe Acrobat.  For routine electronic document handling, we are used to Adobe Acrobat's file size of about 30k-50k per page at 200 dpi.  Because these documents need to be stored in large quantity and e-mailed routinely, even a 50% increase of the size would be burdensome, not to even mention five times.  Apparently, software engineers of Brother did a terrible job on this. Fortunately, we figured out a fairly reasonable workflow by using Adobe Acrobat with the printer in tandem to solve this oversize problem. If you don't have the rather expensive Adobe Acrobat, you might be out of luck.  (2) the interface is decidedly crude. And no update has been released since its original release.  It just lacks some of the refined details, which in an office setting significantly affect efficiency and workflow.  For example, every time when a scan is started, it defaults to the choice of "color scanning" at A4 size.  It does not remember your last setting.  We do most of our scanning with "black-and-white" at letter size.  That means we will have to change the selection every time when we do scan. How difficult is it to have a feature to just remember the last setting?  Again, software engineers at Brother did a very poor job.  This seems trivial, but if you are using the printer on a regular basis in an office setting, it significantly affects efficience and productivity.  It is such a big issue that we would absolutely be willing to pay twice as much for a multi-function laser printer just to get a better workflow.  (3) the bypass feeder has poor paper alignment. The printed material is in most cases seriously misaligned on the paper, making the bypass feeder basically useless for printing checks or formal documents such as letterheads. That means for that type of work you will always need to use the main paper tray.  This is quite inconvenient because normally you would stock the main paper tray with regular paper and use the bypass feeder to print envelopes, checks, and letterheads.  Because the printer has only one paper tray, the poor bypass feeder has a significant negative impact on the workflow.  We would not buy it again.  However, if you don't find the above issues a problem, this printer is a great workhorse 
 It's very good, and I only give it one star because my teacher ruined it for me.  She analyzed everything Arthur Miller wrote in it, whether the lights were to be dark, or bright, how he shift time, how the instruments played, believing symbols of all of them.  Contrary to Arthur Millers own statements which I printed out and gave to the class, that he didn't plan on anything, he just wrote.  Let people do with it what they do.  In that affect, the teacher took a great play, and ruined it with her ideas of what he meant.  
 Free radicals are bad for you because they are molecules that destroy your cellas and promote ageing and sickness. Wow.   Unfortunately it would seem the evil stuff is everywhere so there is no real escaping our sad certainity of ageing and decay.  Mostly it goes like that. One actually useful bit of info: avoid salami, sausages and the like.  We get more substance once one reaches the inevitable My Recipies part. Let's see. OK, you are supposed to eat a little salad for lunch, a small piece of chicken for lunch with some veggies, and so on.  Yeah right. You probably will lose some weight.  Yawn 
 Actually, I'm going to keep it really real. I know most of you reviewers  who gave this album 4-5 stars reviews are too blinded by 1980's nostalgia to see and hear that this music is utter crap. Vanity 6 was hot back in the day, but it was due to their s1utty image and not their music. Why do you think the only song you hear by them on the radio is "Nasty Girls"?  That's the only song people remember them for.  Let me tell you a secret: This CD isn't worth $29.52. In fact it shouldn't be worth anything because the music is boring- nothing 'hilarious' or 'interesting' about it. Plenty of of melodies being sung in warbly vocals over Casio go-go beats w/ no bass. I was able to download all of the tracks and after I listened to them, I thanked my lucky stars that I didn't spend one dime on it. Vanity was beautiful, but she couldn't sing or dance. Susan tried to portray herself as cute and innocent, but she couldn't really pull it off with that moustache. Brenda was just whatever. I feel sorry for anyone who buys "Vanity 6" 
 This book tells you what you already knew - clean, declutter, fix broken stuff, and clean up the yard.  That's about it.  The reason the book is more than ten pages long is that it is chock full of the author's stories about how wonderful she is and what a staging pioneer she is.  I really wish I hadn't wasted my money on this fluffy piece of advertising 
 Yeah, the music is good (excepting the crappy "Godfather" remake), but this is a little over 60 minutes of music released on two CDs, for no good reason other than to charge the unwitting consumer more money. You could fit the entire collection on one disc, and have room for 8 more songs (they're saving those for "Mob Hits 2", ripping you off at store near you!). There are better compilations out there... and better deals 
 I purchased the book in order to find a market regarding the holistic health benefits network for which I sell.  This book enlightens those who are "working for the man" and the reason for sky rocking health cost.  It brings to light the fact that younger people who rarely see the doctor are paying through the nose for older people in their workplace who enjoy unhealthy lifestyles and are addicted to lifestyle drugs. With the current system, as the boomer generation continues to become the largest workforce, the younger generation will burden the cost of workforce health insurance premiums.   The book gives the solution to this situation as purchasing a private policy.  It also indicates how affordable these private policies can be.  However, the author misleads the reader in regards to premium rates and premium increases.  On page 10 and other pages he writes "premiums on most individual/family policies cannot be increased." Guess what, depending upon the health, claims, and cost within that group, the insurance company can and do indeed increase premiums. The author contradicts his own statement on page 20 by saying "Monthly premiums paid for individual policies typically increase annually with the level of inflation or overall medical costs."  The author also indicates in several areas of the book that "good health insurance" for an individual or a family is now only $150.00 to $300.00 per month.  The term "good health insurance" is what to this author?  On page 26, he contends he pays $400.00 a month for a "superdeluxe" family policy for a family of six and he is 51 years of age. He fails to mention his "superdeluxe high deductible."  I also only pay $351.00 a month for a family of four, but my deductible is $2500.00.   The book explains eye-opening standards of what insurance companies are doing such as uprating.  Even the author experienced this situation because of what a doctor wrote about a minor back problem.  However, this author, an experienced insurance salesman (selling mostly for Blue Cross Blue Shield) indicates how he was able to "counteroffer" the increase from his earlier $400.00 a month to $520.00 down to $460.00 a month.  I wonder how many people (not being a broker for Blue Cross Blue Shield could work that out?)    Many parts of the book are an advertisement for Blue Cross Blue Shield, especially since the author offers no solution to those who are uninsurable other than obtaining insurance through a high risk pool of costs upward of $4800.00 a year, only if your state has such an animal. It is interesting that a book titled "The New Health Insurance Solution" would omit a chapter on discount health benefit programs.  If the author used such a discount program with his chiropractor, then his minor back injury would not have been reported to the big "medical computer in the sky" and he wouldn't have been uprated by Blue Cross Blue Shield.  Chapter 10 talks about "How to Be a Smart Healthcare Shopper," but nowhere in the book does he discuss the options available regarding health benefit discount programs (other than a discount prescription card).  "Smart Healthcare Shoppers" are joining the members of companies like Ameriplan, where they receive discounts on the actual costs of their medical care.  Like the discounts similar to those with insurance plans that charge high cost premiums supporting the sick and older people in their insurance pool.  Discount health programs also do not report to the big "medical computer in the sky."  Your health is your business, and you won't be uprated or turned down.  This is the solution for the uninsurable, young families, college students, and healthy people.  In general, this book is hard to read and understand if you do not have a background in the insurance, employee benefits, or medical administration.  The book is technical, misleading, and not for the layman!  However if you do sell a discount health benefits program like Ameriplan, invest in this book as it lays out your target market!

 The importance of Derrida and his movement is monumental - not for the term "deconstructionism" (heard frequently without a clue to its true meaning) but for how he has influenced (Western) society. Derrida, like Marcuse, Chomsky, Foucault and others, has moved from his original study to a broader agenda and, like many intellectuals, considers his mastery of one subject transferrable to another.  He managed to survive the embarrassing Paul de Man fiasco and has since wisely avoided mention of the "Hitler in all of us".  He has remarked on the authoritarian anti-democratic nature of deconstructionism, treating the subject ironically.   This is, allegedly, a textbook of post-Modern thought on language but reads like a didactic, out-of-focus Proust. The writing is  nebulous, self-referential, unreadable. He speaks in Orwellian terms equating opposite qualities and words. It is so ephemeral as to lack certitude and for this very reason many commentators fear definitive statements on the subject. Deconstructionism is, despite all the twaddle, inherently subjective. He muses on expression, anxiety, emotions, signs and existentialism, finding meaning and interpretation where there is none. His popularity rests entirely on academia and like-minded camp followers in the media. I mean, how many Iowans care about the "ultimate" meaning of allusions? The problem with the ouevre is that  when taken seriously, it literally make mountains of molehills.  Such as, well, equating fairy tales to S&M sagas, symphonies to invitations to rape, skyscrapers to phallic power trips, signs of "white" recycled paper as racism and stuttering as aggression. Allusions are, in Derrida-speak, fraught with deep meaning. To accomplish this one must divorce words from their sources and stated intent. The critic has been necessarily elevated above the  author since only he can provide a "true"  meaning. It is so outrageous that few outside of the Ivory Towers give it credence. That would be a mistake. Language is perhaps the most human of all abilities and its interpretation affects our personal and collective consciousness. His method has been called the "language of cultural Marxism" and is a necessary component of modern leftist ideology.  At any time I expect Jacques Derrida to announce, like Alan Sokal, that it has all been a collosal joke on both the true believer and the reader 
 I felt obligated to finish the trilogy.  It was a mistake.  This book was so unbelievably boring.  You see, Tristan and Isolde get separated.  Then Tristan is beset by something and then Isolde whines to the Goddess, oh my love my love.  Then they get back together, and then they get separated and then Tristan is beset by something and Isolde whines to the Goddess, oh my love my love.  Repeat. It's horrid.  I wish I could get a refund.  Truly, don't waste your time.  Try the Kushiel series by Jacqueline Carey, it's a way better investment in your time (and reading dollar.) 
 I confess to being a big fan of the Coen brothers, which is why I was surprised at my response to this film. With a cast to die for, it has all the makings of a terrific film. Unfortunately, that is about as far as it gets, as the cast cannot undo what has been done by a screenplay that is seriously flawed, due to its inability to decide what type of film it should be. Unfortunately, it looks as if the director could not make up his mind either, producing a film that is neither fish nor fowl.   At first, I thought that it would be a screwball type of comedy, with George Clooney in the role that would have gone to Cary Grant in the golden age of filmmaking. Then, it seems to take another direction altogether, as if it were supposed to be a romantic comedy with a dark side or simply satire gone awry. Who knows? The Coen brothers surely don't. The film lacks a total surety of identity that kills it, despite the stellar cast. It is a flop, pure and simple.   The plot line is a fairly basic one. It is about a slick, greedy and grasping, unscrupulous matrimonial attorney (George Clooney), the kind that gives all lawyers a bad name, and a greedy and grasping gold digging beauty (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who gives all beautiful women a bad name. Their paths cross, and the chase is on. Unfortunately, the viewer does not give a rat's behind about either one of them. There is nothing that would ingratiate them to the viewer, due to the two dimensional, leaden screenplay to nowhere in which laughs are few and far between.  If you are a die hard Coen brothers fan, as I am, do yourself a favor and, rather than buy this film, rent it first. You will thank me for this advice, once you have seen this film 
 I have been into the hobby of robotics for many years now and have to say that "THIS BOOK IS USELESS TO ANYONE HOPING TO BEGIN OR IMPROVE THEIR ROBOTICS SKILL SET". I was given this book as a gift for my birthday and have to admit it was a wasted gift. The first half (3rd actually) of the book is based on pure beginner how to and info, fine. Through out the basic discussion of gear ratios , batteries and electronics are references to the Arobot kit and how it is mentioned later. In the second half (3rd actually) of the book, where Roger starts the high level discussion on robotics,  all you do is construct the $235 - $318 robot kit that he sells on his web page. The most helpful information in the whole book came from the list of 10's section (the last 3rd) found in all dummies books. If it weren't a gift I would have gotten my money back 
 Thirteen year olds can be easily impressed by cheap tricks, "heartfelt" lyrics, and a lot of pretty lights. So it goes with some reviewers of this movie. This movie contains the unending internal reflections of about 6 or 7 different characters. These reflections never really go anywhere, never draw substantive conclusions. Primarily, there is just a lot of whining. THe only exception is the Sean Penn character until the end, when he whines at least as much as everybody else. "War is tough" is one of the main themes of this movie. Is that really a revelation?   One thing you learn early on in acting or directing classes is to "play opposites," meaning put contrasting things in juxtaposition so that the contrast highlights both sides. An example is when a very evil character such as Richard III uses humor. "I'll have her - but not for long." THe fact that the guy is joking about killing his new bride makes him all the more evil to us. At the same time, perhaps we can't avoid laughing in spite of ourselves.  OK, so this director had some of the same classes I did, but he has to use the technique over and over and over and over and over and ... until it starts seeming boring and banal. War scene, lots of dying. Oh look, a pretty butterfly! More blood and bullets. Oh gee, the light going through that leaf is beautiful! Use this trick once or twice and maybe it seems new to the uninitiated audience. Use it more than three times and you are asking for trouble. This director must use it 10-15 times. He turns it into a cliche. When the audience can predict when they are about to see the next opposite, you have overdone it.  So what do we have so far? A bunch of whining character crying about war being bad and a bunch of contrast scenes. And really, that's pretty much it. The movie could have been cut in half with no loss because if there is one thing this movie is, It Is Redundant. It is spoon-feeding you the same message over and over and over again. Ouch, war hurts! Ew, mutilated bodies are yucky. Oh gosh, a little bird got hurt!!! We are so nasty! We must stop this war!!! (never mind the fact that thousands of little birds get eaten alive by cats every day)  The director focuses on the yucky and inconvenient aspects of war - which I suppose would be briliant, except I think almost everybody on the planet already knows that wars are yucky and inconvenient. It's almost as if the author doesn't Believe we know, that he somehow thinks we missed it. And if only he reminds us at every possible repetitive opportunity, again and again and again, well, then maybe we will "get it" and start opposing wars, I guess. Never mind about Hitler and the 6 million jews. Never mind about Pearl Harbor. War is a yucky thing done by bad men, or nice whimpy men trapped in a situation by bad men. It has no meaning and there is nothing remotely noble about it. We were just wasting our time fighting the Nazis. The Nazis were just misunderstood! If they want to cook 6 million jews in the ovens, let them do it.  An adult movie deals with realties and poses questions like, "how do I get myself to do something that I don't want to do, but that I know I should?" Making yourself do things that are not pleasant is one of the hallmarks of reaching adulthood. This movie takes a very adolescent perspective and asks, "if I whine enough, can I get out of my chores?"   The dumbest scene in this movie is when the Jim Caveziel character is surrounded by Japanese and for no reason whatsoever, will not surrender. He stands there in the middle of about 40 Japanese soldiers and decides (after looking at some pretty leaves and butterlies) to raise his weapon so they will shoot him. The funny thing is, it's completely unnecessary: his comrades have already been warned. His death accomplishes nothing but relief for the audience - he can no longer utter his inane internal monologues.   I think if you are a left-winger or have a thing for looking at the bodies of naked boys, you will love this movie. It's the kind of propaganda piece that a vacant, unquestioning mind will eat up. If your leanings are more adult, however, you may hate it. You'll wonder why the story is so one-sided, why nobody seems to believe in the causes they are fighting for, even though the Japanese did attack us, and the Germans did some naughty things too. None of that seems to matter to the storyteller. "Why can't we all get along?" he cries, as the germans load another group of jews into the ovens and turn up the heat...  A final note: if you want to see two really good war movies that make valid criticisms of the "war spirit" and how wars are conducted, see "Gallipoli" and/or "Breaker Morant." These movies are extremely effective in making their points without using cartoonish characters. The characters are real and the plots move the story foreward.  "The Thin Red Line" is what I would call "professed brilliance." A couple of simple tricks are used to try to impress the audience. But there is no real meat here. It's just a bunch of pointless whining. The poetry is poorly written and pretentious. And the characters are not real.   
 The Blu-ray Disc is supposed to have 5 times more memory than standard DVD. So why can't they release ALL the special features (and more if possible) that the standard DVD has? I don't know if it's a product, copyright, or money issue, but this hasn't yet happened on HD DVD. The standard DVD of this movie has full-length audio commentary, 15 minutes of extended fight sequences with optional commentary, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a storyboard-to-film comparison, and a sneak peek at the Making Of the second "Transporter." None of that is on this Blu-ray. So if you're a real movie buff and like special features, get the Standard DVD of this movie 
   Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.   The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.   You can do better 
 This has been a hither and thither series.  Based on the interesting premise that, rather than go into a near terminal depression after Tara's death, Willow decides to turn to the dark side to resurrect her dead lover.  That this is impossible is besides the point, Willow is determined, and will stop at nothing - Neither Buffy, nor Giles, nor all the hauntings of Tara can stay her from the course.  This is a new, daring and, to be honest, extremely understandable Willow.  One whom, until this volume, was still a sympathetic character.  But now Giles has managed to imprison Tara.  When she finds this out Willow sets about a uniquely horrible revenge as one by one she feeds her ex-friends to a Gnarl, who likes to eat his meals slowly while alive.  In the process of this Navarro achieves what no Buffy writer has every accomplished before - a genuine horror story.  Unfortunately, in the process, the author throws away an opportunity to say something unique in the Buffy framework  Instead we wind up with a grim story in which no character shines, one that proceeds inexorably to an embarrassingly trite ending.  On Navarro's website she pointedly fixed the blame for the faults of this book on her publishers.  Admittedly, the Buffy annals are more tightly controlled than almost any other series, but regardless of whose fault it is, Broken Sunrise is a poor way to end the Wicked Willow series.  The writing is stilted, and the characters...  Well, Anya makes a poor showing, Buffy is permanently perplexed, and Giles makes one terrible mistake after another.  Tara, by the way, makes a very substandard ghost.  The strange thing is that Yvonne Navarro is one of the better writers to grace the Buffyverse.  To have her suddenly turn out a series that is underwritten for an adult series and a bit to grim for the yound adult crowd is more than disappointing.  If it was 20th Century Fox who set the rules, Navarro would have been better off to decline the offer.  Or to write what she is really capable of and devil take the hindmost 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 This is the worst movie I ever seen there was no subject no story Iam very sorry for buying this film  
 This text is one of the most poorly written I have read on the subject of data structures.  The JAVA overview should be removed since it goes into no real details pertinent to data structures, and uses a grammar to define the language which serves to confuse more than assist in learning.  I suppose they felt they needed to be different from other texts in some way to sell... how about writing a clear readable text with good code examples?   There is apparently no code in the text which is compilable (only code fragment) and obvious errors in some of these code fragments.  The writing and questions are ambiguous and unclear in many places.  I don't see why any university would choose to use this text.  Maybe the publisher is giving kickbacks to the department?!?  You could spend your money more wisely... such as on Sedgewick's Algorithms in C++, and a JAVA text such as Deitel and Deitel as a resource instead.. 
 This was the first (and will likely be the last) Resnick offering I've read.  I found it sophomorish and lacking in character development althought the story line was easy enough to follow.  At the same time, Resnick seems to be less interested in descriptive phraseology than in dialogue which was, surprisingly not bad at all.  I would expect young teens to rather enjoy this one 
 I installed this mirror in our car two days ago.  Today it was in my daughter's lap when I went to get her out of the car.  The mirror broke off from the base.  I bought it because it seemed safer than the other types of mirrors (suction cup attachment, etc).  I would not recommend this product 
 The book purports to analyze the Italian mind.  Rather it is very superficial and adds little insight to the field.  There is occasionally an amusing bit but overall, it is a bore 
 The recipes are fine, but the book does not contain an index or a table of contents.  Recipes are organized by time of day you might want to make them.  If you read cookbooks cover to cover then you'll be ok.  The only way to find a recipe is to flip through every page in the book.  
 This book is dated; the law changes at least one a month, sometimes more often. Your examiner doesn't live or work in the past or regard out-dated laws as useful tools for business. You will never know what is current, right or wrong when you trust a dated law book. NO. NO, NO, NO, GET SOMETHING NEWER 
   Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.   The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.   You can do better 
 I am a 38 year old adoptee and adoptive parent.  I was adopted as an infant, as was my own adopted daughter.  As others have pointed out, this book is clearly both overly negative and overly dramatic.  I would like to add that following the advice of the author could even be very harmful to your adopted child.  In particular, I was taken aback by the author's suggestion that you should essentially tell your child that he or she must have unresolved grief issues and help him or her uncover them.  That is just plain wrong.  Please understand that it is entirely likely that your child, especially if he or she was adpoted as an infant, will never have any significant feelings of loss or grief.  DO NOT CREATE THOSE FEELINGS OUT OF SOME MISGUIDED EFFORT TO HELP YOUR CHILD "UNCOVER" SUPPOSEDLY SUPPRESSED FEELINGS.  In my own experience, I have always known that I was adopted and that I have been loved by my parents.  I simply have no negative feelings regarding my own adoption.  None.  However, if my parents had read this book when I was a child and decided that they needed to tell me that I must have those feelings and we had to find them and focus on them, I undoubtedly would have needed years and years of therapy.  The advice in this book might have some helpful relevance to those who are adopted as older childen.  However, for those adopted a infants, what you should do is tell them early and often that they are adopted and loved.  Let them know that you are always available to talk with them about any feelings or questions they might have.  If they have questions, answer them matter of factly.  Do not burden them with negative feelings that they probably do not have and will never develop 
 I never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks. this Film was wack the Acting,Directing. but the Story Line was cool. in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger Cast this Film would have been interesting.this Film flip flopped Time Periods&it hurt it's cause.I will give Prince Props though for being a Black Film Director back at a time when it was really rare&truth be told in 2004 it ain't that much better on a whole 
 Yes, I bought this book with the hope of increasing my hope regarding writing.     First, I was first disappointed by the style of the author. The text rambled with anecdotes, that began to repeat themselves so insidiously by the middle of the book gave up and went to the last four chapters hoping there would be some more helpful and encouraging matter. Unfortunately, those chapters read like the earlier ones.     Second, I was surprised to find ninety-percent of the text were anecdotes strung together about horrible trials of famous and not-so-famous authors. The anecdotes are depressing, not hopeful. Quite honestly, reading about hundreds of authors, each of who sounded like Job in their trials, was depressing. Given I wouldn't fancy myself as a future Grisham or Rowling or whatever, reading awful stories about how they almost didn't make it don't inspire hope.     Books I have enjoyed much more include Zinsser "On Writing Well," which melds interesting stories with great writing and instruction; Stephen King's combination autobiography and how to, "On Writing"; and of course, keeping track of the guest columns in the New York Times on writing.. 
 A lot of the less familiar poetry in this collection is just plain terrible.  The baby boomer poets are the worst of all.  It's depressing.  You're better off with a Norton anthology 
 I'm sorry but this album was a huge let down. I usually like beats from Dre, Storch, Just Blaze, Swiss Beats, ect but here the beats are just dull and the lyrics aren't any better. This is my first Busta album so I can't judge him as an rapper just from one album but this was just garbage. Maybe not the worst of the year but it just didn't work for me.  Thumbs dow 
 Bring back Roy Marsden!  This guy was terrible.  What a shame to ruin a good story with a very bad actor 
 While I appreciated and generally agreed with the thesis Richard Florida puts forward that creativity is important for society, there were many times when I found his writing `style' to be annoying.  I had almost put the book down after completing the first third of it.  Mr. Florida's sensitivity to criticism and unabashed need to respond to every negative comment he received from his first book made me wonder just how narcissistic this man was.  His ego flows onto each page and sometimes, in my view, gets in the way of his work and feeds a perception that he is not completely objective.  There are many points that get overlooked in his analysis.  Why are people gravitating to Austin, Texas?  Mr. Florida postulates it is because the city is open to new ideas and diverse.  While I am certain that there are people who choose to relocate based on perceptions of how open and diverse a given area is, it makes more sense to look at more practical motivators such as taxes, real estate prices, crime rates, or climate.  Tangible factors such as these get little mention.  The assumption made by Mr. Florida is that a heterogeneous, open society is more creative than a homogenous, closed one.  I guess that Japan and South Korea don't count.  I could go on, but I would not recommend this book.  
 A friend recently loaned me the first few graphic novels in this series, and I have to say, the writing was like a zombie going through the motions, shambling forward in a sequence of uninteresting and predictable steps.  And like a zombie, this lacked the spark of life that I think distinguishes such comics as The Sandman, Fables, Last Man, etc.  Using zombies as a device should have been a no-brainer (pun intended), but to totally rely on this device without bringing more to the table gives one a huge sense of been there, done that.  While not a total disaster, this was definitely flat reading propped up by the occasional grotesque image to keep it in any way interesting 
 This book is very difficult to follow.  It isn't intended for beginners, I guess, but even novices will have trouble following the information here.  The circuits and ideas are good if all you want to do is build someone else's circuits, but if your goal is learning about microcontrollers, this one is somewhat poorly written and tough to follow.  Also, as other reviews have stated, expect MANY typographical errors 
 Movie: *1/2  DVD Quality: ****  DVD Extras: ***  Don't be fooled by the pedigrees of the distinguished cast and crew members; "In Dreams" is without doubt THE career low for director/screenwriter Neil Jordan as well as actors Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea, and even Robert Downey, Jr. (who's made a handful of turkeys throughout his rollercoaster career).  The film aspires to be a psychological mystery-suspense-thriller in the vein of "Psycho" and "The Silence of the Lambs", but is completely undone by a cut-and-paste script filled with unlikeable and unbelievable characters; uninspired direction; shallow performances; choppy editing; and a grossly ineffective musical score.  Only one scene in the movie is played convincingly, and that's the one in which Annette Bening finally begins to go over the edge mentally; pitching her voice in a lower tone and undergoing swift changes of emotion, Bening gives a brief and tantalizing glimpse of what she might have been able to achieve with a similar character in a better movie.  Unfortunately, that one scene does not make the chore of sitting through the other 97 minutes of pretention and tedium worthwhile.  In terms of technical quality, the DVD presentation of this bomb is more than acceptable.  Picture quality is clear and sharp; the sound is a bit fuzzy in one or two spots, but that may have been the intent of the filmmakers - I was so bored and so eager for the movie to be over that I didn't stop to replay the bits of dialogue in question.  The DVD extras are so-so: thumbnail cast and crew Biographies that mention much better movies; several lackluster screens filled with "Production Notes"; and finally, the Theatrical Trailer, which is probably the best thing on the disc because it's short and features quick flashes of the film's visual highlights.  "In Dreams" is not recommended viewing, even for those viewers who enjoy bad movies for their camp value 
 I bought this toy for my son for Christmas.  I thought he would enjoy the toy because he already likes to place balls and other items into baskets and he likes rattles.  Unfortunately the toy ended up being a disappointment because it is SO LOUD!  It scares him everytime I turn it on and there is no way to control the volume.  I know lots of kid toys are loud, but I have never heard one as loud as this one.  
 I found this book to be patronizing and condescending.  Maybe it's great for professional trainers who are also patronizing and condescending?  It seems likely that this book's success is largely dependent upon the publisher having a good marketing strategy. 
 	I Do not recommend this book because of the characters, the lack of a clear objective and the ending, that left me depressed and unsettled. Joel was one of the characters that bothered me. I didn't like the way he handled the situation when his friend died. The way he waited before telling anyone, and they way he acted angry at his parents and the Zabrinskys for no reason at all bothered me a lot. " `Joel', She said, `are you sure you've told us everything you know?' `About what?' he demanded roughly as if he didn't understand what she meant." Another thing I disliked about the book was, there wasn't a clear plot or objective to the story. After Tony's death, the rest of the book was basically about Joel trying to tell someone about it. I found that very boring. The last thing that left a discontented feeling in my mind was the ending. By the middle of the book, I was very sad, and by the end of the book, that feeling never went away. After Tony's death I found that there was no silver lining, or feel of hope at the end. This left me unhappy. The story just sort of cut off, leaving you sad and a little confused. Those were some key reasons I do not recommend the book On My Honor. 
 Full of completely illogical statements. The author seems to have just made up her diagnosis of the major diseases covered, as the diagnoses are highly unlikely and it seems that the author just made them up as she went along. Wow. Unfortunately the lowest score Amazon allowed me to set was 1. This book is not suitable for people of any age unless they are accustomed to chronic lies. Enjo 
 There are only a few items in this book that I think could be appropriately read at a funeral or memorial service 
 I like Daniels as a wrestler. He is Mr. TNA however this disk is very lacking. Most of these matches are already on the PPV disks. The AMV Vs. Triple X feud is awesome to say the least. However most of these matches are on the AMV Superstar disk. On most of the other superstar disks they interview the wrestler and get his views on things pertaining to wrestling. TNA did not even do that. It is not crappy wrestling. I just bought the disk when I already had all the matches. If you have all the TNA PPV disks I would not buy this disk. If you have none of the PPV's on DVD you will not be disappointed. I was because I have every TNA PPV disk and got nothing new on this on 
 I was very disappointed with this pump. It was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks, and I only used it once a day. Even more disappointing was the companys return policy. You have to ship it to them at your expense, wait for them to send you a new one, and return that one to the store. Do not waste your time 
 I heard of machinima about a week ago in the Economist magazine which also featured comments from Paul Marino, this book's author.  A week later and I've got the book, but I'm a little let down but what the book has added to my knowledge. I'd say someone who has only heard of machinima and hasn't designed their own level in a 3D game would get tons of gems from this book.  Whereas poor me with a week's worth of Google searches looking for tutorials on UnrealEd 3.0 and so forth - well I only got enough information to round out my status as a serious machinima beginner. In fairness, however, after a couple of hours with the book I was able to get the finishing touches I was looking for and successfully burned my first machinima movie to DVD.  So it was a small boost I got but a very welcome one (the boost included my spending $29 for the full version of Fraps).  So, yeah it will give you the tools in one place to get a finished product. I am disappointed that Marino ends the book with a tutorial on character modeling.  The tutorial is well-written  but by its end you'll be looking at a cute character cast in concrete (no words on skinning or rigging, etc). Worse this character will be stranded in a program called Silo (by the way blender from blender.org seems just as good and is cross-platform and a free download) with no hint of the challenge of getting this spaceman into a 3D level designer.   The machinima community would be better served with a tutorial on how to get custom sounds and meshes into UnrealEd et al, and how to do lipsynching. In short too much time spent teaching you how to use tools (tools generally come with their own instructions and tutorials anyway). I was also disappointed to find no samples of machinima movies on the cd.  These are such a pig to download after all.  How about including one and then some kind of analysis about what makes that one sample special.  The book is called the Art of Machinima but it seems more like the Activity of Futzing with Tools 
 It was the wrong cable and did not even fit the Garmin!  I phoned Garmin and they said they will send a replacement out.  Hopefully when it gets here it wil be the correct cable 
 articles weren't anything new. mostly fluff and cosmetic/clothes ads. better info and exercises in Oxygen and Women's M&F. 
 I have followed Bruce Hornsby for over 20 years and own every album he has ever come out with including two concert DVDs.  I was reluctant to buy intersections due to owning all the other, but if you have been to  Hornsby concert you know that he always keeos things fresh..no exception here.  I loved the DVD of some of his performances.  There are treasures here, Imagine, solo on the Piano at an awards show, the Star Spangled Banner at the World Series with Marsalis, and his performance with BB King.it is a must for the hard core hornsby fan 
 Despite some evident talent, this Band of Horses never gets out of the paddock.  Probably one of the most strangled sounding CDs I've ever heard, the fish bowl vocals constantly fight with the rhythm guitars, but neither ever manage to break out: the vocals failing to produce a shred of emotion (or clarity) and the guitars always a couple of steps from a melody.  With the exception of perhaps one or two numbers, each track stays in exactly the same mid-range making for a truly dull and repititious listening experience.  As noted by others on this board, BOH does indeed sound like a My Morning Jacket (recorded in a silo) knockoff, albeit without the passion, lead guitar, or lengthy takes.    Ultimately, I'd rather listen to Neil sing "Cowgirl in the Sand" for the 4,876,386th time. 
 I don't know who this book is supposed to be for.  Certainly not someone who wants to learn any of the featured games.  It's assumed you already know the games well.  Certainly not anyone already playing much tournament poker.  Perhaps the delusional player who is just starting to play in tournaments and wants to play in every available event at once.  The book is just silly.  There are a grand total of 20 pages on no-limit hold 'em for example, and most of those are repetative.  In other words, Tom easily could have put 10 pages that say the same thing into the fine book he co-wrote with T.J. Cloutier.  The "advice" mostly consists of Tom rephrasing the very problem you probably wanted answered. In the brief section on strategic concepts, for instance, Tom repeats in several different sections the need to stay calm and guard against making errors based on personal dislike of an opponent.  He says things like take a deep breath after a bad beat (well, duh!).  What he doesn't say, are things like how to adjust your play if you've got a very aggressive player to your immediate left (which is useful to know).  He says things like "The champions know when to push a marginal hand and when to back away from it," but makes no attempt to try to quantify how or when they know this.  So it isn't very helpful.  The chapter on playing poker as a business is probably useful, except it's only useful if you're good in the first place and if you are you aren't reading this book, you're saving your $30 and playin poker with it.  There are much better books out there and unless you are going to run right out and enter tournaments in every event, pick up a book that deals with the game in which you want to excel and stick to that.  The stuff in here you can find in articles on-line, or figure out playing poker on-line 
 FIVE STARS, NOT TWO....F.F. Bruce is well known and respected far and wide for his honesty as a Christian scholar and apologist. This slim volume, 123 pgs, is true to form despite that as a Christian Bruce has a pre-ordained agenda to defend. Consider his painful honesty in this statement: "indeed, it may be we know nothing certain about the teacher into whose mouth the narrative is put; the story of Jesus as it has come down to us may be myth or legend, but the teaching ascribed to him, whether he was actually responsible for it or not, has a value all its own." How unlike the rabid fundamentalists who insist ever word is inspired of God, error free. He touches on many problem areas, but unfortunately does not develop them as he could have. Some areas not touched are more developed in his contributions to the book "Hard Sayings of the Bible", but even there, some elementary obvious problems, such as the two differing birth accounts of Jesus in Matthew vs. Luke, or the differences in the passion week account of John vs. the synoptics are mentioned in passing, but not developed. "The N.T. documents;are they reliable" thus introduces one to the existence of such areas of controversy, but that is all. It does more to establish the historicity of the accounts as being in the general time period they claim, particularly via Luke, with no less than eighteen historic contemporaries to challenge the reader to test the account validity. He reviews traditional Christian arguments to establish the accounts reliability such as what caused Paul to take such a direct about face from intense persecution to being a foremost leader in Christianity, yet acknowledging in the same chapter that Paul, whose writings are prior to the gospels, is only mentioned in Luke/Acts. Thus while doing a good job to establish the historicity of the New Testament accounts, Bruce also does not hedge on the internal problems of consistency of theology and event accuracy in reporting. He also acknowledges Mark being almost entirely incorporated into Matthew & Luke, and the Q document. Very recommendable due to it's honesty, and a good book for those beginning the subject, but lacking in development in looking at some of the specific events mentioned.    
 To the east of Mogadishu is the Indian Ocean and to the west is the African continent. In this movie, sunrise and sunset are both to the east. DOH! Never mind detail blunders like a 50 caliber gun shown closeup as an M60, or the C2 Blackhawk shown by Orion surveillance above as a Huey, or the Somali mobs shown at high noon while Hoot's Humvee is shown at late afternoon at the same time, most people would not notice. They can fool us with pyrotechnics here but not with celestial bodies 
 these guys are whack.. this just shows how easy it is to become a rap artist these days.  this album doesnt hold one good song its terrible. its true you cannot spell crap with out a R-A-P.  want a good album CHROME- STRAIGHT TO THE PROS     
 Gives a good overview to US-Philippines economic, social and political relations.  Good detail yet easy to read due to a well developed writing style. The authors' many anecdotal observations were annotated, thereby helping to reveal potential biases, unlike many writings.  Strongly recommended for any studies of Philippines 20th century history. 
 I know this film has some historical significance being the first British feature-length animated film and all, but to the modern viewer who has never had the privilege to read Orwell's masterpiece this film is a watered-down injustice due to the added humor in the story (I don't remember anything about a playful baby duck) and the tacked on "happy" ending.  Some other things that I found bothersome were the slow pace and the distracting humming sound.  Read the book instead, it's short and won't take you too long.  MTV will still be there when you get finished. 
 I'm not going to waste your time with a book review that's as long as the book itself, so I'm going to get straight to the point and say I absolutely loved this book. Though I love stories/movies of this genre, I'd never read a Tom Clancy novel before reading Executive Orders. That's about to change. A large portion of this book is about how Jack Ryan learns to become president, which by its nature makes this a very political story. However, it was written so that readers not up-to-speed on political know-how and jargon (like myself) could easily understand and follow along. Basically, you learn about the presidency and its twists and turns just as President Ryan learns, and I think that's what makes this book unbelievably easy to read...despite its 1,300-plus pages. In short, this was one hell of a story that I couldn't put down. I even learned a thing or two. Totally worth the price of admission, five stars 
 Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks.... 
 I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you 
 The title is truly misleading.  The authors "Interior Design" Business is a window covering business.  She sells window coverings, flooring and wallcoverings but is apparantly not a designer.  Don't expect  any in depth advice on working with clients creating integrated room plans,  using trade-only showrooms etc. If you want to focus on one aspect of the  business, simply selling floor or window coverings, great. But, I feel  cheated even though this book was inexpensiv 
 This is a stupid book.  I got about half way through and stopped reading.  Blech.  Stilted language and not one character to root for.  The main character (Jane McGuire) is petulant, rude and for all her "worldliness" is very childish.  She seems to be constantly stamping her beautiful little foot and uttering "Damn you!!!"  She insists on doing as she pleases and all the responsible adults around her roll over, declare that she knows best, and allow her to do it.  And she is such an irresistible "woman" that 34 year old Mark Trevor salivates over her (this part is just weird) as do almost all of the other male characters.  And she is portrayed to be so much older than 20 year old Jock and 23 or so Mario.  Puh-lease.  Oh, yeah.  Ya gotta love how the ridiculous plot includes ancient treasure, international terrorism, and numerous references to 9/11 and Homeland Security.  Ooohh.  This is my first IJ book and surely my last.  I got to page 250 before bailing on it.  What was the publisher thinking 
 These do work great for organizing CDs and DVDs, and I do still use them, but I found that the two inside CDs/DVDs can become scratched by a small plastic ridge that runs down the middle of the page. I kept my TV DVDs in these pages for awhile, and discovered that all the discs on the inside of the pages had been scratched along this ridge. A few of my Simpsons discs still won't play certain episodes. So I keep all the discs on the outside slots only, and I've never had another problem with them. I use the inside slots for liner notes/episode lists, though I usually have to trim them to make them fit right 
 Simply put, this was an awful disappointment. James Michener is one of my favorite authors, but I remember when he came to Kent to do the research for this book, and he evidently didn't do any himself, because the inaccuracies in this book outnumber the truths. It's so poorly put together that I stopped reading any of his books for several years after this one came out. Do not -- I repeat, do NOT -- base your perceptions of what happened in Kent on the material presented in this book. There have been so many other books written since then that are more accurate -- pick any of them. Better yet, read several. Everybody seems to have a different idea of what really happened anyway. As a member of the KSU class of 1970, I had several friends who were there that day, and some of them couldn't talk about it for 25 years. This is not a subject to be dismissed so lightly with so little regard for the truth. My feeling is that this was a true American tragedy that didn't need to happen, and only did happen because of political power, arrogance, and greed 
 What I found annoying about this book, it that it is so obvious that the Violet character is some kind of self-portrait and that Bill Wechsler is a portrait Paul Auster. For anyone who knows even the basic facts about the Hustvedt-Auster couple it is impossible to overlook. Bill is said to be very handsome in a "Byronic" kind of way, he is an artist, he has a sibling who is mentally ill, his father was emotionally detached, he excelled in sports at school and has a strong moral codex, he has a son by his first wife, and then met his "true" love Siri/Violet etc. All of which is also true of Paul Auster. Violet is from Minnesota, of Norwegian descent, as is Siri Hustvedt, and I am sure the similarities go on. I find it slightly sickening when the writer invents a male character, Leo, who goes on to detail his sexual fantasies about Violet in the book. Siri Hustvedt is clearly a very gifted writer, but I wish she would write a novel where the clues from her own personal life are not strewn about all over the place. What worries me also is that the character Mark in "What I loved" so closely resembles the delinquent in Austers "Oracle night". 
 (4 & 1/2 stars for the tunes, zero for the concept)  With so many Steely Dan hits collections and/or sets already out, the question is whether there's really any valid reason for this latest collection to exist.  The answer is that besides the usual songs from the past, there are also two songs from the recent albums on this hits collection, just TWO SONGS.  (That's one each from Two Against Nature and Everything Must Go, but I guess that's enough for this CD to get the title of "the only career-spanning collection" on the front cover sticker.)  Otherwise, this is basically just another repackaging of the same old - but great - material.  Adding to the problem is the Dan's perfectionist nature, one that prevents the release of ANY outtakes or other "extra" tracks.  Nor apparently do they record new songs to go on a "hits" disc.  They just do not put any bonus tracks on box sets or compilations (except for one lone live cut on the Citizen Steely Dan box).   So this boils down to another greedy attempt to make money off the back catalog.  These songs are among my most loved tunes ever, but I also don't like this endless repackaging of the same songs over and over.. 
 So my 8-year-old daughter comes up to me and says "Mommy, why do boys like to see women naked?" Where did she get that idea? From reading "Mickey and Me." Pages 34-35 and sprinkled throughout the book the main character, a 13-year-old boy, is blantantly sexually excited by the site of naked women. He talks about seeing them all "naked as the day they were born", saying that the site was "more beautiful than the Grand Canyon", wishing that he had his camera with him, mentioning he had never seen naked women before except for Joe Jackson's wife and that was only for a 1/2 second. And then he says that the site of all these naked women has been his fantasy since he was 11-years-old. Now, I have no doubt that the above thoughts and feelings might be typical for a 13-year-old boy, but 1)the back of my daughter's book said it was for ages 8-12 which is far too young to have the subject of lust introduced. And, even if this book was for a slightly older group, the lust element is completely inappropriate to the subject matter of going back in time and meeting great baseball players. 2) Girls, like my daughter, might also read this book looking to see the women in the women's baseball league as role models and great athletes not sexual objects. 3)No matter how typical the main character's thoughts and feelings it remains that his attitude is demeaning to women and sends a terrible message out to both boys and girls. My daughter wanted to know if she should take off her clothes for the pleasure of the men in her life! Honestly! Dan Gutman and his publisher should be ashamed of themselves. We will certainly not be allowing anymore Dan Gutman books into our house. My kids don't need to be sexualized so young 
 This is one of those books where you like the idea of the book but not the book itself.  This book didn't really make me feel anything. I never got so that I cared about the characters. I never came to feel that the characters cared about each other either.  This is one of the books that you know you read but you just can't really remember later on. I wouldn't recommend this 
 There are very few movies that I haven't finished watching.  This now goes on the short list.  Luckily I didn't rent this one and instead was excited to see it on TiVo, that is until after 30+ minutes in I was hoping a vampire would kill me.  This film while it has an R rating and there is a reason why, even the toned down TV version was extremely graphic, from pulling out someone's tongue, watching a vampires head blow up and catch fire in the sun to blood spray.  There isn't anything wrong with a good horror movie but graphic violence to fill time (so you don't have to have actors say anything) seems a bit of a waste.  The premise of a rag tag bunch of vampire hunters joining forces to defeat evil could have been a great movie.  But, the low budget, director chosen and filming of this movie won't make it a classic on anyone's list.  In addition the movie was WAY OVERACTED.  I don't know if everyone was trying to make the film better or what but the overacting made it to the point that it made the acting look horrible.  It got to the point I no longer cared who won a battle.  As I said this is one of less than a dozen movies I have been looking forward to seeing that I couldn't even finish.    Gets 1 star cause I can't give it less 
 I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff.  I was going to go totally wireless (4 units) and luckily didn't run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers. I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers, as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there. If the Pelican holds up, (model PL-2050 version 2.0) I might go get some more if I can find them locally. 
 Sigh...  Like most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's sheet music, selections from Phantom of the Opera gives you a watered-down transcription featuring many cuts.  Even worse, the accompaniment is hardly the original accompaniment at all, rather it simply follows the vocal line.  This might be acceptable for fans who simply want to play through the music on their parlor piano without a vocalist, but for a real musical theater fan, it's very disappointing.  So far, I've only found one place which gives an accurate transciption of the accompaniment (an excerpt from the full piano-vocal score).  The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Soprano, Vol. 3, compiled by Richard Walters features "Think of Me" and "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again" in their original form.  For performers and accompanists alike, there's something to get excited about.  So far, we're still waiting on more from the Phantom of the Opera, but they're creating a 4th edition of the Anthologies soon, so watch out 
 NOTICE: this is not really a sequel.  This is one of those Television movie/mini-series remakes of a theatrical release.  You will not get cinematic visuals, you will get TV quality visuals.  Too many people are not providing appropriate reviews and this is more a betrayal of your consumer bethren.  The original Storm Riders is an amazing fantasy tale, this is not.  This is more like a standard kung fu action flick that uses the characters.  Storm Riders had that fantasy feel, this does not.  There is good kung fu action, but this thing seems incoherent while you are trying to watch it, and that may be because they have tried to cut and paste the movie together, if my theory is correct in that it was a miniseries adaptation.  The story starts and stops with no flow.  If you just want an action flick with some decent fight scenes get this, it's tolerable, but in no way is it on the caliber of Storm Riders.  I really wish they establish a standard that differentiates the TV adaptations from real theatrical releases, such releases tend to be a bit insulting.  The ONLY thing that is redeeming for this is a really cute female actor, and that's it!  I've never seen Wind and Cloud so unattractive, and this is based off Aaron Kwock and Ekin Cheng.  These 2 are appropriate, but no substitute 
 The first two or three tracks are good but the supporting instrumentals and vocals are poor.  The supporting instrumental on track 6 was so bad I thought the cd had a defect.  In other places, the supporting music is  barely audible.  The only singing occurs on track 12.  I would recommend  getting the cd "Picture This".  It's much better 
 Tediously long and weary. Nothing interesting, just a lot of borrowed ideas from RTCW, HL2, etc. I am sick of this 
 Not too long after I purchased this camera the screen turned white when I turned it on. I would turn it off and on and nothing would help. Finally I would take the batteries out and put them back in. This seemed to fix the problem a few times. After that I thought it was just operator error. But it wasn't. The camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. So after being annoyed I left the camera alone for awhile. An event came up about a month later. I got my camera and tried to turn it on. Nothing happened. So I changed the batteries. Still nothing happened. I'm not sure what happened. I do believe I purchased a LEMON camera. I'm hoping to resolve these issues with Samsung. It was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. So I guess you get what you pay for! 
 These are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless, juiceless and unburgerlike in texture.  Completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket.  I will never buy Omaha Steak products again.  Omaha Steaks' customer representatives are very nice however.  I wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said I could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card.  Thank you very much. 
 Once again the music industry must ask why so many users are turning to online P2P services, such as WINMX, Face facts, here is a Celine Dion's Greatest hits, and it does not include all her greatest hits. Instead they leave off songs such as WHERE DOES MY HEART BEAT NOW, and WATER FROM THE MOON, among others, WHY??? Simple, its a CASH GRAB!!! More than likely in a year or two they will release a double CD set with the previously mentioned tunes and more filler, as this CD has. HELLO!!!!!!!!!!! Wake up to reality and put all her greatest hits on 1 cd, and stop the GREED. Too many times you see greatest hits complilations from a group or artist and they have purposely left off great charted tunes, so they can put out yet another CD to make money. Once again trying to soak the consumer for more cash. Time to boycott these record company thieves. No offence too online CD services such as CD now or others, they are great and only deliver what is given to them 
 I was looking for more information.  Thought it was over priced for what I got 
 The link remover is too flimsy to work.  I can't even say it works poorly.  One of the two tweezers is missing.  The case is nice 
 Crikey!!!! What is this chunder? Wait a minute....art students from "Down Under" get together and make fun little songs while watching reruns of "The Wiggles", decide they can market these tunes to an adoring fan base! Yeah, this stuff could be the soundtrack to "Forrest Gump" alright. "Run, Forrest, run! Run as fast as you can from this crap!!!" And these guys are touring, too? Are they touring with Barney & Friends?  There is not one thing of value to this other than that the CD itself makes a handy coaster for your Foster's.. 
 I should have done extensive research prior to buying this book, it lacks a very important feature in my opinion, the sample pictures have no information on how it was taken, no shutter speed, ISO lens or F-stop guides. I later found such a book, but I will allow you to do your own research 
 I couldn't wait to receive this book, today it finally came and I went thru it in about five minutes....yes it has some entertaining ideas and pictures(some) it just did not go into detail.  You will be better off getting ideas from surfing the net.  Save your money!! 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 This is a very simple review.  Call it a warning.  This album by GM is cheesy, period.  The squeaky vocals and the weak synth lines are far inferior to GM's other album, "From Here to Eternity."  On that cd, the tracks are very trancy, features electro vocals and nice chord changes.  The beat is stronger and harder.  Especially good, besides the title track, is track #6: "First Hand Experience in Second Hand Love."  Excellent techno riff that lacks the cheesey vocals, dated Expose sound effects and stabs.   It just rolls and rolls and rolls.  Nice driving cd.  However, E=MC2 is a cd to pass on.  I was very disappointed.  One more note, this album sounds old and dated.  "Eternity" could still work a dancefloor now.  No one would think it's almost 30 years old 
 Come on.  This is a book by Jim Belushi.  Need I say more 
 Yes, I love Microsoft Office. It's incredibly user friendly, it has wonderful features, most of which I don't even know how to use, and it's spelling and grammar checking features are the best of it's kind. I've been fortunate enough to have been a student up to now in my life and therefore did not have to buy Microsoft for my personal use, the school would always buy one for me. And of course there are always illegitimate means... but I'm not advocating piracy here.  However, I would be the last person on earth to consider using Microsoft Office if I had to pay $350 for it. It's an insane price. consider the alternatives:  Open Office: Does everything MS Office does, some things even better. I love how you don't need to buy or install anything extra to type mathematical formulas in Open Office. The best thing about this, however, is that it's FREE!  Google Docs and Spreadsheets: This one is even better. Not only is it free like everything else from Google, you can COLLABORATE IN REAL TIME with  anybody else on the internet to write your word documents! Nothing beats that, it's just the most wonderful thing that Google has done 
 This is the textbook used (still) by my EE program.  Why a book published in 1980 is still the only required text for a Systems and Signals class in 2005, I'll never know(seems like something would have changed in the world of electronics in the past 25 years).  This book is nearly impossible to learn from by studying independently.  Very few examples, and at least half of every page is taken up by underexplained equations.  Very hard to follow on the undergrad level.  For the undergrad student, I highly recommend the book by Lathi.  It much easier to understand and study on your own.  After buying the Lathi book, I went from being struggling for hours upon hours trying to understand a theory to having a concise, very easy to follow reference that greatly cut my study time down.    Since this book is out of print, probably very few people have it as a required text.  I do not recommend trying to learn from this book.  However, it can be useful to someone who understands the majority of the concepts presented in this book who wants a reference without a lot of explanation. This book is basically a large formula sheet.   
 Teri Hatcher is one of my favorite actresses. I think she is honest, and charming. But this book reveals too much about her insecurities and inadequacies at age 40. It has funny life stories mixed in, but the rest is just an account of how inadqeuate she feels and has always felt. Its sad. I think those thoughts would be better shared with a therapist. 
 Chapter by chapter I could not understand why I continued to read this book.  This is one of the worst story lines I have read.  The only thing missing from the cast was a homosexual mime.  You ask why did I give it a one star rating?     1.  It's the lowest rating available.   2.  The book is spelled correctly.   3.  The pages are in correct numerical order.  That's as good as it gets.  Save your money 
 As a contemporary of Joan Baez (age-wise), I loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice.  I even empathize with much of her politics, but unfortunately it's time she rested on her laurels.  Her voice on this CD is quite far removed from what she was once capable of, and in fact I would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on Bowery Songs, and her earlier quality.  Like some professional athletes, she seems to not know when to quit... 
 As can be judged by the positive reviews given to this book, Shahak had played into the hands of anti-Semites and pseudo-scholars alike - if it wasn't his intent for writing this book in the first place.  Amongst a great number of other instances of intentionally concealed anti-Semitic attacks masquerading as an instance of objective analysis are:   *Claiming that Maimonides was an anti-black racist.  Shahak deliberately fails to mention the fact that NOT holding racist views of the black race was a very rare occurance in the 12th century Europe and Asia amongst ALL ranks of society.  *Claiming that Jews permit adult sexual relations with minors.  This is a very popular slander amongst anti-Semites used against Jews; needless to say, this is a completely false allegation that has no grounds in the Talmud.  Actually, the Talmud discusses whether the victim of such activity, which is expressly FORBIDDEN by Judaism, should be considered virgin at the time of their marriage.  *Claiming that the Talmud treats gentiles abusively and providing passages from Talmud as evidence.  Shahak, like all other anti-Semites in disguise, fails to mention that such laws were originated by gentiles, and officialy vindicated by European law, AGAINST the Jews living in Europe, who then adopted similar laws to vindicate themselves.  Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.  Apparently, Europeans used Christianity's teachings to live an ascetic life as an excuse to cover up their jealousy of Jewish success and endlessly persecute them.  I could go on exposing Shahak for who he really is, but I simply don't need to, as I expect and hope that these three examples will suffice to convince any potential reader of this book that its content is neither objective nor productive to expanding your view of the Jewish faith as it really is. 
 Nothing is clear in this book, it is not organized and not well writing. Filled with charts that are dispersed wherever and not easy to understand.  Frankly it is an advertising of the Investor Business Daily, IBD, please subscribe and you will make money, I lost my respect to Mr. O'Neils when he ended the book by the testimonials from Investors. He even wrote if you deal with a broker who didn't attend his class!! It is a worst investor. 
 This book starts with a simple question and assertion.  Most scholars claim Captain Cook was taken for a God when he arrived in Hawaii(much as Cortez in Mexico) but this book claims that this narrative is 'racist' and 'eurocentric' and a classic 'imperialistic myth'.  The idea here is that the narrative assumed Cook was a god(not that he was mistakenly taken for one) because the racist Europeans of the 18th century beleived Europeans really were gods to the 'natives'.    But this argument falls apart when one realizing what it is based on.  The book wants to be the new 'Orientalism' and the author claims that as a 'Sri Lankan' he is best placed to judge what Hawaaians a dozen generations ago thought of a European.  How rediculous.  THe difference between Sri Lanka in the 20th century and Hawaii in the 18th is as different as Captain Cook's culture in England in the 18th and the culture of the Hawaiians.  The racist assertion that a Sri Lankan can better judge a Hawaiian than a European is unfounded, perhaps the best person to judge a Hawaiin is a Hawaiian but it doesnt logic that a Sri Lankan would be better than a British person.  Thus the idea presented her is simply wrong headed.  It would have been better had this book re-examined how Polynesians and Hawaiians in particular viewed Cook, rather than claim that every piece of the Cook story is 'racist'.  What was Cook supposed to do?  Not sketch the people he encountered, not write about them, he was in fact being very forward thinking in bothering to learn about the cultures he visited.  Seth J. Frantzman  
 This book simultaneously talks down to the reader, while assuming he/she is very knowledgabe in international affairs and recent history.  It is a compilation of brief vignettes and anecdotes loosely tied into 293 pages.  Don't waste your time.  Read one of Ann Coulter's books instead, you'l get more out of it and enjoy it more 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 The item arrived to us the week of Christmas three weeks after we had ordered it.  It arrived with several broken and several missing parts.  Amazon would not send us new parts, they would only replace the unit if we shipped it back first.  This was to be a Christmas gift to my son, so that was not optional.  Had the order arrived when the order tracking said it would I would have had time to return it 
 I am a huge Thrice fan, and I love every album that they have done up to this point.  If you like any of Trice's earlier albums this album will surely put you to sleep.  It is a total change from punk/hardcore to a mellow, easy listening, pseudo Cold Play music. The radio friendly We Are the Invisible is the only half way decent track on the album, but you'll be sick of it after you listen to it twice.  This album is boring, lyrically weak, and bears no resemblance to anything Thrice has ever done. If you like anything you've ever heard by Thrice buy any other album but this one 
 I got a copy of this book a few years back as a Christmas gift, and the title and cover immediately put me off (and I'm really not the type that judges a book by it's cover).  It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel.  Big mistake on my part.  The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral.  It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book.  But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym.  Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring.  Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring 
 I have three complaints about this edition of Tocqueville: 1) Nowhere in the book is the translator credited.  This violates basic principles of publication and scholarship. 2) This is in fact an abridged version of the original English-language translation by Henry Reeve, dating from sometime before 1862.  Unless you want to re-create the experience of a modern Frenchman confronted with de Tocqueville's somewhat archaic French by reading the text in somewhat archaic English, I would seek out any of the more recent translations: there are at least three. 3) The ellipses, that is, the abridgements, have sometimes been made to conceal some of the author's less flattering views America. In fact I suspect this is a "patriotic" abridgement. For example, in the second chapter of part one, Heffner has omitted references to some of the excesses of Puritan law in New England which the notoriously even-handed Tocqueville had cited 
  I first heard about this book in a graduate level Latin American survey course.  I kept it in the back of my mind and finally got around to reading it years later.  The professor had described it glowingly and subsequent references to it that I came across were all very positive.  Consequently I really looked forward to reading this book.  I was extremely disappointed.  Published in 1938 I would say that overall the book has aged badly.  It is overly dramatic, even emotionally silly in parts. The plot is insipid.  The Mexican characters are not Mexican but European with a little Mexican airbrushing.  The indigenous people are portrayed as one-dimensional simians.    I read that prior to writing the book Graham Greene spent a total of eight weeks in Mexico.  It sadly shows.   He has little understanding of Mexico.  I can't understand the continuing hoopla surrounding this work.  If you want to read some decent fiction about early twentieth century Mexico try something by B. Traven. 
 I don't usually do fiction, but have picked up a few excellent reads in that category. This isn't one of the best. For those who prefer nonfiction, and who are seeking a concept of god they can live with in good concscience, check out God Without Relgion by Sankara Saranam. 
 What we must all realize is that one of the most important reasons people loved Co-Flow's "Funcrusher" was because of the lyrics.  The never-ending one liners were what really made it a classic, though the beats were undeniably funky, dark, and all around great.  That being said, when one sees an all instrumental album from Co-Flow you know you won't be able to hear any jewels of hip-hop wisdom, but you do expect a certain level of bang on the beats.  These instrumentals for the most part seem boring and tired, as if they were beats not deemed good enough for the "Funcrusher" album.  I expected alot from this album and instead got rather boring tracks that went on for too long.  Normally I could excuse this, but these are too lazy to even freestyle to, which is the main reason I pick up instrumental albums.  "Little Johnny" is a big disappointment, if its instrumentals you want, pick up El-P's "Fan Dam Plus" instead 
 This model is a nice little pepper mill: relatively easy to fill, easy to use, and reasonably priced.  Unfortunately, performance leaves a lot to be desired.  Turn the handle one direction and the pepper is very coarse; I would described it as cracked rather than ground.  Turn the handle the other direction and it grinds so fine that nothing comes out.  Perhaps if the mechanism were adjusted it would work; unfortunately I can't figure out what that adjustment would be.  Based on other reviews, I'm guessing my experience is a quality control issue.  If it worked I would be happy.  As it is, I'm purchasing yet another pepper mill. 
 When used as a self-study text, I found the book to be lacking a sufficient quantity of example problems solved in adequate detail to be truly helpful 
 This book is an excellent reference book for the serious ghost hunter / paranormal investigator. Provides good case histories as well as "ghost stories" that can be used as examples on investigations 
 Another enjoyable read, quicker than most because you don't have to think. It's not much of a mystery, and the Siamese cats really have little to do with its solution but provide a clever title. Mostly they give Braun a chance to ooh and ahh over the inexplicable ways of cats. It was many books ago that Koko actually provided a useful clue to his host, Mr. Q, the genial bachelor billionaire who is every tame girl's wish. Mostly this is a tale from Moose County, 400 miles north of anywhere. If you don't know what I'm talking about, this is certainly not right place for you to pick up this series.    Brrr is celebrating its 200th anniversary with Scots, a giant cake, bland good will from everyone, and Qwilleran's second historical disaster radio show up on stage. That's pretty exciting, too, when we get to hear the whole script. Oh, sure, there's a bad happening or two in town, but don't let that put you off for they occur well out of view. There's also good times with Q's good friends, and a subplot about an old lady, her fabulous antiques, and her mercenary granddaughter. There's no significant development in the relationships among any of Braun's stock characters--you know who I mean. To top off a pleasantly fluffy read, Braun appends two of Q's favorite delicious recipes. A quintessential summer beach read, guaranteed to pass a few hours pleasantly. 
 Overall, I would say this book was pretty boring.  I like books that have more dialogue and action than description and details.  The one thing this book had plenty of was description and details.  It seemed like Lahiri gave way too much background information and didn't tell enough about the actual story as it pertained to Gogol.  I was really looking forward to reading this book because the movie preview made the movie seem pretty good.  I have a feeling this would still be a good movie, but just not a very good book.  If you don't want to be very entertained and enthused, then read this book.  Otherwise, I would choose something with more action and entertainment 
 I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average "bad guys on the run" movie.  Gee, Billy Bob Thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn't like cops at all; he even uses bad language!  A friend was watching it with me and he thought I was watching the Lifetime channel. This movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard 
 I've seen many reviewers argue that the use of DDT to prevent malaria deaths in the developing world is unjustified because 1) it may cause greater long-term harm to the environment, and 2) mosquitoes will eventually develop resistance to the insecticide.  One San Francisco reviewer even claimed "We have no idea of how many millions, or billions, of people globally have been impacted by its use in the forms of debilitating illnesses and death from cancer and the like." According to her, it's irresponsible to use DDT when we have no idea to what extent the negative impact, if any (although "billions of people" is a bit ridiculous), is of using it.  But there's no question what the negative impact has been of banning it: millions and millions of preventable deaths. So some environmentalists are apparently more than happy to allow an absolute--millions dead--in exchange for an unknown.  Part of the reason why it's so easy for them to trade lives for theory is that they don't give much day to day thought about malaria. It's a disease that doesn't worry people in the developed world. It happens "over there" in the third world, and if we actually get it over here, well, no worries--we get treated and fully cured with relatively affordable drugs. Who in the West actually worries day to day about dying from malaria contracted from a mosquito bite? It ranks up there with polio and typhoid.   But what would the "ban DDT no matter what the cost" environmentalists be saying if HIV suddenly became transmittable by mosquitoes? Would they continue to argue "we have no idea how many millions of people have been impacted by DDT's use" if they were one mosquito bite away from a death sentence with no cure (as peoples of the third world don't have or can't afford a cure for malaria)?  Nope, you can bet your bottom dollar virtually every one of them would change their tune pretty quickly--especially here in San Francisco. All their objections about "long term damage to the environment" and "resistance to insecticide" would suddenly transform into a mere theory once faced with the possibility their own lives could be in mortal danger. Activists would be storming the streets demanding the return of DDT with the same vengeance they exhibit today when marching for a solution to HIV/AIDS. Because it's a different story when it's no longer someone else's life that's on the line.  And hence we would have an even clearer expression of the hypocrisy of the new environmental imperialism they impose on the third world today--the kind that makes activists feel better about themselves from the comfort of latte studios and Volvo station wagons. Every day they tell the third world "we have cures for these diseases that you don't, so it matters not to us that our environmental crusade will take away your line of defense and you die by the millions" in exchange for good conversation at Starbucks. It's an easy trade when mosquito-borne death isn't tugging at *your* arm every day. 
 I was not pleased with this cook book. Despite all the positive reviews I was disappionted. When I first saw the recipe using a can of soup I knew it wasn't for me. I do love the Sopranos but as far as cooking goes I will look elsewhere for my Italian recipes. 
 The techniques described in this book are not something to play around with. If someone seriously attempts to follow these practices, there is the real possibility of becoming severely, phsycologically unbalanced. These  practices are meant to serve a purpose, but the author of this book NEVER  mentions that purpose. Without a use for the 'cultivated energy', energy  levels WILL build up to dangerously high levels. Be warned 
 Read the reviews. This is not a photography book. It is a book on psychology. As a photographer I give this 1 star. This may very well be a good psycology book 
 I checked this book out from the library hoping to learn more about JK Rowling, but I was disappointed.  It provided very little about her, more about Harry Potter than anything else.  Most of what's in here you can find in interviews she has done in the past.  Something that really irritated me was the constant jumping around this book did.  It would be describing something at a specific period in JK's life, then jump ahead 5 years and describe something else, then jump back 8 years, and so on.  That was really confusing at first and really irritating.  There are probably much better books, don't bother reading this, you won't learn anything new 
 The ear phones broke the first week I purchased the device.  Don't waste your money 
 I did not even finish this!!... I have No idea what this book was trying to get across... I give Bono credit for the hard work he is doing for Aids but I do not understand where or what this conversation???  was all about...Sorry Bono, I am a big fan of your music, but this book was so confusing and not at all enlightening 
 The amount of praise given to this work does not surprise me given that there is a widespread, yet subtle, socialist movement in America as well as in Europe.  Despite this, the book is a failed attempt at reconciling the ideal with reality.  Rawls commits one of the many age-old flaws of collectivism, attempting to force morality on immoral beings. Rawls' entire work is fundamentally flawed in that the hypothetical situation from which the entire theory relies, selectively allows certain knowledge, assumptions, etc. while conveniently eliminating others.  For instance, empirical evidence that shows capitalism outperforms other economic systems cannot be known in the original position.  This is profound when one considers that we live in a hostile world that requires nations to invest in security of which economic power is imperative.  Thus, capitalism may be a necessary injustice in order to safeguard liberal democracy.  If we compare the human condition prior to capitalism, one can see that perhaps a collectivist system that may contribute to capitalism's downfall is immoral, if it leads us back in this direction.  Consequentalism perhaps?  Despite this, the people in the original position cannot have this knowledge.  Therefore, information that is direly relevant to the construction of a social system in a hostile world cannot be used in determining its structure.  Somehow though, the people do understand the important of the right to vote, equality, etc. This is absurd and impractical.  Rationale beings need to analyze as much information as is available and pertinent to any decisions they make.  Rawls continuously attempts to explain his "tweaks" as rationale but it is obvious that they are all implemented in order to discount human nature and proceed in theoretical terms.  On a side note, Rawls' first principle calls for the right to vote, what would his state do if citizens began to vote for a more capitalistic system that defied his "justice"?  Iron fist?  Nevertheless, it is quite obvious what Rawls is attempting here.  In a hypothetical situation where we all have to fear being born without intelligence, strength, status etc. we will take the safe route and ensure ourselves the highest index of goods.  This may be true, or it may not (human nature seems to embrace risk taking) however this situation is irrelevant because of its exclusion of relevant information.  Hobbes for instance accepted human nature and the potential for a wide array of circumstances in his hypothetical Natural Condition.  While Rawls may have some strong arguments in declaring that his two principles are the epitome absolute justice, this does not mean they are practical in a hostile world.  Essentially, what Rawls is saying is that none of us deserved to be born intelligent, responsible, hard working, but that we were simply lucky in the natural lottery.  Because of this arbitrary distribution, he believes that we all must compensate for those unfortunate souls that were born unintelligent, lazy, and perhaps even immoral!  I'd admonish Rawls not to attempt applying his insane reasoning to the criminal justice system (Poor, unfortunate murderer).  If Rawls believes that the laziest, dumbest, and most immoral person still deserves a living wage despite not working, he has contradicted himself in that this justifies slavery, forcing individuals to work for other individuals without compensation.  This simply cannot be justice as "fairness".  Nevertheless, I'd recommend it to all free market advocates simply to strengthen their positions.  As a warning however, be prepared for a work that lacks brevity, organization, coherence, and most importantly, reality 
 I bought the book just to read the J.D. Robb story. Unfortunately, Robb should've named the story Distracted in Death. It reads more like a basic outline which has not been fleshed out and provided with emotional depth and intensity. When Robb gives short shrift to the usual description of Roarke and passes him off as "handsome," then let the reader understand that Robb, who is beautifully prolific with figurative language, is not really paying attention to the local color necessary to transform Distracted in Death into a fine story called Haunted in Death.   The story is defined by its absences. Summerset, Mavis, Nadine, McNabb. Though it is true that all of these don't have to people an ...in Death story for it to come alive, these add levels of interest and connectedness that make the series unmatchable. Thus, their absence here is noticeable, especially given the quality of Midnight in Death, in comparison to which Distracted in Death is lacking.  Thus, Distracted  in Death is just going through the motions of being a J.D. Robb story. It does not meet the level of excellence of its predecessors, though it had potential to do exactly that 
 I'm of a mixed mind about this book.  On the one hand, it struck me as sensational rather than scholarly, and written for a younger, more impressionable crowd (probably the same target audience that loves the oh-so-goff "Gothic Grimoire" and so forth).  The basic historical research about vampires is decent, though nothing you couldn't find in any other book about vampire lore. Again, my common gripe about occult nonfic is present (or not)--the lack of in-text citations. The bibliography actually had some surprising inclusions--Franz Bardon's "Initiation in Hermetics" being notable in that respect.  It's when the author gets into modern-day vampires that things get a little weird.  Now, in his defense, he does explain that he did get some rather....err...strange letters, usually by people who were obviously ganking their life-history from fictional sources, and so these weren't quoted. Even the letters that were quoted, though, for the most part struck me as a little ungrounded (is there any vampire who doesn't write with a melodramatic air?)  Now, he printed some of the letters, but gave little feedback on them. I think what he was tying for was a "You decide" kind of thing, but it came off more as "I'm not going to deny them because I ant you to think they're real". Just IMO, of course.  To his credit, he does go into the physical dangers of blood drinking. Most people these days are aware of blood diseases, but I got a little chuckle at the idea of someone ruining their cape after discovering that enough blood will make one vomit.  He's got an odd POV on psychic vampirism, in that all "intentional" psi-vamps are noncorporeal, and any corporeal psi-vamps are "unintentional" (ie, have no idea what they're doing.)  However, also keep in mind that when the book was first written in 1996, the internet wasn't nearly as prevalent, and so the main way to get ahold of those claiming to be vampires was through Fangoria magazine and related venues. There weren't scads of websites created by psychic and sanguine vampires telling it like it is.  Personally, there's a part of me that thinks that Konstantinos wrote everything he did (except for Summoning Spirits, which I very much enjoyed) with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek. I think he hit on a particular untapped target audience, found just the right books to toss at them, and is now laughing all the way to the bank. It's not that he's not serious about what he's doing, but there's an element of the Trickster here as well.  At any rate, "Vampires: The Occult Truth" is an average book with some flaws. There are better books on the topic that have come out since then, but it was what it needed to be when it came out. Maybe a revision will make it more up to date 
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 I tried many times to finish this book because once I buy it and start it, I hate to just walk away from it. BUT, this book did it. I was never really interested in the plot, I thought the writing was very basic, elementary actually, slow, and just plain boring. I tried on more than one occasion to pick it back up, but I never did get into to, making this the only book I've ever started and put back on my shelf with no interest in finishing 
 I have never reviewed a book on Amazon before, but after two weeks of intense reading and note-taking, I have finally finished this book and have strong feelings about it: Although it provides good historical detail about daily life in nineteenth-century England (especially for the poor), I would not recommend it to anyone.  Surely there are many other books with such detail that are not as grueling to read.  My paperback edition has over 1,200 pages containing hundreds of characters, the backgrounds of all the family members of at least six different family lines, and an extremely convoluted plot. I love "getting lost" in a long novel, but about halfway through this one, I felt as if the author were presenting his readers with a test of endurance rather than a story to be enjoyed.  
 This book was a huge dissapointment for me.  I am a stay at home Christian mother of 3.  It is the typical Christian "fluff" that so many publishers and authors are putting out.  I might as well have picked up an arts and crafts holiday book.  I am suprised that focus on the family affiliated themselves with this book 
 I'm astounded at all of the positive reviews for this book.  I bought it primarily because it came highly recommended in a pamphlet by Norman Vincent Peale (a noted Christian pastor) that I ran across entitled "There's Success Magic in You".  It speaks about setting specific goals in life in order to succeed.   With this recommendation, I immediately order the book and couldn't wait to read it.  Red flags started going up immediately upon reading the first few chapters.  There are endless examples about our thoughts having the power to change the actions of people and things. A few examples are:  1) Being able to determine the roll of dice just by concentrating on the appearance of certain numbers. 2) People causing warts on their body to disappear just my thinking about it. 3) A fisherman catching fish when no one else could because he "mentally got down where they were and told them to hook the bait".  This is not the bedrock Christian attribute of faith.  It's something else....magic....mysticism....who knows.  Another annoying thing is the braggadocios manner in which Mr. Bristol repeatedly tells us how successful he became and how much money he managed to accumulate.  As a Christian, I believe in a sovereign God that doesn't necessarily desire that all people be wildly successful in business or be filthy rich.  I can think about quadrupling my salary all day long, but it doesn't mean it's going to happen.  God may have a much more humble will for your life.  Am I saying that prayer and an all-powerful God can't change things in life? Certainly not.  As a previous reviewer noted, this book has been subject to some weird revisionist editing.  References to 747 jumbo jets are a little suspicious considering that the maiden flight was in 1969, some 20-30 years after this book was written.  In summary, "The Magic of Believing" smacks of the fallible "Name It and Claim It" philosophy plus some other mystical beliefs.  Think hard about avoiding it and maybe you will 
 I should have purchased this book from the beginning!  What a savior it has been.  Shipping was quick and the book is in excellent condition 
 The item does not pop open very well. The handle must be turn in one direct to open it, then turned the other direction to open it again. For small children, it is too confusing to operate. If you turn the handle too much, the music stops and the handle turns without opening the toy. In addition, the sound of the music is of poor quality. I would not recommend this toy at all 
 Leave it to MS-press to take two well known Group Policy guys, Dereck and Darren and basically make a book that bores you to death. The whole book seems not to have any real "flow." It just rambles from here to there, putting out information which might be useful, if only there were some order to it. If you're looking for a better guide on Group Policies, Jeremy Moskowitz's book, "Group Policy, Profiles and Intellimirror" is a better bet. It's shorter, more consise and has a unified "flow" which can't be beat.   In short, if you're crazy for MS-press books, go ahead and get this one. Else, save your money and go for the title from Moskowitz instead 
 I'm sorry but I found this book extremely unhelpful.  It was very disjointed.  It wasn't even clear what you were supposed to be writing in the workbook pages.  It just seemed like a stream of consciousness of trite phrases like "everything happens for a reason".  Maybe it's helpful to people who have never thought beyond their nose for their entire life.  I don't know.  I couldn't find anything redeeming in the entire thing.  I ended up just skimming the second half so maybe there was something redeeming in there.   
 The Christian life should be one of honesty with ourselves, with our communities and with the world. All too often it isn't, and Steven James' target is a good one. Sadly this book is both overwritten and repetitive, and remarkably self-involved. Difficult to recommend 
 After listening to Bonamassa on "New Day Yesterday" I was captured by the raw power and abundance of guitar mastery. So - I went and bought the lot of Bonammassas CDs hoping to dig into more imaginative guitar power.  In "So, It's Like That" I found an abundance of sing-along la-la cliches. If you are a fan of Bruce Springsteen you will like the hoarse screaming and loose guitar chords. Allright, a few places the guitar shines but the melodi lines and the broad chrorus style singing drags it down into the pit of trivialities. Sorry!  A single track, "Pain and Sorrow" shines though but boy it was hard to get to track 9. Track 13, "The Hard Way", has a 4 minutes sing-along intro ... or whatever happened as a new track actually starts after 4 minutes and 17 SECONDS OF SILENCE lastning the remaining almost 4 minutes. Maybe it's art, what do I know! 
 A friend had just bought this DVD. I happened to be visiting. He wanted to show me how the special effects had been used in creating the armies. I thought he was just going to show me a few minutes of film, but once it went into the DVD player, it just ran on and on.  I was literally squirming in my seat, this "historical" film is so bad. From Brad Pitt's awkward, unconvincing Achilles, to the painfully anachronistic acting and appearance of the whole film. For some reason, I kept thinking of "Conan the Barbarian".   After about an hour, I literally fled my friend's house, making some excuse. I haven't been back since.  NOT for history buffs 
 It is ironic that you would send this to me.  I can not tell you how excited I was to purchase these slippers.  I had bought everyone in my family UGG slippers for Christmas.  Everyone had cozy slippers but me.....SO instead of paying over $60 I found this pair of Warmbat on amazon.  I researched the brand and thought they may be a good match.  I received the slippers as amazon promised in a timely manner.  The next day the right slipper fell apart the stitching and the bottom of slipper fell off.  I was upset and sewed them, and glued them.  The following week the left slipper fell apart.  I did not want to go thru the process of shipping back the slippers, they were $29.00. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed.  Please forward to WARMBAT 
 I first saw Razorlight on the Live 8 DVD and really liked the two songs they performed. In addition, the band had a pretty cool stage presence. Consequently, I rushed out and bought this CD fully expecting to be mind blown. Unfortunately, I was nearly put to sleep. Folks, in the big picture of the musical universe, there's minimal talent on this CD - anyway you look at it. To make matters worse, Johnny Borrell claims to be as good a songwriter as Bob Dylan. Anyone in the music business dumb enough to make a statement like that has lost all credibility. 
 A tough book to read but it still doesn't explain why muslims are just so intolerant,of other peoples belief's. IS IT BECAUSE FOR ALL THEIR SCREAMING AND BOMB PLANTING THEY ARE REALLY VULNERABLE AND VERY INSECURE.IT SEEMS SO. And as a matter of interest WHY DID MUHAMMED HAVE THE POETRESS ASMA BINT MARWAN KILLED?  AND WHAT DID HE DO WITH HER FIVE CHILDREN.? Why did non-muslims have to pay Jeziya? Find out for yourselves 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 Pierre Bourdieu is a tremendous intellect, and has produced far superior  work to this book.  _Distinction_ is a fascinating book, particularly for  those interested in French society.  Yet its relevance cannot really extend  to America, which has a markedly different system of class.  The French  have deeply entrenched class consciousness, in both a pragmatic sense and a  Marxist sense, whereas 90% of Americans consider themselves "middle  class."   	Bourdieu shows that the French are at pains to  symbolically express their class differences, and he does so with aplomb.   He compiles statistics and data which show ways in which the French produce  their own class position through consumption, education, and taste.   	      But his observations are less applicable to the vast American  "middle class."  Class mobility, education, and stylistic  expression are much more democratically distributed in America.  So while  many French are content with their class position, vocation, and  traditions, most Americans see themselves as "middle class,"  striving for better, and free from tradition.   	    _Distinction_ is  an interesting and accesible book, but those looking for Bourdieu's  contributions to social theory will be better served by some of his other  works 
 Everything is fine. Go back to sleep. Nothing happened here, move along. The government is honest. The Warren Report was totally comprehensive and answered all the questions. Believe. Obey. Go back to sleep. Everything is fine.  I did actually read this book. I will give one thing to the author, he certainly did a fine job finding many of the conflicts and contradictions in the "offical" story. Too bad he He didn't explain any of them. It is a fine research tool in that way.   Unfortunately for Posner his attempts to "debunk" are wholly inadequate and unconvincing. In fact this book is so filled with nonsense and speculation it does more to BOLSTER the case against the "Oswald did it alone" story. If it is true that this was a case of the "lone nut" why would the explantions have to be so over-reaching and internally inconsistent? If it was a straighforward case, the the evidence should be equally straightforward and not so convoluted.  The authors "explanations" are unsupported by fact and at times you can see Posner reaching to the point of "I don't even need to prove it, it should be obvious"  If this is the best effort to prove the Oswald "lone nut" story I no longer have any doubt about the conspiracy theory. If the lone nut story was true there would be supporting evidence that was consistent with the real facts, all the facts and not just the ones cherry picked by the author.  Nice try Mr. Posner 
 I did not like this movie.  I enjoyed the Mack much better.  The price on this video should of been cheaper 
 Okay movie...poor film quality. Later remakes are much better 
 As a dad, I was really looking forward to a book on potty training to help me with my 2-year old. This book is lousy though. Why?  1. Stupid Writing. I got pretty sick of constantly reading all the sappy, "witty" remarks. "Dancing the Potty Mambo"? Give me a break!  2. Stupid Advice. This book keeps telling you to talk to your kid like he/she is an adult. I'm sorry, but a 2-year-old just cannot comprehend a long drawn-out explanation of why you want them or don't want them to do something. How about just saying, "Don't do that!" or "Hey, you want to try this?" That seems to work just fine for me. Why give your kid a doctoral dissertation every time you want them to do something? What's wrong with just telling your kid what to do (nicely), and expecting them to be obedient?   3. Repeating Content. This book kept repeating itself OVER and OVER. Okay, I got it already! I strongly feel that the author wanted to push this book over the 200-page mark when all that needed to be said could probably have been accomplished in about 50 pages (or less).  4. Too Many References. This book constantly refers to other chapters. I once counted 6 different references to other chapters on one page. I am not kidding! Huh? Is potty training really that freakin' complicated? All I want is some general ideas on how to go about it, how to get started, and a few good tips. I don't need all these detailed references. (Nor do I need the phrase "Potty Mambo" repeated to me ad infinitum.)  Here is all I wanted to know: -How do I get started? -What do I do? -How often do I need to try it? -Should I go for pullups or just keep him in diapers for the moment?  Maybe this book got to all of that, but I quit after page 60. I just couldn't take it anymore. After hearing the phrases "Stay Positive" and "Potty Mambo" repeated to me for the umpteenth time, I had to quit. I returned this book and got my money back.  If I were to say anything good about this book, I would say that it has a few good tips, surrounded by about 180 pages of filler.  Potty training still looms ahead. Will I be successful? Probably. But to this book I say, No Thanks 
 I try not to have cookbooks clutter my shelves, but I have heard so much about this from flylady.net that I thought to buy it.  I don't like the recipes very much.  
 This book was the bane of my existence throughout 9th Grade Geometry. Having had a year of a  real  math book this year I am finally able to realize just how stupid the book was. It treats the student like he or she is about two years old, does not provide the information necessary for exam review, and is far too colloquial in general. In addition, it has no answers in the back, just "Hints" in the back of the book that either do nothing at all to help or solve the problem completely without explanation. It also says "SHAME ON YOU" if one looks at the hints without first trying the problem. Personally, I don't enjoy being chastized by a math book, especially one with such a bad approach to Geometry 
 I really thought the author had a terrific idea in writing a send up of our modern world plotted around a sensational killing. All the elements were there, the media, hollywood, gays, etc. However, he missed the opportunity to paint the characters and the plot in broad satirical brush strokes. Often you could almost take these characters seriously. The dialogue, which is probably typical for Dunne, is too clever by half. This book certainly did not make me want to read any more of his writings 
 Not worth the paper it is printed on.  A superficial treatment of analysis, design and implementation of web sites.  After reading 73 pages of content-free material I finally gave up trying to find anything amid the fluff and chucked this one in the trash 
 I gave this only one star as I didn't actually read it. I thought I was ordering books for my grand-daughter, but it turned out to be audio tapes. I paid over $12. for it, but was only refunded $7. Extra fees were added that weren't there when I purchased.  I wrote to Amazon about not wanting a refund, but wanting the actual books, I got NO RESPONSE. I will never order from Amazon again, I am very disappointed with the way this was handled 
 Watson and Crick pilfered the data of Rosalind Franklin (unbeknownst to her) and her data then led them to their ultimate discovery of the double-helix nature of DNA. Instead of acknowledging her with praise, Watson goes on to belittle her and cast her in dark tones without understanding the context in which she was working (ie, a woman working in male-dominated science n the 1950's) -- a classic case of reaction formation. Maybe a brilliant man but with poor insight into human relationships 
 By now we all love Christianity, with its lovable skull-crushing God, deathless Jesus, and the silly angels as well. We especially love the non-fiction accounts such as the flood which arent at all stolen from Eygpitian mythology!!!!!  Well, not everyone likes it! Amy Welborn is just another knee-jerk anti-American, anti-Christian liberal, aint they all, and she hates Christians!!!!!!  Just because the Da Vinci Code PROVES that Jesus existed, married, and had children, one of his long lost sons being the lovable George Bush, she has to criticuze the book!!!!!!   Look if you want ag ood book, you know where to look and thats to books like "PRESIDENT JESUS: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II", "Without Remorse" by the scholarly Tom Clancy, and of course "DA Vinci Code" by Dan Brown, pious God-fearing man that he is 
 I am not impressed with Tiffen filters I got in this set.  The finish of the rings are poor.  Despite of previously poor reputaion, I recently purchased some 67mm Quantaray filter from the local Ritz Camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of Tiffen filters.  I never got Tiffens before, had good experience with Hoyas.  I will probably stay with those from now on.  Now come to think of it, Ritz camera indicated the Quantaray they had were made by Hoya.   The glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the Hoyas and the Quantarays.  Not a good sign. The circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off.  Quite frustrating.  All of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them, not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame, but none of the other filters I got before had this kind of problem right out of the box. The set might be cheap, but it sure is for a good reason 
 Myths are important, but they should not be labeled history.  1.  George Washington was not a great guerilla leader; he commanded conventional forces who fought in lines--just like the redcoats. Washington thought militia and irregulars were undisciplined and unable to face regular troops. 2.  Ronald Reagan did not begin the nuclear "disarming" of the Soviet Union.  Eisenhower and Kennedy tried, but (LBJ?) Nixon and Carter were able to bring the ABM treaty, the SALT treaties and he START treaties to a point where both sides began cutting back their nuclear arsenals.  Reagan did have success with theater wrapons in Europe, but the "big nukes" that could end civilization were already being cut back.  This is an interesting book about Reagan and Peggy Noonan, but some of the history cited is WRONG 
 poor quality, the cover leaks, I had to return it back, DO NOT BUY 
 As a middle school 6th grade teacher, I experience the gamut of behavoir issues from too much chatting, to rudeness to the occasional pushing/fighting.  I found myself reverting to what this book suggests you don't do (but most teachers do) and that is to constantly say "Don't" and "because I said so".  While I control out of punishment and consequences, I was not feeling I was controlling out of respect.  I was searching for a book that could help me, and came across this one.  I liked the simple concepts. I liked the actual examples used of typical classroom issues.  This book made me "think" about how I am coming across to my kids now and how I SHOULD come across.  The only part of the book that left me wondering was 'how do teachers have time to implement this'.  I wish the author could have addressed that issue more 
 I would avoid these discs.  I have been using these discs for some time doing backups.  Recently, I've had a few problems and decided to look at these further.  I noticed another review that said that the discs are made by multiple companies under the Memorex brand as are others like TDK, etc..  I used to DVD info and noticed that my most recent purchase is made by CMC and I'm having problems with some of the discs including burn errors. One disk has strange ring in the die.   I have the NEC 1300a burner.  I also having some trouble playing backups on the same drive on my computer. Less trouble playing on my Sony DVD player. Just based on this (not a clear indication of what you're getting when you purchase), I would go with something else. These discs are not cheap enough for this reason. 
      I agree with some of the less favorable reviews.  Many of the people in the book came from big named schools and were very well off financially before thinking about a life change.  Some of the stories left you wondering what happened.  And so many of the stories were just not long enough to really provide useful insight into anyone's life.  It was like Po had a stopwatch set for 30 minutes and told each person he interviewed to tell them a little about themselves and their career path.      I'm a recent graduate from a non ivy league school.  After majoring in Business, I've been struggling to just simply get experience in the areas of business I like (or any area at this point).  I thought this book would provide stories to which I could relate, but for the most part there were none.  I was hoping for some inspirational stories on what steps I could take to find the right job that would lead to the right opportunities that would make me happy and financially secure.  Instead, many of the people would make tons of money and then simplify their lives by baking cakes or opening a catfish farm which is fine when you're already financially secure.  That also was annoying.  It always seemed like people in the book had to make less money to be happier.  I understand that makes sense in some cases, but the book made it seem like it was the only way.  Even Po kept talking about how he could have made 300 grand a year, but decided against it.  Isn't it possible your calling could lead you to more money?  I am not selfish, money is not everything to me, but I do understand that you do in fact need it.      I gave this book 2 stars, because there was one quote that I did like and made sense to me.  "The true search is what you believe in."  As opposed to only looking at what you're good at.  I think the book needed much more inspirational insight like this.  There were a few other parts of the book that provoked some deep thought, but unfortunately it was more miss then hit.  I wish I could give it 2 1/2 stars, because that would better demonstrate just how down the middle, okay, and simply average the book was.  Don't buy this book expecting it to be an eye opener.      Lets face it, the question "What should I do with my life?" can never be truely anwsered.  It's like pondering about god or the universe.  I just wanted it to make me think "oh wow, that's an interesting way to think about it or approach that question."  Instead, I was almost always left thinking "Um okay, so did I miss something there?" 
 First part of the book, pretty much tell you to skip some material while you are reading, because the fewer words you read, the less time you will spend, the faster you will be. THIS IS TOALLY nonsense. the author even told u to read one line and skip the next, and read the third line. THIS IS ridiculous. Second part told you to use finger, index card, pen....etc to help reading.....that is kinda useless. The third part teachs you how to read magazine, textbook, newspaper...etc. Still the author told you just read the one you are interesting in (even a grade 6 will know that).  SO DON"T BUY IT. I feel so bad wasting my time reading it... 
 This is supposed to be a black comedy.  In fact, it is an ineptly directed, unfunny, obscene mess.  It features filthy language, the required men's bathroom scene, rape, racism, hatred of America, and ridicule of the mentally ill.  Attention all Altzheimer's patients, Reiner thinks you're hilarious.  Watch Harold and Maude or, even better, Little Murders if you want to see black comedy.  This bomb is best forgotten.  I'm not selling my DVD copy, I'm throwing it away 
 The copy I have is full of quotes praising the novel. After reading and enjoying Dog Soldiers and Outerbridge Reach, I thought I was in for a treat.  What a boring novel! Maybe it would have made a great short story, but it goes on far too long to keep the reader interested. Perhaps it was "shocking" or "insightful" in its day, but now it very common place. There is one well written scene early in the book where the actress's husband encounters a weird Hollywood threesome; but the scene ends and the story goes no where 
 The author believes that France's economy, and socialism generally, is admirable. This, against all evidence to the contrary. Really, how much more of this sort of wishful thinking masquerading as economic analysis are we expected to take? Haven't we had enough demonstration of the falsity of these ideas? As socialist economies drag their shuddering bulks to standstills while the people riot (and rot), we are expected to heed calls to admire, and replicate, their failures. Amazing. Read Hayek. Von Mises. Sowell. Friedman. This guy, here, should never have been published 
 When I first read this book, I loved it.  That was a long time ago, and I am older and wiser now. Now I realize that it is extremely important to read both sides of an issue before coming to a conclusion. Hislop, sadly, uses the power of selective information: You will only find part of the story in this book. I strongly recommend that you read Ralph Woodrow's "The Babylon Connection?" before coming to any conclusions based on this book.  We Christians are supposed to be as "wise as serpants"-- do your historical homework before buying into Hislop's ideas 
 This book provides countless examples of people and businesses damaged or threatened by governmental excess, corruption and abuse of power.  The examples are often egregious and frightening.  Some are familiar, like the kinds of things seen on 60 Minutes.  Others are eye-opening.  There is enough documentation and familiarity to trust the book's general thrust.  Some of the rhetorical tactics used in the book are questionable.  For example, the author will write a paragraph dealing with excessive govermental laws and regulations, and the paragraph will include not just laws that are on the books, but bills that have been considered and rejected.  I find this tactic unnecessarily inflammatory, given the amount of actual material that the author claims to exist.  Why talk about unfair and coercive laws that don't even exist if there are so many that already do?  The book does not provide balance.  The central idea can be found in the following quote:    "The larger government becomes, the more coercive it will be -- almost regardless of the intentions of those who advocate a larger government."  This statement may be true, and numerous examples from the book certainly bolster it.  But there are other sides to the argument as well.  Since the author doesn't present them, he hasn't refuted them.  And since he hasn't refuted them, has he really proven his case?  Bovard never presents the other side --that government can actually help and protect people.  It's easy to argue against abusive forfeiture laws and tyrannical law enforcement agencies -- they leave plenty of innocent victims in their wake.  But if you're such a believer in non-government, why not talk about Social Security, Medicare or popular government programs that have helped and continue to help many people?  The book sets up easy targets and knocks them down, but it shies away from the hard questions.  The book does not provide analysis of the complex world we live in.  It presents "power" as a kind of seesaw that totters up or down.  On one side sits the government, and on the other, "the people".  Any loss of weight or power on one side creates a corresponding gain on the other.  Reality is much more complex.  For example, take the legal battle between the US Government and Microsoft.  The Government exercised its power against Microsoft through investigations and lawsuits, thus weakening the company and preventing it from conducting business as it chose.    According to Bovard, this would constitute a loss of liberty from "the people" to "the Government."  But since Microsoft was arguably excercising its market power to enrich itself at the expense of "the people" (less choice, less innovation, higher prices), the net loss of power from Microsoft to the Government was arguably a gain for "the people".  As another example, take the decision by the FCC to "deregulate" media ownership, thus allowing concentrated ownership of media outlets.  According to polls, public opinion, public comment and public hearings, "the people" did not want media ownership deregulated.  The Government's  divestment of power to regulate in this area will result in tremendous concentration of media ownership in a few private hands, and arguably, corresponding losses of choice, innovation, accountability and diversity in media.  All in all, a net loss for "the people."  The book simply does not ever even consider the protection for "the people" that comes from government laws, regulations and enforcement.  Because the book lacks any in-depth analysis of the role of government in society, it ultimately lacks intellectual legitimacy.  If all governmental power is power removed from the people, and if this is necessarily "coercive", and if bigger government is necessarily worse and more coercive, then the logical extension of this argument, taken to Bovard's rational conclusion, is that we should have no government at all.  None.  Period.  End of sentence.  Why give coercive power over yourself to another?  Some communities in some parts of the world work this way.  If someone hurts you, steals from you, kills your friend or relative, it is your responsibilty to remedy the situation.  There is no rule of law as we know it.  But Bovard never advocates this result.  He clearly likes and wants some amount of government.  He wants a police force to punish murderers and other criminals, and he wants an army to defend his country.  He wants intellectual property laws that enable him to collect royalties on his books.  He wants government systems to adjudicate those laws, and he wants government remedies to punish people who might steal from him.  He wants a tax system coercive enough to ensure that he gets all of these things at public expense.  In other words, he wants the amount of government that he wants.  Okay, but so does everyone else, from George W. Bush to Ted Kennedy.  What makes Bovard's vision of the "right" amount of Government any more valid then yours, mine or Timothy McVeigh's?  Bovard launches one anti-government broadside after another, but he never considers the types of difficult questions necessary for an honset debate.  The book also lacks historical perspective.  Okay, there is some historical information about where zoning laws came from, and there's a little social commentary about forfeiture laws and environmental protection regulations.  But precious little.  For the most part, onerous, nonsensical and tyrannical laws are treated as if they dropped from the sky and appeared wholly formed in our nation's legal and political system.  But as every 6th grader knows, that's not where laws come from.  They come from legislators and other government officals who are often enough responding to the will of "the people".  F0r every ridiculous or tyrannical law that Bovard mentions, there was some set of democratically-elected legislators who supported and passed it and some majority of citizens who elected them.  In other words, at some point, we, the people, have to stop blaming "government" for creating unwanted laws, and we have to take some responsibility for how and why we are allowing and supporting it.  Bovard doesn't see any individual responsibilty on the part of the people.  He writes as if "government" were an occupying force that dropped out of the sky one day and simply took over.  Given that the book lacks honest debate and critical analysis, it also lacks solutions.  Bovard presents a lot of evidence that we have too much government in our lives.  But he never articulates what to do about it.  Because there is no analysis, there is no criteria on which to decide which laws are good, which are bad, and why.  The book may be a "wake up call", but if you wake up and accomplish nothing, is that any more productive than remaining asleep 
 I found this book to be very biased and offensive.  I agree with one of the other reviewers, her section on hyperemesis is downright wrong and condescending.  As long as you have a healthy pregnancy and want a natural childbirth, you might like this book.  For the rest of the world that lives in reality, you might find her narrow-minded approach offensive 
 I bought the mission file cart to go with a mission side table, bookshelf, and coffee table. It does not match the other three in look or in build quality. It's even a different color. It was harder to assemble than the other pieces, especially the file drawer. For a printer table, I would recommend the sturdier side table instead 
 Having been a fan of Antonia Fraser for many years, I highly anticipated her biography of Queen Marie-Antoinette, but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual. She depicts Marie-Antoinette's mother Empress Maria Theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to France at age 14 to get married, but arranged marriages were the norm; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary. What startled me most is that Fraser not only insists on Antoinette having an affair with Count Axel von Fersen, of which there is little concrete evidence, but goes onto maintain that Axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant. It seems to me that Marie-Antoinette loved children so much; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister Caroline went on to have eleven children or more. She was also a devout Catholic and using such devices were unthinkable, unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes. In this case Fraser is applying the morals of some British aristocratic ladies to a queen of France. If Marie-Antoinette had been caught in adultery, it would have been considered treason; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her. With all of her enemies at Court, that was not a risk she would have taken, if she had been so inclined. On a smaller scale, Fraser makes ridiculous assertions about Marie-Antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that I have seen of her, her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age; I have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it. Not that that is a big deal; but it makes me wonder where Lady Fraser's life ends and where Marie-Antoinette's life begins. I found it offensive that at the end Fraser interprets Marie-Antoinette's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy, when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king. Especially, since Marie-Antoinette's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and Napoleon crowning himslf emperor. Sadly, there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the English language. One can only hope that the works of Bertieres, Chalon, and Delorme will soon be translated and published in English. Fraser's book does have some interesting details (aside from those which flow from her imagination) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than Lever's travesty 
 This book is the silliest pile of nonsense I have ever run across.  If you've got nothing better to do with your time than read one of the Penn Dutch Inn books then you've got more time than good sense 
 My father, my friend mandy and i watched this movie last night. we were all very disappointed. we thought the movie wasn't realistic. we watched the news and saw all the firefighters and police officers running into the buildings trying to help the people. in this "movie" we saw them leisurely walking around, even stopping to have nice conversations with each other about what they thought was happening. we were really disappointed with the search scene.  it made the men and women of our country look like quitters because it was getting dark. we were under the impression that they search through the night. at least that's what we saw on the news. guess we were wrong. all together i would have to say i'm glad i borrowed this movie from a friend instead of wasting my money buying or renting it 
 I was totally disappointed in this DVD.  When I saw them advertise it on the show I was so excited.  Went out the next day to buy it and watch it.  I thought this is going to be fun but the sound quality was horrible and the steps were to hard to follow.  They should show you very slowly and then speed it up as you go along like they do in my belly dancing and crunch videos.  I hope the next DVD is better quality and worth my money 
 adding more magical abilities to fighters... if u thought clerics were powerful try tanks with spell like abilitie 
 Look, you don't know who "Depp Throat" is, I don't know who he/she is and Garment dosen't know either. Only Woodward, Bernstien, Ben Bradlee and "Deep Throat" him/herself does. No point in devoting hours to pondering a question that won't be answerd untill "DP" dies. This book is a waste of paper.  UPDATE: Well, we all know who it was now, so I guess this book has become rather pointless. DP didn't die, but he finally "came out" so to speak. Like I said before, we all just had to wait 
 I wanted to read this book as lighthearted summer fun.  Instead, I found a rather dreary tale of some seriously mixed up people.  Most infuriating was the character of Tony, possibly the most arrogant, pompous, self-righteous ass who has ever graced modern literature.  And the author condones him and his behavior!  He's right, don't you see?  He's a macho guy, the omni present voice of reason and knowing what's right for everyone.  The other infuriating part of this novel is the author's treatment of Faye, the heroine.  Because she's "fiesty, independent and outspoken", she is repeatedly referred to as "difficult to HANDLE" and "a real handful".  Excuse me, but is Ms. Moore saying that women need to be "handled"?  Apparently so, since we're told that Faye has really "met her match" in this Tony loser.  I think that a man with those same characteristics would be praised as a real go-getter, aggressive and accomplished.  Why the author has strong-willed Faye succumb to Tony's blackmail and bullying is WAY beyond me.  And the way the novel ended?  COME ON!  She has made the smart, strong willed man the hero (though she tries to discuss his "faults" to make things appear even), and the woman very introspective and sorry for the way she is... and trying ever so hard to change.  If any man tried to bully and blackmail any smart woman into ruining her own wedding day, I'm pretty sure she'd tell him to shove it far, far up where the sun don't shine - and I can't believe that Faye didn't. A novel for the 21st century?  I don't think so.  If you love chick-lit, read the Shopaholic books or the Nanny Diaries; at least they're well written and FUNNY 
 Despite the fact that the country (not just the right, as in Reagan's case) practically beatified Roosevelt at the time of his death, and also despite the virtually unanimous opinion among historians that he was one on of the three truly great leaders this country has ever had, authors like Flynn just cannot seem to let it go. The anti-FDR/New Deal/Yalta smear brigade, fueled from the beginning by the same 'big money' that ironically caused the Depression in the first place, marches on to its own drummer, preaching to its own choir.   If a man is measured by who his enemies were, then the legacy of FDR, only perhaps second to Lincoln, may rest undisputed 
 At less than a dollar per sparkly Frisbee, this is the best price I can find for Frisbees. They don't fly very well and they break relatively easily, but this is the best value I can find for 100 Frisbees in one place.  A lot of people are disappointed because they expect to be able to use these discs as writable CD media. The problem with that is, they don't work very well for that either. I, too, tested this for myself.  Using Nero Burning ROM, I tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs -=AT 4X=-, just like you're supposed to. IT WORKED! It burned fine. Then it took 5 minutes to open a simple HTML document on the burned disc. Subsequent trials run with the "Verify Written Data" checkbox checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning. It's like writing with a white crayon, except this is white paper. This persisted on several OTHER computers with different CD burner drives and even different software.  I finally realized what great Frisbees these things are. Cheer up people: THEY ARE GREAT FUN! So grab your spindle, go outside, and start chucking these things at your neighbor's annoying dog.  PS. I need to sue Memorex for selling this junk. These disc are just a form of abuse 
 [Wince.] Noticing that Reilly had been an international bestseller, I bought these audio CDs for a road trip and subsequently found myself embarrassed as I listened to a book that seemed to borrow all its plotlines from G.I. Joe cartoons. Listening to the audio version, I was amazed at Reilly's nerve in magically saving his hero time and again. Reilly even pummels the reader with the same language in the sentences preceding the countless near misses. The hero is about to be squashed, when just at the last second -- his friend uses a magnet to suck him back out of the way. The hero disappears off the cliff, when just before he hits the ground -- he manages to activate a parachute. The hero is about to be decapitated, when just at the last moment -- his friend comes back from the dead to shoot the brains out of his foe.     While Reilly no doubt did research to write this book, the flatness of his characters uncovers him as a grownup child still obsessed with battle action cartoons, good vs. evil comic books, action figures, and wham! pow! action scenes, but who never learned to relate emotionally on an adult level. The author himself writes in a book interview that it devastated him to have to cut off the life of his hero's girlfriend, an undeveloped character that's about as flat as my niece's stick figure drawings. As I listened to him talk about it, I felt sorry -- not for his character but for myself. After all, if he had wanted the reader to care, even a little, he could have taken the time to create just one conversation between the hero and his girlfriend 
 This was a comprehensive collection of statistics and War Department strategy notes but it had no life. It gave no feel for the soldier, sailor or marine on the ground.  It was all acronyms and big picture strategy. If you are looking for something less academic and more readable try a different account of the battle. Since this was one of the most gruelling and bloody encounters of the war, the participants should get more ink. Here, the brass get all the attention 
 I don't own this book nor have I read it, but if that first sentence is any indication of the quality of writing, I won't ever.  It is not a sentence.  One would think you would save your non-sentences for someplace else in a book, not start off with one, giving your readers the impression that you are all hat and no cattle before you even make your points 
 Nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst, and how dare him to diss KRS-one, he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on Number 1, he just added to why he sucks. Lets face it, all his songs are basically dumb and and really don,t have much texture involved. And how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable. If you buy this album, you throw away good money. Unless you like bubblegum rap. This is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool, but lets face it ,its played out 
 I live in the ghetto(because the darkest blacks live there), am insecure about my nappy hair, will not climb the corporate ladder as swiftly as my light skinned peers, when choosing a mate I will desire a light skinned husband so that I can dip into a lighter gene pool, and finally, if I had to adopt a child I would REQUEST a light skinned one quicker than a dark one.  Slave talk, all of it!  I read this book (most of it) with a completely open mind and hoping for a well researched and fair study of black america's color complex. I ended up throwing this book across the room in frustration. This book perpetuates the myth more than black america. As a dark skinned female I felt horrible reading this, mothers don't let your babies read this, it can be SERIOUSLY detremental to ones development. In all honesty I can say with much authority (after all I have been black all of my life) that the very vast majority of black people do NOT think like this. I find it very hard to believe that it's no more than a coincidence that the authors are the two who benefit the most from the "color complex", a light skinned female and a dark male (because according to this book light skinned men lack the all important street credibility and dark skinned women are bitter and unattractive).  This is a disgraceful portrayal of what could have been a pivotal cultural study. Shame on them for perpetuating the myth 
 This book was rather fun to read but I am not convinced that the authors have as deep an understanding of the phenomena they are writing about as they would like the readers to believe.  The book reads like a narrative, full of assertions that are not backed by rigorous analysis of hard evidence.  The authors do not critically explore causal relationships, nor do they talk about research that has done so.  They present only one particular perspective on the unfolding of events, and they do not defend this perspective against potential criticism.  My experience with economics has always reinforced the idea that causality can be difficult to establish, and can often operate in unexpected ways.  An economist must proceed skeptically, being careful to explore alternative explanations and being prepared to defend assertions with theory and data.  The authors do not seem to share this view, taking instead a more naive approach.  Maybe I was expecting too much; after all this book is meant to be accessible to non-economists.  However, making a book more accessible does not necessitate a lack of rigour or the absence of critical thought; the authors could have removed some of the redundancy in the book (their writing is far from concise!) and replaced it with explorations of alternative perspectives.  The book would be greatly enriched by adding more discussion of research that supports (or opposes) their views 
 I was drawn to this book by the promise of experiencing or gaining familiarity with a new part of Paris, a city I have visited often.  The book fell far short of that.  It left me disappointed and longing for what I had missed.  It was difficult to connect with or enter into the story primarily  because the author failed to portray a personal intimacy with the subject. As an example, she tells us that moving within Paris was a bigger event than imagined but the description lacked emotional depth. Where were her feelings, little experiences, failings, successes, reactions. Overall, the author proved she has knowledge but does not know how to share it.   
 Unlike the first three seasons, which were nothing short of brilliant, this season seems to have lost the Wodehouse touch. The absolute low point was a madcap chase up the Empire State Building; both Bertie and Jeeves were completely out of character. I got through the set just once and re-sold it almost immediately. I highly recommend the first three sets, but if you're a Wodehouse purist, pass on this fiasco 
 Okay, this story throws in a bunch of Goddess/feminist/mother-rite stuff, but the main female character is nothing more than a stupid girl. To sum up the entire series, she does not care about the land she is ruler of at all. She abandons the land practically and I really can't blame some of the characters for trying to overthrow her. The only way Miles can make any of her female characters seem powerful is to make the men weakminded and half retarded. Tristan is a pansy who happens to be good with a sword. And while Tristan and Isolde is supposed to be set in the dark ages, Miles makes Isolde disgustingly wealthy as far as jewels go. She also makes all Christians look like vindictive zealots. Not to mention that although she is so obsessed with the mother rite and plus she is a princess/queen, she will not stand up to her husband. Don't waste your money on this book about a selfish, stupid young woman who is in love with an equally stupid guy 
 this book sucks, it taught me nothing, because of this boook i faild algebra.    DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
 The first part of this 1997 edition covers material that is an "old hat". The rest of the topics are unnecessary, badly explained, too superficial, or unfocused. Don't waste your money, and your time 
 It `s absolute boring watching these guys to cool of from the summer heat. It `s not worth watching some guy showering or another putting ice-cr?me on his body - sorry that `s not exiting or clever!!! There `s no interesting or hot action or anything else! Only some naked guys! Don `t buy it, you will waste your money. If you really want to see hot action, buy a DVD from falcon, but not this one! Greeting from germany 
 Beware of the Everyman's Library edition of this book (green hardcover, ribbon marker, isbn # 0-679-40564-X). Book V dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted. According to the introduction, this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low. I wish I had known this BEFORE I ordered the book since now I have to buy a different edition in order to read Book V. What a ripoff 
 I've owned and used this machine for over a year.  Sometimes the coffee is really good but sometimes it comes out really weak.  If you don't set the carafe in just right, the pause-and-serve feature stops the coffee from flowing into the carafe and it overflows the filter instead.  The result is coffee all over the counter, floor, etc.  It has ruined my wood floor!!!  I am always careful when I put the carafe in, but it happened anyway.  Last night I brewed a pot of coffee and it came out tasting terrible.  I'm done with this coffee maker, buying a new one today..maybe the braun 
 Good writers should be able to make their work suitable for all ages (especially younger readers) without making their prose sound overly simplistic or juvenile. This should be especially easy for books on baseball, since there's "a lot of little boy" in both the writers and readers - it should come naturally. Perfect, unfortunately, is just plain bad. How these writers can take some of the most dramatic stories of baseball and make them uninteresting and virtually unreadable leaves me (nearly) speechless. Even Ken Burns' Baseball series' mention of some of the perfect games in far less space is far more compelling. In addition, I found that there was really very little information - even with the recent games - that isn't already readily available in the briefest of articles found elsewhere. At most a few known quotes and dugout/clubhouse anecdotes can be found for each game, amid a wash of overly simplistic and juvenile text. Book should have been titled "See Spot Pitch". Can't recommend it, sadly 
 I surely wouldn't reccomend buying this dinosaur. Bought it online and it never did work. Panasonic "support" was as bad as it's DVD. One support specialist told me to unplug it and then plug it in again. Another was reading from a list of "What to do if the caller says this." The repair shop gave me the idea that Panasonic no longer makes this product. They couldn't find a replacement part so they are replacing my DVD. In all I've waited over a month and a half to watch my $299 DVD player and I still haven't got a new one from the repair shop. If your smart don't purchase one of these antiques 
 I tried to read this, but found the crudity (lust) and cussing a little too much, especially for a young adult novel.  I'm surprised it's so popular, really... the characters weren't even likeable.    If the story would have been good enough I would have read it anyway, but it wasn't THAT good 
 I didn't feel that this was his best work.  I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes.  Too much detail on mundane stuff.  Suspense picked up on Tape 6, but wasn't the same type of suspense like "PREY".  Enjoyed it, but would've liked more suspense 
 You get your money's worth here--there are a ton of CDs in this audio book. Unfortunately, I found Bryson's prose (which I enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as I have done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud. To me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and sometimes there is a sort of "moist" sound when he pronounces words. Hard to describe until you hear the CD, but trust me on this one. I think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book, and not the CD. I would stick with the written word on this one.  
 Great book for the very very beginner, but hardly an insider's guide.  An insider's guide would have talked about slippage/requoting, stop hunting, price shading, and all the dark stuff that really goes on behind the curtain of these retail forex companies.  You want to trade forex? First, contact the NFA and CTFC and demand this new and exciting industry to be regulated 
 Carter's scholarship is superb but his writing dense. Though he correctly gauges Wallace's political import, as did other biographers before him, he wrongly equates Wallace's racism with his other political stances. Millions  supported Wallace because he articulated their concerns over issues like  crime, high taxes, and federal intrusion that other politicians of the time  were ignoring 
 Sandra Brown is my favorite suspense/romance writer.  I always look forward to reading her new releases and this book was no exception.  However, I was very disappointed with Ricochet.  Normally, her books have so many twists and turns that you can't figure out "who did it" until the very end, which keeps you up all night wanting to read.  This book was different.  I kept thinking it would get better but it never did.  I highly recommend Chill Factor or White Hot instead of Ricochet 
 His fragmentary thoughts are difficult to follow. There is some wisdom here and there, but not worth the headache you'll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head. Here is an example: "If you say your own name to yourself at such a moment, it will seem utterly alien. You will then understand the sacrament of baptism." Huh?  At first, I thought his writing may just be over my head, but after re-reading most of it, I realized it was just bad. It's like the whole book was written when he was high or something. Some very good ideas, but most can be found in other, better written books. 
 Given the breathless cover blurbs by Mark Goodacre and Larry Hurtado, one might expect that Stephen Carlson had uncovered some previously unknown and utterly spectacular new manuscript evidence or made a similarly startling scholarly breakthrough on the subject of the Secret Gospel of Mark. Instead, Gospel Hoax is a tendentious, lawyerly daisy chain of micro-arguments that forcibly reminded me of Kierkegaard's complaint about being trampled by geese. Carlson comes to the question of authenticity already convinced that Secret Mark has been falsified and announces in his preface, "Now that I knew what to look for and where to look for it, all I had to do was find it." (xviii) If there is anything axiomatic in New Testament studies, it is that a priori conclusions are always confirmed by "evidence" and Carlson's hoax has become the most recent Exhibit A of this sad fact.  Much of Carlson's evidence for forgery revolves upon the flimsy spindle of handwriting analysis. Mr. Carlson, to the best of my knowledge, has no particular training in paleography or document verification, has never published in this field, nor has his work been vetted by disinterested experts. The inadequacy of this amateur exercise has been thoroughly revealed by Scott Brown in "Factualizing the Folklore: Stephen Carlson's Case Against Morton Smith" in the Harvard Theological Review (99:291, ff).  A close reading of the supposed evidence for forgery shows that Carlson actually negates much of his own argument. The features of supposed forgery cited by Carlson "can be attributed to the writer's age, fatigue, stress level, or other causes for a loss of fine motor control." (26) A further objection which readily comes to mind is the fact that the text in question was copied in a small cursive hand into the end pages of a small book. Did the copyist have the luxury of placing the book on a steady surface, or did he hold it in his lap? Questions of this kind could be multiplied, but there is obviously no way to answer them. Indeed, the apparent strength of Carlson's arguments disappears once it is pointed out that they are, in the final analysis, speculative and can therefore never be either proven or disconfirmed.   A second major claim of this very minor book is that the overweening Smith planted references to himself within the Clement letter to tweak the noses of his fellow academics. Only a very clever person indeed would be able to identify these hidden signatures and Carlson imagines himself to be that very person, a delusion which may account for the smirking, self-congratulatory tone of his writing. The silliness of this project culminates in the identification of a passing mention of salt --"even the salt loses its flavor"-- as a reference to Morton Smith (Morton Smith = Morton Salt). A critique of this bizarre line of argumentation has been written by Kyle Smith (no relation to Morton) of Duke University, "Mixed with Inventions: Salt and Metaphor in Secret Mark" (available online on Wieland Willker's New Testament homepage). Kyle Smith concludes, "...by my reckoning, Carlson is down 0-1."  Naturally Carlson does not fail to raise the non-issue of Smith's sexuality. In point of fact one must wonder if this is part of the reason the book was released by Baylor University Press, the publishing arm of the notoriously homophobic Baylor University which has the dubious distinction of being the world's largest, and no doubt grandest, Baptist school. I supply this bit of information lest the unsuspecting reader assume that Baylor represents a source of reasoned inquiry. The intellectual universe of Baylor University is in fact one of the outer planets of the Bible Belt and closely reflects denominational prejudice and hostility to contrary opinion. On this question the interested reader is referred to Scott Brown's refutation of The Hoax, "The Question of Motive in the Case against Morton Smith," in the Journal of Biblical Literature (125:351,ff)   It is quite ironic that Carlson castigates Smith for cluttering the presentation of his evidence with "historically worthless testimonia" (88) which Carlson has decreed to have no relevance to the authenticity of Secret Mark, but uses up 23 pages (by my count) of his slender volume to expatiate on such subjects as faked artifacts, Piltdown Man, Pfaff's forgery of Irenaeus, the Coleman-Norton agraphon, and how CBS supposedly got it all wrong about George Bush's exit strategy from Vietnam. In Stephen Carlson's parallel universe these wildly disparate subjects apparently have some material bearing on the letter of Clement.  There is little point in cataloging each and every claim made in Gospel Hoax, claims which are already being examined and dismantled on a regular basis. In fact, I predict that Carlson's hoax will catalyze a more sober and thorough examination of the evidence and will in fact result in the publication of additional opinion favoring the authenticity of Secret Mark. Contrary to Carlson's intent, this book has not buried the longer gospel of Mark, but instead helped to raise the whole matter once again. Having served this purpose, the book will be retired to the science fiction section of Christian bookstores.  For those readers in search of intelligent discussions of Secret Mark and the ways in which it may illuminate our understanding of Jesus' life and career, the following are recommended (with some reservations): Crossan's Four Other Gospels: Shadows on the Contours of Canon, Meyer's Secret Gospels: Essays on Thomas and the Secret Gospel of Mark, Brown's Mark's Other Gospel, and my own Jesus the Sorcerer: Exorcist and Prophet of the Apocalypse. Dr. Wieland Willker's home page has an excellent section on the Secret Gospel of Mark with links to a number of important and informative articles.  On cross examination Carlson's Hoax fails in each and every particular argument. In short, it is a painful book to read, but at least the pain is over quickly.  Robert Conne 
 This collection of essays and excerpts from other works purports to present issues of congregational conflict in a systematic manner.  And while I found a great deal of pertinent information and suggestions regarding the handling of congregational conflict I struggled with a lack of coherence in this compilation.  That is, the essays and excerpts did not flow as a meaningfully presented linear argument.  Rather, the work read like an often disparate collections of fragmentary arguments.  In fact, this lack of whole, this lack of cohesion, was so distracting that I wondered if this compilation was little more than a marketing ploy to offer another work that would provide income for the publisher.  I am hopeful that this is not the case.  Rather, I trust that this compilation is nothing less than an attempt to provide a variety of perspectives on dealing with congregational conflict that would prompt the reader to further seek information from those authors with whom the reader resonated.  I do not recommend this work as a good resource for dealing with congregational conflict.  Instead, I do recommend it as a sort of "card catalog" that one might browse through so as to discover other works and resources that would be beneficial for dealing with congregational conflict. 
 While this book may be helpful to children who are seen as "special" or "crippled," I would never recommend it, because of the title,  which is bad as "The Nig**er Lamb" would be. Get it?  I'm an advocate for people with disabilities, the preferred term, and can assure you that a book called "crippled" and terms like "special" will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause  children to be perceived even more as "special" instead of different but equal 
 If one wants to parent with lofty idealism that has limited practical applications then this is the book for you. The authors have presented a philosophy of "joyful" parenting with an effort for parents and children to find "flow" and make play and "optimal learning" experience. In doing so, the "real" world is seen as so out of reach of any nurturing loving parent, that is has to be denounced so that you can create the dream world of your own. As I agree that "culture" has to be looked upon with a critical eye, not every negative aspect of it should be shielded from children nor dismissed is such sweeping general terms. Not every competitive children's sport out there is run by a despotic coachs with overly demanding parents. The way the authors present their theory makes it seem that this is so. Obviously this does exist, but to categorize every one in that group is not only bad editorship, but a highly susceptible argument;without specifics what are we going to discuss: subject or principle?  And random quotes from Pearce's previous books, highlighting every page so that it is jam packed with excessive verbage is not only disconcerting but an equally distressing part to their presentation of ideas. It would have been better to have shorter versions of Pearce's quotes, not the chronically long passages that sometimes do not even go with the main text of the page. And statements from Pearce, such as "... Up to the post World War II period, no suicide has ever been recorded under age fourteen.." leaves one wondering. Now where is Pearce talking about, The United States? Europe? No child during the Depression in our country and those under the rise of Nazism every committed suicide? This hits to the problem with the book: blanket statements that may be true, but may not. As long as it feeds to their argument and is wrapped with flowering prose, then it is acceptible. But what is left out is content.  What would have been better if they utilized this theory into practical results; following families who have to live in the "real" world because mortages and taxes have to be paid, and record the results. How "play" can be implemented in your child's world with "real" examples. Then showcase how a family is succeeding or failing in their endeavors.  There are better books out there that showcase learning, children and the role of parents. Maria Montessori, Charlotte Mason, Erik Erikson, Howard Gardner, David Elkind, John Taylor Gatto, seem better suited to discuss the practical realm of children's learning then the pedantical philosophizing that I found here.    
 I had heard that Chocoleans were effective, but I was very disappointed. They taste good, but didn't satisfy my hunger or my sweet tooth. About the same as eating a piece of dark chocolate. I wound up gaining weight while using these 
 This book makes some pretty false assumptions based on hyped, unscientific claims. Go to the reviews for "The Whole Soy Story," by Kaayla T. Daniel, and you will get previews of a book that alarmingly shows soy products to be a danger to health.  Evidence is mounting that soy is an anti-nutrient, that in fact it is an extremely unhealthy substance.  The way soy is manufactured, processed, and chemically altered, it has no remaining "food" value to speak of.

 The book reads like a series of very shallow popular magazine articles. I felt like I was wasting my time, and just skimmed most of it after the first few chapeters 
 "Tribulation Force" is not as good as the first book in the "Left Behind" series.  The authors seem to be doing so much maneuvering to get their characters into the right crucial positions around the Antichrist, that there's almost no time left for the story.   I was amused by the authors' description of the Two Witnesses and their miraculous protection by God.  If God could do that sort of miracle, why hasn't he been doing it all along?  A few incidents of such miraculous protection of missionaries would have sufficed to convert millions in countries like China and Japan, not to mention unbelievers in the U.S. Instead, missionaries sent to non-Christian nations have routinely been killed or expelled.  Why would God permit such a thing?  Does He want people to go to Hell?  Rabbi Ben-Judah's speech in "Tribulation Force" about how he's changed his mind and decided that Christ is in fact the Messiah struck me as absurd.  The Bible prophecy that "a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son" does not even appear in the original Hebrew of the Old Testament. The Hebrew word translated as "virgin" would be more correctly translated into English as "young woman."  "Virgin" is nothing more than an ancient mistranslation that has been copied and recopied over the centuries.  As for the rest of the 109 prophecies that the Rabbi claims were fulfilled by Christ, to say that Jesus Christ is the only person who could fulfill them is silly. Most of the Biblical prophecies of the Messiah are vague; with many, it's hard to say whether they even deal with the Messiah or not.  The Book of Isaiah has many of these prophecies, and it can be mighty obscure.  As we have very little solid evidence for Jesus' actual life history, it's very difficult to know if he actually fulfilled any prophecies. Certainly his followers wanted to think he did, and accounts written by his followers are the only ones we have.  The power of wishful thinking is often underestimated, in my opinion.    The "Left Behind" series takes prophecy in general much too seriously.  The Book of Revelations is essentially a collection of predictions, mostly of disasters, worded in highly symbolic language. This is the same trick that Nostradamus used in his prophecies. Since the language is so symbolic, the predictions can be applied to nearly anything. Wait long enough and bad things are, of course, sure to happen. Vague disaster predictions therefore tend to come true all the time. Since the day Revelations was written, people have popped up constantly claiming that now, at last, the predicted events are all happening, and Christ's kingdom is at hand. Is the Rapture coming this time? I don't think so. Are we likely to have some bad times ahead? Yes, but not because God planned it that way. It is humans who are now causing the biggest disasters.  As an atheist, I find the fundamentalist brand of Christianity, which loves to focus on the Rapture, even less appealing than the more ordinary kind. Fundamentalists seem to assume that "God will provide" and that we don't need to think about humanity's future.   If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago.   If you are inclined to believe in the Rapture, I beg you to at least consider some contrary viewpoints. Christ said He would come as a thief in the night. Consider the possibility that He might not come for 500 more years, or 1000. Remember the parable of the talents. Do you want to face Him having ruined the planet He gave us to live on? As far as other fiction, I would suggest Heinlein's book "Job: A Comedy of Justice," which takes belief in the Rapture to its logical conclusion.  
 I was shocked to see that Maurice White had a hand in this misinterpretations of Earth Wind and Fire's classic songs. This CD was to launch or re-launch the Stax label. Its too bad the label did not launch with more orginal artists and compositions. While you may like the arrangements of the Elements' compositions, I could not get through this effort. The originals suit me just fine.  
 Oh my gaw! That other reviewer is right - I am just so, so jellllllus of Jessica and her marriage to Nick that watching these DVDs makes me want to tear my hair out and smother my husband of six years. I yearn for the life Jessie has of being: bleach-blonde, fake-tanned, married to someone whose eyes have surprisingly not fallen out of his sockets given the amount of times he rolls them at her, and whose creepy father constantly hovers around, making comments about her sex life and (...). Oh yes, jealous I am. I am soooooooo envious!  I think what I really wish I had is Jessie's intellect, ya know, that of a flea, because being stooooopid is hot, y'all. Being dumb and man-faced with (...) Oh and getting divorced after putting your marriage on the air for three years is just THE ULTIMATE cool. It's kind of like throwing out last year's fashions, you know. So if you're dying to live Jessie's life vicariously, this is the DVD for you. ENJOY 
 Ruby and the Rails framework (Ruby on Rails) have gotten major attention in the past year, primarily as an alternative to the complexities of using Java and J2EE APIs for typical N-tiered web applications using a Model / View / Controller framework.  "Programming Ruby" is supposed to be a combination of primer and reference for the Ruby language.  Compared to some of the "classics" in programming such as "Programming PERL" (Larry Wall), "The C Programming Language" (Kernigan & Ritchie) or "The C++ Programming Languate" (Stroustrup), this book falls way short as both a primer or reference.  First of all, if you're interested in Ruby at this point, you're probably interested in using the Rails framework built using Ruby.  This book provides NO information about Rails at all.  This isn't a fault of this book, it's just something you need to know because many code examples you'll find on the web aren't "Ruby" examples per se, they are examples of using APIs within the Rails framework.  Another book by this author is due out shortly covering Rails but based on the organization of this book, I would browse it in a bookstore before buying.  I've learned multiple programming langues over the years (Pascal, C, C++, a bit of Assembler, UNIX shell, PERL, Java) and I think most programmers expect any book on a programming language to tackle the material in the following order:  * installing the language * running or compiling a basic program * data types for the language * variables, assignment and data structures / objects * conditional expressions / control structures * unit / module organization for source code * advanced class / object concepts * standard libraries for DB, network, security functions, etc.  As another reviewer stated, this book doesn't explain the Ruby language's use of symbols (:somesymbol) until page 323, even though it would be logical to explain symbols at the same time Ruby's hash type is explained.  The difference between thisvariable, @thisvariable and @@thisvariable is explained very early but seems out of context because the scope of these variable types isn't clarified until the reference section.  I think most experienced programmers will find the sequencing of chapters in this book confusing.  You can definitely learn key aspects of Ruby from this book but this will definitely not be the only book you'll want or need if you are learning Ruby to use Rails.  Rails itself definitely shows some promise for simplifying some aspects of web development but I presume it will take another 2 years or so for the framework to stabilize and useful documentation to emerge.  It definitely isn't clear from this book how Ruby as an underlying language for the Rails framework was a better or needed choice over implementing something like Rails with PHP or PERL that have already achieved wide familiarity 
 The content of the book contains accurate and important information. The author and his seemingly impressive and extensive "credentials", on the other hand, are somewhat misleading.  What appears to be genuine and traditional schooling comes to the author from the Western Carolina University, where he received a B.S. in Psychology, and a Masters in Educational Counseling in 1974 and 1976; and perhaps the D.C. degree he earned in 1981 from Life University - College of Chiropractic.   What is sketchy are those degrees that afford him the most credibility: the N.D. from Clayton School of Naturopathy in 1991, and the PhD in Nutrition from the American Holistic College. Clayton College of Natural Health (Naturopathy) appears to be an easy admission, short-term, online "degree mill" college that describes their Doctorate level completion as follows:   "A degree from Clayton College can provide personal enrichment, professional growth for an ongoing career, or the foundation for a holistic health or nutrition consulting practice."    This falls quite short the scope of a Doctorate level education from one of the four Naturopathic Medicine colleges in the United States with accreditation from The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (C.N.M.E.), the only accrediting body recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Clayton is, rather, accredited by the American Association of Drugless Practitioners and the American Naturopathic Medical Accreditation Board. Both are private accrediting associations designed to meet the needs of non-traditional education (the schools) and are not affiliated with any government agency or recognized by the Dept. of Education. Furthermore, Clayton does not and can not award an ND. What they can award, as listed on their website, is a CTN: Certified Traditional Naturopath for graduates of any "doctoral" program; and a CNW: Board Certified in Nutritional Wellness for graduates of the Master of Science in Holistic Nutrition program or Ph.D. program. So Theodore Baroody saying he "completed an ND from Clayton..." does not of itself make him an ND. And since, conveniently, Clayton titles their courses with "Doctor of Naturopathy", etc., it is easy to mislead. The same is true for his PhD earned at the American Holistic College-Clayton's sister online college. Nuff said.  I hesitated in writing this review because as a person about to about to embark on an ND from the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, OR, and as a person on a mission to play some small role in the rescue of us all from the disease that is modern medicine (that was dramatic, I know, but I believe that modern medicine should be secondary and small in comparison to naturopathic healing and prevention), I wasn't sure I wanted to employ the kind of slanderous tactics certain organizations and individuals within the medical and drug industry like to employ to, in a sense, kill the growing competition of naturopathic alternatives. Truthfully, despite his misleading credentials, I wouldn't have written this review...if he wasn't selling products! If he was just passing along good information I'd have just been glad someone was doing it! Anyone! Everyone? ...But this guy is using half the alphabet after his name in what seems to me a mere platform to earn credibility in order to sell...stuff! And that sounds too much to me like the tactics of the ol' drug industry that just wants to keep us sick...and spending our hard-earned cash to be so! Not that I think his products might be harmful in any way, but my method of operation has simply become don't trust it if it can't be trusted.   So my bottom line and humble opinion is, sure, buy the book. It's simple and explained well (although there is plenty out there on the alkaline/acid balance that does not use a book and list credentials to gain credibility in order to sell you products), but think before you buy any of the products he sells in the book and on his website. Perhaps even take his supplement advice and buy them somewhere else! Because I think Mr. Baroody's extensive credentials may have earned him reasonable doubt and the additional title of...DSO, Doctor of Snake Oil 
 This book is too advanced for beginners and should be an intermediate to advanced book 
 This book is based off of a complete misconception of the truth, it has no founding nor fact in our Fathers word and just goes to show how far people using their own imagination can go.  If you like fiction read this book. But remember its just that fiction.  If you would like truth, read and understand our Fathers word.   To get you on your way. Take any King James version of the Bible and read Mark 13. You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.  Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.  Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.  Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.  Heck ... Revelation 12:3 tells you he did it to us before. Further Revelation 13:11 tells us he will look just like Christ (the lamb of God) but he speaks like satan (the dragon).   Revelation 13:13-14 tells us he does great miracles and can make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men, and he uses this power to deceive most of the people...Now I don't know about you but I have never seen anyone leading the united nations that has this type of supernatural power...Have you?    Don't be deceived its Christs #1 warning in Mark 13. The very first warning he gives "Take heed lest any MAN deceive you"  So don't be deceived by this book...its not the word of our Father...its just fiction from the minds of men, not truth from the word of God 
 This is a terrible product:  1.  The binoculars are very heavy and awkward to use.  2.  The pictures are extremely poor.  3. The company offers poor service and packaged instructions are very brief and insufficient.  W 
 This book defies description, it so bad. The dialogue is trite, the characters shallow, and the writing amateur. Sorry, Elrod, maybe you should go back to your day job. I'm ashamed I have bought all of Elrod's book on the advice of another author at Uncommon Con in Dallas/Fort Worth last year. I'm beginning to think she was in cahoots with Elrod to sell books for each other 
 As an original cast member with Florence Henderson's "Sound of Music" tour 45 years ago, I have a unique perspective about this recording.  Even the musical director comments at the end that this version of "Oliver" was not particularly well sung but that the cast had a lot of energy.  Unfortunately,(in my opinion) this energy doesn't translate suficiently to the recording and I agree - it's not particularly well sung.  Again, from the perspective of a former child performer singing with other kids, it actually is possible for a group of children to sing together and make pleasant-sounding music.  The adults in this "Oliver" aren't up to musical snuff either.  Although I haven't heard it, I'd be willing to take my chances on the original London version before settling for this one (which, by the way, was recorded in an LA studio before it even got to Broadway. 
 I have had the misfortune of having used this book and the previous edition for two statistics courses. Although the step by step sections are actually as well as they could be written, I find the explanations of the statistics behind the procedures are just unreadable. The quote below is a good example of how not to try to explain something to a novice statistics student:  "In effect, this procedure is equivalent to substituting the mean of the nonmissing ratings for the missing rating and summing the three nonmissing ratings and the substituted value for the missing rating."  This was a required text for me, so I had no choice in the matter. If you are thinking about buying this book for your own education, look elsewhere 
 I just want to let everyone know right now that this is not a good biography.  I'm all for the Bio that only concentrates in the career of the person in fact I prefer it to reading about their personal life.  but this book was just horribly self- indulgent and     un interesting to read even if you are a big fan of Johnny Depp's work.  so I would recommend saying away from this one cause there are plenty better bios than this 
 The book has not CDs, and I have to bough CD from Internet. So the price of used book + CD equal to new book. I emailed the book seller, they told me they would return me 10% of the book (1/2 of CD price), but now I haven't received the cash back. It is cheating 2 times 
 Great premise, great disappointment. Formulaic, improbable, confusing. Ludlam is clearly honing his skills in this early work. He ended a different book than he started. Bottom line: keep shopping 
  Wanting something to read on vacation, I hurriedly grabbed the Vintage paperback edition from a dusty shelf in the back of my home office.  The book had belonged to my stepson many years ago. As I thumbed through the pages, it began to fall apart.   I do not recall having to read The Sound and the Fury in college, but I knew it was famous.  Other than that, I came to the book with an open mind but expecting excellence.  To that end, I was sorely disappointed, despite some fine passages, but even those often contained unclear elements.     From the start the story came across as gibberish.  Time jumped around, and characters appeared with little or no introduction.  Gradually a sense of story began to sink in, but by then, what might have been significant in the earlier pages was already lost to me.  I wondered what connection the title had to the story.  I struggled through the entire book, finding later sections to be more coherent, particularly the last, but I was unable to gain a full appreciation of the story.  And I wasn't about to reread the book repeatedly to obtain it.   There seems to be no effort at word economy, particularly in dialogue.  There are endless rambling paragraphs and only four "chapters" for the 400 pages of text.   Worst of all, there is inadequate exposition throughout the book.  There is no introduction telling the reader how the book is constructed, most notably, that it begins with an account by an idiot.  The idea of having a family's story related by several  members if fine, so is writing in stream of conscious, but adequate exposition is needed to orient the reader.     Frustrated during the reading, I thumbed through it and discovered the appendix which described the Compson family.  Most of this material should have been presented early in the book, but even that would not have provided adequate exposition.  After reading the book, I learned that the appendix was added some time after the first edition to help the reader.  That should be a big hint that the book is lacking in exposition.  I believe that good exposition is the responsibility of a writer.   This book is more of a puzzle than a story, and the latter is sacrificed for the former.  The author does not lead you through the story; he throws you into it.  For those who marvel at the literary value of this book, I say, "The emperor has no clothes. 
 We just returned from the Yucatan and using Hidden Cancun.  We found much of it was not up to date.  I think the author visited 25 years ago,  revisited a few sites recently and used much from his previous visit without checking it out throughly.  We did not think this was a good traveling book. 
 I bought this book in the hopes that it would help solve a toy/food aggressive guarding behavior in a 30 lb dog of mine. The book instead told me how to recognize aggression. Thanks I got that already. If your dog has a real problem you will need another book 
 The pictures are small and stingy looking and since this is a picture book that's a huge flaw. Plus, the most of the homes shown were remarkably ugly. 
 Story and picture quality aside, it is very annoying that the film seems to have been transferred off center. From the opening titles to the dialog boxes, anywhere from one to three letters of the printing are missing on the left side of the screen. I guess you get what you pay for 
 Two problems.  First problem.  Let's say you're the typical kidnapper-rapist-killer.  For fun and out of postmodern boredom, you kidnap two girls off the street in New York City.  What are the odds that your randomly-chosen getaway and killing spot is going to be exactly where one of the girls lives, 60 or 70 miles away?  One in ten million?  Twenty million?   Second problem.  The movie, even with a run time of an otherwise-short 84 minutes, doesn't have enough action or development to fill the void.  In short, it's boring, and in several scenes where Craven seems more interested in the bucolic Wechester County scenery than moving the plot along, I found myself reaching for the fast-forward 
 This book isn't worth the paper or the time it would take to burn. She doesn't give real advice for the girls who are making their way in the world. Don't buy it and if you do give it to the homeless to make paper blankets 
 This has to be one of the worst Tupac DVD releases out there. It features a bunch of his fans talking about Pac's legacy. Nothing wrong with that but this people did not even know Pac on a personal level! Its no different than me and my boys gettig together and talking about how much Pac influenced us and video taping it.  On top of that the concert footage they have featured doesn't have audio. You get to watch Pac on stage moving his lips but you can't hear what he's saying. Last, it features a corny interview with him and Chris Rock. This is terrible, don't waste your money. You'll get better footage of Pac on YouTube 
 I read the reviews but, because Amazon has been so reliable over the years, decided to order the red casseroles anyway.  My order arrived today and much to my displeasure, I also received the white casseroles!  They're being returned tomorrow and I'm asking for a refund.  I do not want to take the chance of receiving another incorrect order.  My advice is do NOT order this casserole! 
 I love George Strait's music.If you look at my profile you will see that I have rated numerouse other cd's of his and gave them all 5 star. He is my favorite artist, but this cd is just plain bad. 
 I found out about this artist and this cd while watching the Early Show on  CBS one Saturday morning.  They played one song off the cd that sounded quite good. Sorry to say, there is only one or maybe two other songs that are worthwhile of my cash.   
 I love very short stories, but found Micro Fiction a disappointment.  Most of the stories were too abstract for me; stories not having a clear story line and some seeming to ramble on without much intent nor a conclusion.    The editor must have found stories like these of interest to place so many together in one book.    Other very short story book selections I've enjoyed are:  1) "The World's Shortest Stories of Love and Death: Passion, Betrayal, Suspicion, Revenge, All This and More in a New Collection of Amazing Short Stories-Each One Just 55 Words Long" edited by Steve Moss;   2) a second 55-word story book edited by Steve Moss;   3)"Flash Fiction: Very Short Stories" longer than the Micro Fictions selections, but less abstract 4) Many of the Barnes and Noble short story book selections. 
 I can't believe how many people rave about this book. I just finished it today and it was probably one of the most shallow, superficial books I have read in a very long time. New York women all acting like spoiled little girls, the whole story reminds me of the Barbie phenomenon. It they were to make a movie out of this book, they should use all the Barbie characters and let's nor forget about Ken! Such a waste of time 
 This book reduces Terragni's buildings to a series of graphic exercises in alignment and proportion.  Each elevation is studied separately but there is almost no sense of the building as a whole.  Totally disappointing exercise 
 Unfortunately, the technical engineering of the live recording in Albert Hall is of such poor quality that it compares with recordings of 30-40 years ago.  Despite Mr. Lang's artistry and that of Temirkanov and the St. Petersburg Philharmonic, I am gravely disappointed by this purchase.  By comparison with the Carnegie Hall concert and Deutsche Gramaphon's technical expertise, this really rates no stars at all 
 This 2002 copyright book I bought (thought I was getting most recent version) is not a good book. Dont buy it. Way too much fluff.   PDF File on CD didnt work at first. Eventually got it to work, but shouldn't an adobe file work wihtout having to contact tech support 
 Someone's got to tell the truth about this cliche novel to spare readers utter boredom and book shelf clutter.   If you're thinking Peter Mayle, forget it.   Peter Pezzelli's style mirrors a sophisticated middle schooler in terms of character development and use of simile.  Both are simple and spare in the most unelegant way.  From the beginning of the novel to the end, one would be hard pressed to manufacture true pathos for a man who buries his infertile wife of 45 years (the love of his life, we are told), moves to his homeland of Italy, marries the sassy daughter of his best friend who bears him a son, and lives happily ever after.  The plot is predictable and b-o-r-i-n-g 
 I read this book for a class on the Greco-Roman world. The book looks very interesting from the outset, attempting to do what is not done very often: combining the efforts of archaeology and Biblical exegesis to gain a more accurate picture of what is happening specifically in the Gospels. They cover what they believe are the ten most important discoveries (or so, they kind of smudge the lines a little bit by combining certain discoveries together, but they're up front about that, so it's ok) of both archaeology and biblical exegesis. Using these examples and many others, they attempt to show what Jesus was about and how his "kingdom movement" compared to that of John the Baptist's as well as the current empire of Rome at the time. They come to some controversial conclusions, but they attempt to back everything with evidence they give.  There are two major problems with Excavating Jesus. One problem is the form of the book. To put it bluntly, it is a poorly written book. In an attempt to put as much information into the book as they can, they tend to get lost in the information and the point they are trying to make is lost within the plethora of evidence and information. If you're looking for a casual read that will not require much effort on the part of the reader, this is not a book to pick up. The reader is required to sift through a lot of information and sometimes guess at what the authors are trying to get at because their point is not stated clearly enough. The chapters are very large, usually around 80 pages, and though each chapter is trying to focus on a specific point, by the time the reader is finished, they are somewhat lost as to what point the authors were trying to make. The thesis of the book itself is not easily discernible. The method is made very clear, but ultimately overshadows what the authors are trying to do. So the important messages that the book is trying to get across are lost in poor writing and direction.  The other major problem with the book is the conclusions. They are not bad because they are controversial; the authors make it a point to try to back everything they present with evidence. What makes the conclusions problematic is that they are all fairly extreme. If there is any room to doubt something, the authors immediately jump to the farthest conclusion. For example, there is little evidence to suggest that there is a synagogue in Nazareth at the time Jesus would have lived there as Luke records. The authors automatically conclude that the events that take place in chapter 4 of Luke didn't happen. That's a fairly extreme jump to make, and there are other plausible explanations that can be made. The book does this quite a bit.  Overall, the book is not good. It's worth reading if one is willing to take the time to sift through the poor writing, but if you're looking for a simple book about how archaeology and exegesis can work together, I would look elsewhere, though the selection is somewhat thin.  One positive aspect of the book is in the discourse of the first chapter about the James Ossuary. This is a fascinating discussion and I think an important on when it comes to good archaeology and exegesis. However, it'd be better to check the book out from a theological library and read that selection rather than purchase the book for that section 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 The title is misleading.  It should be something like 100 Drawing Assignments, or perhaps Prison Sentences.  This book doesn't emphasize creativity--especially if you think of it as a way to freely express the art that's locked inside you (which seemed likely since it is published by Shambhala Books).  It's a bunch of drawing lessons by college professors.  Very few of the exercises are intended to help one overcome artist's block or to loosen up and draw what you really feel.  It doesn't teach you to draw.  It is simply 100 briefly described (and, unfortunately, rather boring) lessons.  One example is the 24-hour drawing.  You spend 24 cumulative hours on one drawing.  I could never force myself to do that.  I think it sounds cruel for any teacher to ask such a thing of anyone.  Not all of the ideas were that bad, but they were mostly very dry (bringing to mind the old saying, "In case of flood, throw this in; it's dry enough").  If you are a college professor and want to stick to the usual fare offered in college art courses, this book might be right up your alley.  If you are a different kind of teacher, there are plenty of books that don't require heavy adaptation to make them usable 
 How anyone could rate this movie 4-5 stars is beyond belief. This was such a contrived movie that had a simple plot that went nowhere. As I watched this movie I could not figure out if it was meant to be a comedy or a drama. It was never very funny and both lead actors, playing one white and one adopted black brother, had scenes in the movie that were terrible. Romany Malco has a scene where he is running around in his underwear for no apparent reason accept to show off his body. He jumps out of bed when his cell phone rings, runs down the stairs and then outside and back in just to gather everyone in the house and scold them, in his drawers? He is talentless and idiotic as a "brother" in France that no one can relate to. Paul Rudd is likable but his shining scene is when he comes back to the chateau drunk and "grossly" tells off everyone - people he has known for less than a week! The servants are the best actors in the movie and play their parts well...but can't make up for the dismal rest. Ludicrous - a bad movie that probably could have been funny if they had went for laughs instead of drama. This is another example of a rental that you think is going to be good but then disappoints 
 Well, I'm less than impressed upon wrapping up a listen to this album.  While it has a few standout tracks among the 11 provided, for the most part they are all mediocre.  I was never a fan of `Vertigo' but I am a fan of U2 so I opted to give the entire CD a listen, and while the remaining singles `City of Blinding Lights' and `Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own' are classic U2 and wonderful listens, songs like `Original of the Species' and `Love and Peace of Else' really bring down the value of the CD.  Some of these tracks serve their purpose.  `Miracle Drug' quickly redeems the album after the dreadful opener `Vertigo' but `Love and Peace of Else' and `All Because of You' quickly knock it back down, and while `A Man and a Woman' struggles to be ballad worthy the following four tracks end the album in complete turmoil.  `Yahweh' has Bono coming off as an out of tune karaoke refugee and ends the album on such a sour note I'm almost forced to swear if off forever, but I won't do that, because they're U2 and on name alone they were saved, this time 
 Without religion it would be easy to see good men doing good things and bad men doing bad things.  With religion bad men can do bad things and justify those things under the guise of religion.  However good men can also do bad things behind the same religion.  Here we have a fine example of either.  You can pick which man you see here.  Whichever way you go it does not remove the fact that BAD things have been done.  That is the message of this book 
 This book is a prime example of the old adage: "Those who can't do, teach." The author of this book has never been the primary author of a major scientific paper (he is a professor of English), but he tries to give advice on how to write an effective scientific article. Because he has little to say on the subject, much of the text is made up of amusing anecdotes and quips rather than substantive guidelines. An example of the unhelpful advice he doles out is on page ninety-two, where he advises the reader to submit a typed, rather than handwritten, manuscript to the publisher. He litters his chapters with cute Peanuts cartoons depicting Snoopy getting rejection letters from publishers: a great way to take up space, but not useful to someone seeking practical advice on how to prepare a scientific article. He also gives advice on good grammar, which is more within his area of expertise. But there are better books on the subject of good writing, the classic example of which is Strunk and White's Elements of Style. I would advise the fledgling scientific writer to read many scientific articles in order to learn how to construct them effectively. On the other hand, if you want to learn how to write a whole book about something of which you know almost nothing, Dr. Day's "How to Write & Publish a Scientific Paper" would be a great place to start 
 I LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA.  AFTER READING DR. MOLDWIN'S BOOK MY HUSBAND DROVE US TO SEE HIM IN NEW YORK BECAUSE I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN I JUST WANTED TO DIE. IT TOOK ONLY ABOUT 2 MONTHS TO GEY AN APPOINTMENT.  HE EXAMINED ME AND TOLD ME EXACTLY WANT TO DO TO GET BETTER, CAUSE IC PATIENTS ARE ALL DIFFERENT.  I AM 100% CURED.  MY OTHER DOCTORS CANNOT BELIEVE IT. 100% CURED.  WITH PRAYERS AND FOLLOWING WHAT HE TOLD ME TO DO AFTER A YEAR IN PAIN 24 HOURS A DAY, I AM NOW PAIN FREE! 
 It's summer, and my reading matter always lightens up significantly! I spotted this book at the library and figured, why not!  I know, I said never again for Danielle Steel, but the plot interested me.  How bad could it be, right?    Well, there's good news and bad news.  The good news is that the plot is different for DS, and held my interest enough so that, unlike Impossible, I actually finished it in one day.  The bad news is that this book seems entirely devoid of any attempt at editing.  The repetition is maddening. When reading becomes a chore, and you can skip entire pages and not miss anything, it's time to start some serious editing.    Here are some suggested areas of improvement:  - Shorten up the paragraphs.  They should not exceed a page! - Try spending a little more time developing the characters.  I couldn't "see" Sarah - when I read, I want to be able to clearly visualize the people and after hundreds of pages, I never had a clear vision of the main character - Pay attention to style. Every time she spelled out 30,000, I wanted to pull my hair out.  Small thing, but numbers over nine should always be written in numerals unless they are at the beginning of a sentence.  As I've written before, DS needs a good editor. This book could have been one of her best to date.  
 I opened this book very neutrally--I had never heard anything about Susan Sontag except her name, in a preface to an Annie Leibovitz book.  I still can't believe some of the things I read.  Sontag mentions in the foreword that she has an "obsession" with photography.  I would argue that she has an obsession with resenting photography. She begins by comparing a camera to a gun and the act of taking a picture to rape.  To a certain point, I can understand this--being photographed is a very self-conscious experience.  But somehow, I think rape victims would laugh at this comparision.  Self-consciousness is not exactly rape.  Also, she seems to believe that all photography is taken completely without the consent of the subject(s); they are innocent victims being raped by guns.  The last time I checked, most of the photographers she mentions (Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Edward Weston, Julia Margaret Cameron) took pictures only with express permission, and many (Eugene Atget, Ansel Adams, etc.) did not take pictures of people at all.  Almost all good pictures, with the exception of Henri Cartier-Bresson type photography, requires tacit consent between photographer and subject.   Sontag's resentment seems to come mostly from the resentment generated by photography's replacement of writing in description.  Specifically, she says that whereas photograpy "steals" the pain of others, writing uses only one's own pain.  This is funny, since I remember reading about how Jane Austen's neighbors complained because their lives were being stolen for her books.  Ever since the art of storytelling began writers and storytellers have been "stealing" other people's lives, their pain, etc.  Fitzgerald used Zelda's insanity just as David Bailey photographed Marie Helvin.  I believe that the art of writing and the art of photography are incredibly similar, and Sontag sounds very sour grapes.  How is Strand's photographing the famous "Blind Woman" different from Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood?" My biggest objection to Sontag, however, is her lack of either proof or explanation.  She simply states opinions as if they were facts, and then stops.  For example, according to Sontag, Weston is now regarded as antiquated and cliche.  Really?  Somehow I thought, considering the worth of his work, his exhibitions in museums, and the wealth of books devoted to him, as well as his inclusion in every basic photography class, that he was still very highly regarded.  I'm sure that Sontag regards him as antiquated and cliche, but this is very different from the "everyone" she generally to be present and in full agreement with her. Sontag also concentrates exclusively on one genre and attacks photography as a whole through that genre.  Diane Arbus's photos are apparently taking horrible advantage of everyone pictured in them, and are freakish visions of a bleak world--therefore all photographs in the world are taking horrible advantage and are freakish visions of a bleak world.  I can understand why some people find Arbus's photos terribly offensive, but I think only the extremely deluded would use her as representative of all photography. One last aspect of Sontag's book, which I found the most offensive, is her assumption that a picture is stealing the pain of others and, in a sense, profiting from it artistically.  This is despite her inclusion in her "Anthology of Quotations" of Richard Avedon's interview where he stated that the pictures he took of other people were more about him than about them.  Everyone who has ever practiced photography with any passion can testify to the truth of this statement, hence my conclusion that Sontag has probably never really picked up a camera.  Look at Avedon's pictures of a tortured Marilyn Monroe, and then read Arthur Miller's "After the Fall," which describes a tortured and pill-popping Marilyn Monroe.  There is very little difference, except that in Avedon's pictures Monroe still retains some amount of dignity, whereas in Miller's play she becomes a demon of hysteria and cruelty.  In the end, although I am both a photographer and a writer, I would say that writing has ten times the power of misrepresentation and "stealing the pain of others" than does photography 
 I ordered two items for my sister. After almost three weeks my money was returned with a notice that the items were not in stock. The items were a present for her. I will not order from this seller again. 
 I did the research on this product and it was one of the best. I don't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use. I have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included. One if not the only reason I had purchased it. I e-mailed tiger.com and received no reply. If your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way 
 Like Bernard Lewis, this author likes to portray a clash between West and Middle East.  But look at the other countries:  nobody is fighting the west, not even the Chinese.  Does anybody really think we can't get along?  This book is true only for the Middle East.    As for the rest of the thesis, that developing countries catch up with developed countries, this is a well known economic phenomena, nothing worth fretting over 
 This book is not for someone who just wants to pick up enough French to get them through a trip unless they have a good ear and memory.  I found "French in 10 Minutes a Day" much better as you must write what you learn in a workbook 
 I have read all of Kingsolver's fiction and am a big fan; however, I found these essays preachy and even irritating. Her voice is just a little too pious and seems to assume her audience is made up of clueless shopaholic shell-collecting fast food-chomping dimwits. In attempting to create parables out of "State of the World 2001" issues, she made broad and compelling problems seem almost pedantic. Her usual originality, insightfulness, and clever wit does not come through. I was disappointed 
 I was very disappointed by this novel. Roth is a talented writer, and I had hoped that he would be able to create a truly compelling novel out of such a promising idea. However, the novel just didn't work for me. The characters felt something like cardboard cut outs and seemed inconsistent in their behavior. The plot spun out of control and became completely fantastic and quite unbelievable. Read something else by Roth - I think you'll enjoy one of his earlier works more than this 
 we received it with broken cover. It didn't work properly and stopped running every hour. We tried different ways to make it run, but nothing worked. We've returned it. It's just waste of money. On the other hand the COW-humidifier which we bought at the same time is fine and running well. No complaints 
 This guy is obsessed with vegetable shortening.  Talk about bland cookies.  Not to mention "1001" is a total lie.  Anyone notice the 'repeat' recipes with cleverly (yeah right) disguised new names?  Snickerdoodles, Nibbles and Cinnamon Balls are EXACTLY the SAME recipes...  just in a different ORDER in printing.  So are the Mexican Wedding Cakes (what a clever name for the IDENTICAL second version: in Spanish!).  Funny that the author talks about his father on his deathbed confessing his 'secret' ingredient in the 'best' chocolate chip cookies.  you guessed it: SHORTENING!  Whatever happened to butter.. 
 I never reveived this book.  The Nancy Drew came in the mail, but that is it.  Who do I need to contact????? 
 I was waiting for this dryer to come in the mail for a while now.  I looked forward to using it.  Yesterday, I got it in the mail and used it.  I thought with the attachment, it would be more convenient to straighten my hair, not true.  I used it for 10 minutes and it shut off on me.  I waited 10 minutes for it to cool and start up again but it never did.  I will not buy this product again.  Do they manufactures think that it takes only 10 minutes to dry hair?  They should have tested this dryer out before sending out into the marketplace.  I am very disappointed 
 I had this on my Christmas list and was very specific that DH order this one BECAUSE of the included rechargable battery.  Well, as with the other reviewer, there is no battery included.  I haven't contacted Amazon YET, but I plan to.  This is blatant false advertising - and I have been watching this item for MONTHS.  It is a nice case though and I look forward to taking my printer on the go-go with it 
 this book is a Rip OFF of Peter Lynch's One Up On Wall Stee 
 This was not my favorite or most useful book for when I set out to homestead. Although it has a lot of good information in it, it is too dense and hard to read through, and too hard to find info immediately as I need it. I read it occasionally, but found the Storey books much more useful for practical, look-it-up-now information. 
 I wasted time reading this book that I will never get back.  It was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out.  I only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way I thought it would.  Buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly, and for predicting how the story goes.  But, I would not waste the time if I were you 
 It's a book that follows the racism that the mexicans have to take in the U.S. Plain simple. In the XIX century the Irish were the discriminated, in the XX century, the blacks and in the XXI century, the mexicans.  The author encourage the discrimination against mexicans,and keeps going with the old thinking of the Manifest Destiny that took Mexico half of his territory. In a way, americans should be worried, because mexicans are doing to americans what they did to mexicans in 1846: invading the territory, ignoring the local authorities and imposing its own culture. A perfect book for KKK wannabes, skinheads and pseudo-minute men. 
 I think Lynn Picknett sat down one night with a big bottle of wine and decided to rant her feelings, her research and strong opinions on some paper. She has some interesting ideas about who the Magdalene may have been or come from, and then never mentions it again- in fact here isn't much specifically about Magdalene at all.  And statements like "..when the Gnostics were silly they were extremely silly"- excuse me?? I resisted reading this book for a long time because friends who, like me, thought The Templar Revelation was an exellent book, didn't really like this one. Well, I gave it a shot, and it was not worth it 
 The movie is great.  The DVD is not.  The French soundtrack does not play properly.  I had to return it for a refund 
 The lives of a cell  is an alright book that has a outstanding  information that you can use in everyday life. It has a lot of chapters in the book like every page there is always something important. The author Lewis Thomas did an ok job or arranging it. But I did not like the fact that  your learning something and all of a sudden something random comes up and you are back about cells. It seems like a very interesting book. I learned a lot by reading this. This is a type of a book for a 20 year old person who is interested in science technology and physics. Not a kind of a book for a 9th grader to be reading. But I give the author credit because even some things interested me and I am a very hard critic.  Lewis Thomas' book is a basically  about  a well written collection of essays. It views a biological life also people opinions on it. In most chapters it tells you about things that could happen that are bad. If something hit a cell and it could cause damage to your body. For instance they talk about germs, and pheromones things like that. The guy is saying threw out the book we must learn to have a more caring and protective attitude toward Nature and environment. (which I agree on ). In this book you learn about a lot of things like DNA, mitochondria and bacteria, pheromones,meningitis,diptheria things like that. It has a lot of biological facts and theories, but does not really make the reader understand. You need to have strong knowledge of all these scientific terms to understand some of the book. I would probably rate this a 2 because I need more knowledge to understand the concept on this book. 
 The other reviewers will tell you about the book.  I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read.  What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism.  I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published.  I guess most people will sell their souls for money.  Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments).  The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men.  The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters.  This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women.  So this is just a warning.  If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books.  
 Given high acclaims this film has collected over time, I was glad to pick up a VHS copy at my local library sale.  Began to watch it last night.  I was able to sit thru the part 1.  When the tape ended, I was actually glad. I felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1!  The movie is DREARY to the max.  People portrayed are irrational, lost, uncommunicative, and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers.  In some way, this movie reminded me of the dreary winter (lasting 6 months!) I spent in Russia a couple of years ago...   To me, the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of Soviet state (1920-1956).  For survivors, nothing made any sense anymore, except perhaps fear and evil, as people in this dreary film reflects.  People have been already destroyed in their souls.  They are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the Bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience.   Maybe that is the real meaning of this movie.  To really reflect what happened to people's psyche after Lenin and Stalin's UNLIMITED TERROR, they found a parallel in Mongol's devastation and oppression of medieval Russia.  In both cases, people were left shattered, helpless, irrational, withdrawn,  and autistic.   
 As someone who is very interested in healthy eating and living, I was actually appalled by this magazine.  It is ostensibly health conscious, but upon closer examination it ignores important health information.  For example, in one issue, it had a whole article about diabetes and how, thanks to the miracles of science, diabetics can now eat sugary foods.  It proceeded to give a table of artificial sweeteners explaining when to use which.  A truly health conscious person would know that aspartame is suspected of causing cancer, and that the only real way to avoid diabetes is to only include a reaonable and moderate amount of sugar in your diet.  I was disappointed with the magazine 
 This textbook relies on more handwaving arguments than my Quantum textbook! Griffiths seems to be under the impression that he is an astounding mathematician and the reader can barely integrate. The "proofs" of almost every key concept are either fleshed out in "Well suppose... then this might happen..." or altogether left to the reader. It was a fun challenge to actually write a proof for a lot of them, too... maybe Griffiths should have tried it when he wrote the book. If the reader does every single problem in the book, he or she may have a mid-undergrad level understanding of basic E&M. Very little relativity, and no Quantum mechanical aspects are covered (if I remember correctly) 
 He writes with a lot of descriptive detail, to a fualt. Every person he mentions gets their biography put in. Way too much extra junk about people no one would ever here of. Chapters start out with the continuing story and quickly break down into the life story of some high ranking account for the PGA, and so on. Read only if you need to get some sleep 
 This book purports to examine the TV series Buffy and Angel with respect to the characters relationships as "families."  I thought that sounded like a great idea, so I read this book.  Unfortunately, the essays in this work are quite muddled.  The author begins each essay by stating what he will be focusing on for the duration of the essay, but then he inevitably meanders away from the topic.  Maybe he should consider creating an outline before he starts writing and sticking to it!  Another problem I had with the essays in this book is the fact that the information about the shows that is presented within them is often incorrect.  I found that incredibly distracting and annoying.  I am giving this book the two stars for the idea --- it gets no stars for the execution of the idea 
 At best, this is an oversimplified rehash of Betty Edwards', "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain." As a much better alternative to both of these books, look into Brenda Hoddinott's, "Drawing for Dummies." Brenda's method is very methodical and step-by-step, not to mention fun and a little silly,(just like Brenda!) whereas this particular book calls for a "If you only look at what your drawing, it will be easy!" attitude. Nothing truly worth doing is easy. Check out Ms. Hoddinott's Drawspace.com website as well. You won't be sorry you did 
 So I've got a bookstore, and it seems like everyone who ever attempts this book calls it tedious and gives up. So why is it that I see so many positive reviews here? Myself, I thought the authentic feel was a definite plus, (much of the time I did feel that I was reading an ancient memoir) but as for being "a page turner," as somebody else called it, you've got to be joking. This book is one of the slowest novels I've ever read. I did it on audio book and I kept falling asleep. It was a lot like sitting in Driver's Ed. after lunch and trying to keep my eyes from going out of focus. Creighton has written some pretty fun stuff, some of it even mildly thought provoking, but his is neither. Timeline and the two Jurassic Park books fit well into the whole "roller coaster of a book" thing, and personally I thought Sphere was great.  I realize that there isn't too much in the way of popular Viking fiction out there and so I suppose if you've got to have a Valhalla fix you could check this out, but I'd still recommend the Kirk Douglas movie "Vikings" over this book. Or maybe the book "Grendel" by John Gardener, which is based on the same epic poem. But this book just feels to much like a boring history lesson. 
 Terrible and useless even for a book on AI for budding game developers. The theory and explanations in this book are sometimes decent but more often than not quite lacking. (es: in one of the first chapter the author uses Bresenham algorithm without taking the time to explain it). The use of tile based examples introduce unnecessary overhead, and the continuos attempts to introduce physics related code and references to the author's other book on game physics are just plain annoying. The range of subjects covered is very broad (chasing and evading, pathfinding, emergent behaviours, rule based reasoning, bayesian networks, neural networks, fuzzy logic, finite state machines, genetic algorithms), definitely too broad to treat each of these subject in decent depth and with clarity. Example code is of low quality and just superficially object-oriented. If you are looking for a decent introduction to game AI I recommend Matt Buckland "Programming Game AI by Example" and "AI Techniques for Game Programming".  
 Save your money for something more useful. There is nothing in this book that makes it worth the price. A far better book on bear market investing is "Riding the Bear" by Sy Harding. And for concepts about timing the market and investing both long and short, see Les Masonson's "All About Market Timing" and Deborah Wair's "Timing the Market. 
 I had 2 pieces of this item, - both had similar problems. First and major one is water and steam leakage between the filter holder and the machine. This, I believe, is due to poor Chinese assemblage. Secondly, "perfect froth" nipple has terrible persistent ordor of the material its made of, which perfectly transmits to your drink. Krups should've thought of changing this design and set better quality control over assemblage. The item was returned.  
 I am SO perplexed at the popularity of this item!  When it first came out, I purchased one for my son (he was around six months old at the time).  He immediately figured out how to get out of the seat by leaning back, extending his arms behind him, and straightening his legs, so I returned it.  By the time I had my second child (a girl), Bumbomania had kicked in, and these seats were EVERYWHERE.  I began to think that my son's experience was a fluke, and I purchased another one for my daughter.  Low and behold, she immediately figured out how to get out of the seat in the EXACT SAME WAY!  So I returned the second Bumbo as well, but not before noticing that the instructions did contain a warning that some children "may" be able to get out of the seat.  In conclusion, although the Bumbo may work great for some - BEWARE!  If you have little Houdinis like I do, this product is simply not safe 
 Like many other reviewers, I had to purchase this book for one of my CS courses. As a reference book, it gets no more than 1 star. I find it often confusing in its explanations, incomplete code examples and uneven pace. I understand that it was designed to be a textbook, but it miserably fails to be of any value to a student. For 100+ bucks, I expected a lot more 
 Supernova doesn't seem to quite know what it's trying to be and as a result never quite succeeds on any level.  As a disaster epic, it can never quite match the visuals of big screen offerings that have dealt out similar levels of global destruction.  The sequences of the sun's increasing activity are pretty enough to look at but never convince and feel disconnected from the rest of the action.  And scenes of the Eiffel Tower, Taj Mahal and Sydney Opera House being destroyed by giant fireballs descending from the sky are largely unnecessary, only further detracting from the believability of the whole endeavour with some average at best effects work.  It's at its best when it presents the aftermath of the effects of the sun's activity on a smaller scale, emphasising the human drama amongst the chaos that ensues.   The science behind the storyline seems rather shaky at best, as evidenced by a key scene involving a piece of elementary and unconvincing mathematics.  This could, however, be overlooked if the treatment of the scenario of a sun about to consume our solar system was in itself engaging.  Here again, though, Supernova is only a partial success.  The notion of an underground hive intended to ensure mankind's survival if life above ground were to become unsustainable is one of the more interesting themes on offer, and so it's a shame it's never fully explored.  Instead, there are a number of subplots and situations of varying levels of interest.  Of these, Shepard's ruminations on his island retreat are amongst the most poignant as he contemplates his life and work and awaits an end he deems inevitable; his final scene is poorly executed, however, and only detracts from what has gone before.  And the plot surrounding a horribly clichéd escaped killer stalking Richardson's family is utterly pointless, providing a "climax" more befitting of a conventional thriller.  Perhaps this sought to play safe and provide a recognisable climactic conflict for one of its protagonists, but at this point the movie seems to forget its own premise altogether.   In a variable cast, it is really only the ever-excellent Lance Henriksen who shines, lending sympathy and believable motivation in limited screen time to a character that might very easily have seemed one-dimensional.  Luke Perry seems oddly miscast as Dr Richardson and never convinces the viewer of his academic credentials, and neither is his bond to the rest of his family ever properly established.  This rendered their subplot all the more uninteresting.  Overall, this is an entirely watchable Apocalyptic TV movie so long as you don't think too deeply about it or watch too closely.  For the most part, though, it feels like a missed opportunity that could have taken much bolder decisions and been far more affecting as result.  Lukewarm at best.  --Adam Chamberlain Revelation Magazin 
 I've read funnier quotes at a post-apocalypse planning meeting. I'd like to believe that as I get closer to 50 (not quite there yet--but soon)  my sense of humor is growing more sophisticated. Why then a book filled with  humor best appreciated by those with the most juvenile sense of humor? I  don't know if the author's name really is Witte, but based upon this title,  he should consider changing it to Hackneyed. After finishing this book, you  won't be amused, only depressed 
 Gays have been remarkably successful and promoting their social agenda not just in the US, but throughout the industialized world.  The last great obstacle they face is overcoming religious prejudice against their practices, so it is not surprising that when confronted with scripture that unequivocally condemns same-sex sexuality, they put themselves through all manner of logical and interpetive contortions to show that the Bible doesn't really mean what it says quite clearly.  There is little point in going through the book argument by argument and offering a rebuttal.  And I will say right off that in a way I agree at least partially with the author, when he says, for instance, that we should try to understand biblical teaching within context--historical/cultural analysis is a valid method of scriptural analysis.    But the author claims, outrageously, that we modern-day Christians are interpreting biblical prohibitions against homosexuality  from a position of our own cultural bias. Nothing could be further from the truth.  That people during biblical times didn't recognize homosexuality as a "condition" (for lack of a better word) isn't particularly relevant, since they weren't codemning BEING homosexual, but ENGAGING in homosexual sex.  And this is pretty much the Catholic church's position today.  It is not a sin to BE homosexual.  It is a sin, though--borne of a "grave disorder" over which the person may very well have no control--to engage in same-sex sexual activity...just as it is a sin to engage in pre-marital sex, adultery, and so on.  It is a given, speaking from a Christian perspective, that people are borne imperfect and subject to all manner of temptations toward bad behavior.  How we act on those temptations is entirely up to us, though.  That we experience impure impulses is not proof that God wants us to indulge those impulses.  Which leads to an important part of Helminiak's argument.  He offers this:  1. Some people are born homosexual. It is a condition over which they have no control, like skin color, and height.  2.  According to scripture, God creates us.  Therefore, God creates homosexuals.  3. If we regard homosexuals as flawed, then we must assume God created them flawed deliberately.  4.  This would make God evil.  5.  God cannot be evil.  6.  Therefore, homosexuals must not be flawed.  7. If God did not create them flawed, he created them correctly.  8. God would not condemn what he created correctly.  9. Since God created homosexuals correctly, and does not, therefore, condemn them, it is wrong for us to condemn homosexual acts.  Sounds reasonable, right?  It's not, though.  First, #1 is never proved.  You can't assume a major premise unless for all practical purposes it is recognized as factual.  It must be widely accepted, or arrived at inductively in the argument.  The author provides no evidence to establish his major premise, that homosexuality is an inherent and immutable trait like skin color; he merely offers it as fact. It isn't a fact.  And there is plenty of reason to doubt his premise.  Once the major premise as been destroyed, the whole argument becomes moot, invalid.  But let's continue anyway....  He goes on to assert that God created homosexuals, and would not create people he knew he would condemn.  The idea of predestination varies among denominations, so I don't even want to go there.  What all denominations agree on, though, is that we live in a fallen world, and that all people are prone to sin.  It is as easy to say that God creates the pedophile, the dog-raper, the serial killer, and that we are foolish for considering these people flawed, because God created them.  Clearly, though, we are not wrong to consider these people flawed.  And just as clearly, God does not want these people to molest children or dogs, or murder their fellow humans seriatim.  Unless God is evil, which Helminiak already agrees he is not.  So Helminiak's argument falls apart because the principle he relies on is far from applicable to other other circumstances, other people.  To say God created man is not to say that God micromanages the creation and growth and daily actions of all people, or condones their poor choices and immoral actions.  Helminiak happily dispenses with reading scripture figuratively when it suits his purpose, but here seems to adhere to a level of literalness that I don't encounter outside of the strictest sort of fundamentalism.  He isn't consistent in his argumentation.  This is a book by an author who clearly knows ahead of time the conclusion he wants to arrive at, and seeks to find a way--any way--to get there.  He's not alone.  This isn't the only book I've read on the subject; the others make similar arguments, deliberately misinterpreting the koine Greek of the NT so that, in their minds, they can believe that when Paul condemns men who lay with men, what he is really condemning is men laying with male prostitutes, or boys.  But these interpretations are without foundation and fly in the face of the overwhelming bulk of biblical scholarship.  As an interesting insight into where Helminiak is coming from, consider what he has said in a PBS interview:  "I can remember the first time I deliberately went and had sex with someone. It was somebody I had known, who had approached me ... and I was being sympathetic because he's telling me he's gay... I thought God was happy that finally I got off my duff and did something. God said, 'Yay! Finally you're growing up! You're starting to live.'"  Say what?  An ordained minister of God, who has taken vows of obedience and celibacy, goes out, has sex with a man he met in his pastoral capacity, and God says "Yay!"?  Is this guy SERIOUS?  The Bible's prohibition against homosexual sex is not a cultural convention of an ancient people. The condemnations appear in Paul's vice lists.  Scripturally speaking, homosexual acts are, simply and unequivocally, vices to be avoided.  If you want to know what the Bible REALLY says about same-sex relationships, read the Bible, not Helminiak.   
 I contacted the author, Sheila Mello, to purchase this title directly from the publisher.  Sheila was very rude and unhelpful.  She hung up on me once.  After contacting her again she told me that it was too much trouble for her to sell me one copy and said to go elsewhere.  Personally, this is very bad business and not a good way to promote your book 
 I bought this book specifically because Davy Crockett himself was the author. I thought it would contain his entire autobiography, but the book ends before he goes off to Congress. The book and type are also much larger than I realized they would be. This book is more suitable for younger children. As an adult, I am quite disappointed 
 This so-called Guide To Charm is not guiding at all. I personally do not feel more charming after reading it, and have furthermore...no clue as to how I can improve my charming skills and yet...I thought that was what the book was about. Believe me, you do not need this book. The authors keep saying they would give you advice on such and such and then apologize and mention it's really not the point of such a small book. In one word: unuseful. There is no hint, no advice, not a thing I did not know by common-sense. Don't Waste your money on this book. There are such good ones on this matter but this very one 
 Tom Clancy is at his best when describing military weapons systems and tactics. He does less well with his human characters who seem real enough during their missions, but become two dimensional when the action stops. The magic of a good book is that the characters come to life. Unfortunately, in Rainbow Six they never really do, and so I never really cared what happened to them. More disturbing is the amoral tone of the book. Tom Clancy takes the position that counter-terrorism teams have to crossover to the dark side in the service of the good.  This seemed supportable until the final mission where I felt the "good guys" lost their humanity.  If you give up the moral high ground and sink to the level of terrorists are you really any better then they are 
 This movie is true garbage.  It made no sense, had no real plot, did not offer any clever deaths or humor, or gratuitous skin.  The ending leaves you feeling stupid for having watched it all the way      to the end.  I had to wake myself up 3 times during this movie, I wish I had just stayed asleep.  The horror, the horror.  Actually, the sheriff was kind of wierd and creepy because you knew he was not acting (there was no acting) and you worry that someone like that is walking around out there.  I think the people who liked this movie are trying to sell their used copies that are good for landfill only.   Basically, the plot was about to make some headway at the end, but then they ran out of money or maybe their 486 computer they were using to edit it died.  Or maybe they got bored and walked off the set.  Becuase their was no explanation of who killed everyone, and everyone except the innocent girl was dead.  It had a chainsaw killing and lots of scythe beheading, but I just could  not care.  If I could give this movie negative stars I would, but 1 star is the lowest.  
 The setting of this book is beautiful, exotic, and interesting. The author, unfortunately, does nothing to take advantage of this. I am shocked that this book could possibly have won a National Book Award. It must mean that either the award itself is meaningless, or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year -- which I doubt. The topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else, as far as I am concerned. I can't imagine it being done worse! Tuck's writing style -- short vignettes or episodes, one after another -- is terribly ineffective and disjointed. I felt completely detached from all of the characters. I didn't feel like I gained any understanding of who they were, and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies. Another thing that completely irritated me were Tuck's sexual references. Throughout the novel, Tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter (a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest, for example). These sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader; all they did was gross me out. They were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy, not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story. I don't know what Tuck was trying to do in this novel. I think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level: It is not entertaining. It is not profound. It is not educational. It is not beautiful. At only 248 pages, I can't say it was even a quick read. Utterly forgettable, once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it. 
 Bless Alan's heart! God bless you Alan! This is a terrible book. It isn't even enough to get a conservative angry 
 You would think by now I would have learned not to judge a book by its cover, but that's exactly what I did in this case. The picture on the front cover is charming. The words "Fresh, engaging, and authentically British" from a Booklist reviewer are splashed on the cover. And that reeled me in.  If you like the cozy mystery genre, and are a fan of Agatha Christie, Anne Perry, Dianne Day, Rita Mae Brown, or Margaret Miles, this may not be the book for you. If you liked the 90's TV show Roseanne, you're in for a treat. She's back, this time as a British house cleaner named Lois. Ann Purser goes out of her way to make Lois unsympathetic, and her husband Derek and daughter Josie downright annoying and unlikeable. It seems as though Purser's trying to break down the stereotype of the British mystery by choosing working-class characters in modern times, which I completely respect, but she's building up another stereotype at the same time: that working-class people are brash, crass, and argumentative.  Aside from unsympathetic and sometimes annoying characters, the conclusion of this mystery is a bit far-fetched, and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. The sad thing is, I'm not even all that curious about having them answered.  A very unsatifying read. 
 You could hardly find a greater betrayal of the Situationist movement in all of its aspects, than this book, which translates a chaotic, exciting and iconoclastic movement into a boring and platitudinous addition to the obligatory academic discourse about everything.  Throw this thing in the trash, don't even resell it, certainly don't donate it to any charities or libraries.  Go right now instead and find "The Situationist International: A User's Guide" by Simon Ford, you won't regret it.  I swear to God I am not lying and I have no institutional or other affiliation that would conflict with this judgment 
 You would think that with this band, this would be a great disc, right? Sadly, it's not all that great. Lou and Quine were at loggerheads at the time. As a result, Quine's guitar is oddly muted and minimized on much of this. As much as I love Lou Reed, and I do, he will never be the guitar player that Robert Quine was. This CD suffers, as a result, from Lou's lack of guitar skills - even on his own music, by his own standards. The second thing that makes it a not-buy is Lou's refusal or inability to sing. He simply shouts his way through all the songs. The third reason to give this a pass is that there are no dynamics. All the songs are played as loud as possible, meaning that ear fatigue sets in a little over halfway through. It begins to sound very samey after a while. Lou's best live set remains the semi-bootleg "American Poet" album. Even for a Lou Reed fan, this is not a must, I'm sorry to say. 
 My wife bought this for our daughter for christmas several years back and frankly it is a terrible book. This coming from a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. It basically has no story or interesting plot at all. The purpose of the book is just to have a bunch of tongue twisters just to have them there. I really was surprised how bad this book was since I love so many other Dr. Seuss books (our child has at least 15 other seuss books we love). Honestly, my child picks this book periodically for bed time stories, and my wife and i will cringe when reading this. Also, our child doesn't really seem to care for it either. 
 18 Jun 2005  As the book progressed, it got more and more egoistic, to the point where it becomes a turn-off towards the end of the book. I am surprised that there was so little mentioned of Hakeem. Shaq's attitude seems to be that since he can score, he does not respect centers who can't score. Whereas he respect Bill Russell. But he does give Kobe his fair share of spotlight. The other book I read was an unabashed hype of Shaq, so this is a big improvement. 
 I found this book sadly lacking in substance and quality activities. Spend your money on Days of Knights and Damsels by Carlson 
 I purchased this book with good intentions and have never written a negative review on a book, but I had to go out of my way to make note on this book. Although I can see how others could find value in the book, the author lost his credibility with me after two chapters of me underlining statements he was making that he stated as fact when they were just his opinion. I won't get into every detail, but for example he classifies real estate investors as short-term, mid-term, or long term and then states "the long term investor won't care about purchase price" (what is he talking about?) and then fails to understand the fact a long term investor can capture appreciated gains through monetizing the asset (i.e. the house) through additional equity lines or refinances, rather than state this simple fact which is very important as it would allow a long term investor to avoid transaction costs and tax implications but still receive cash from the appreciation he states the long term investor will hold the home not very leveraged; that is totally untrue many long term investors are highly leveraged and continually borrow against their properties and appreciation. Anyway, not a big deal but atleast he didn't call his book the "Bible to Real Estate Finance" or something like that because it is not. It is a great subject matter and topic and he stated he may be one of the few people to have written a book on this narrow topic for a lay person, but the book lacks a professional polished work; take it for what you can get out of it and question things 
 This book should never have been put together.  Many of the works are butchered.  Sometimes not even the original title is included and it seems that authors are missing from several as well.  He even butchers Aesops fables -- guess he doesn't want to overtax young minds with the full versions in all their splendor.  Of course, many of the selections are classics, but what he's edited out leaves me not only cold but disgusted.  If your kids internallize some of the slop used to demonstate these virtues, it will be hard to erase a number of pernitious misconceptions later 
 There are many great ideas presented in this book about dealing with your add child, BUT the chapter on meds is completely off base.  Let me preface the following with MY opinion (I am not an MD or an expert) that children with ADD need a team approach in helping them deal with the condition (if you choose to call it one) and there is a place for meds for many kids, BUT it is only a piece of the puzzle. Parents, teachers, family members, Md's, and behavioral specialists are all crucial. I happen to work indirectly with many of the world thought leaders and experts on ADD (ie. Joseph Beiderman, Mass General Hospital, Boston MA/ Harvard Medical School, ... look up his credentials). First Dr. Frank Lawlis is not an MD, this means he has not been to medical school- that is not to say he isn't a great psychologist, just that he HAS NOT and DOES NOT write prescriptions for these meds and has NO first hand experience with directly managing these meds himself.  In this book there are many things that are completely false regarding ADD meds. For example he states that they only work for about 50% of kids.  FALSE Let me cite 3 credible sources that disputes this (notice in the book that he does not talk about HIS credible source)  1. "approx 70% of patients respond to the first stimulant agent administered with resulting improvement in their ADHD symptoms." - Practical Considerations in Stimulant Drug Selection for the ADHD Patient- Efficacy, Potency and Titration Beiderman, Today's Therapeutic Trends, 02'  2. "Improvement occurred in 65-75% of 5,899 patients randomized to stimulants." - Practice Parameter for the Use of Stimulant Medication in the Treatment of Children, Adolescents, and Adults, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Feb02'  3. "At least 80% of children will respond to one of the stimulants if they are tried in a systemic way." Clinical Practice Guideline: Treatment of the School-Aged Child with ADHD, Published in American Acedemy of Pediatrics, Oct 01'.   All of these quotes are credible and are opinions based on evidence-based medicine from the experts. Lawlis also states that there has been little research in children and that most studies have been done on adults and rats/mice.  This is Completely False! The Journal noted above, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry  (that was a review of  "161 randomized controlled trials that have been published encompassing 5 preschool, 150 school-age, 7 Adolescent, and 9 adult studies"  Where does Dr. Lawlis get his information?  The review noted above by the American Acedemy of Pediatrics, identified for analysis 2405 citations, 92 reports, and 78 different studies.  This is American Acedemy of Pediatrics- They are only interested in children and adolescents! Not Rats, Mice, and Adults.   These are the most credible Medical Journals published. These are not the biased trials sponsored by big pharma.  The information in these Journals is taken very seriously by Pediatricians and Child Psychiatrists, and is heavily relied upon by these professionals.   Lastly, he also states that these drugs are identical to cocaine in their affect on the brain. This is not true, they have similarities, but by NO-Means identical.  Yes it is true that stimulant medications can be abused and can also be addictive, but some of the newer formulations of these meds have lessened their abuse and addictive potential by altering the speed at which the drug is released into the bloodstream thereby somewhat flattening the curve (Cocaine use produces a curve that is almost straight up-this is what gives the "high") The most common way for these drugs to be abused is by crushing them and snorting them (which allows for fast absorption and steep curve), and some of the newer meds are crush resistant and/or cannot be turned into a fine enough substance to be snorted.  There has also been data published that shows a DECREASE not increase in drug abuse for patients who have taken stimulants.  It is believed that kids who are treated (drug treatment and otherwise) are less likely to associate with kids who are failing academically/socially and who are more likely to be using drugs. (This is not to say that high all high achievers abstain from using OR that ALL children who are failing ARE using)  It is just a point that kids who are treated are more likely to be focused on school and their responsibilities and are less likely to be involved in drug use.   Kids who are failing in school academically/socially are often looked at as outcasts and are often looked down upon by peers, teachers, and family, and this can cause a child to look for an escape... sometimes drugs.  Children who Do benefit from stimulant medication sometimes have more self-esteem because of their success, and certainly less scrutiny from peers, teachers etc.    Lastly, Lawlis tells a story about a man who died from long-term stimulant medication.  I am not going to say that this did not happen, but I will say that stimulants have been used since the 1950's, and the medical community agrees that they are safe when managed properly.  The medical community and FDA have pulled MANY medications that were deemed unsafe from the markets (many times against the will of BIG Pharma) and the stimulants would not have remained on the market for OVER 50 YEARS, if stories like this were common or the least bit likely.    I am not at all stating that stimulant meds are the answer because they are not, but they can be a small piece of the puzzle that is helping these kids with ADD.  The book is full of great ideas and approaches to ADD, but he is not accurate about the stimulant medications.  Parents who see value in them should not feel ashamed and or frightened by what he says because most of it is just not accurate.  Good luck and I hope this was helpful.    
 I have little to add to what's already been said by other reviewers other than I can't believe she seriously holds these views.  I admit that I only read parts of the book while at the bookstore, but no one who is educated, and I presume she is, can really think that evolution is unproven.  You might as well say that the Earth is flat, or square, or whatever.  She writes this drivel because it targets the far-right and gives them what they want.  Apparently this works because she churns out this trash about once a year 
 I wish I would have read these reviews before purchasing this movie.  I cosign with everything everyone else is saying.  I too remember what this movie was like when it first aired.  Not only have the scenes been edited or deleted but the order of some scenes were altered as well.  I love this movie but I am disappointed in this dvd.  The dvd is supposed to have added features, not features taken away.  I should have known it was too good to be true, it was only $7.50!!  If it isn't broken.........ya'll know the rest 
 After reading all the 5 star reviews for this book, I guess I was expecting more than what was delivered.  Most of what the author brings to light is not new.  There have been dozens if not hundreds of books describing out-of-body experiences, the Hall of Records, auras, the Astral plane, etc. This book does offer a slightly different perspective though, in that we experience these things through the eyes of a young girl.  Yet, when someone says that they have met with Jesus, it sets off my "b.s." meter.  What did Jesus have to say to the author?  Well, here again, nothing new.  He quoted from the Bible and He said things like "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and His righteousness..".  And how does the 7 year old respond?  Like no 7 year old I have ever met. She kisses the feet of Jesus, at which time she hears "the angels singing about the blood of the lamb". Huh? How does the blood of the lamb fit in with astral travel? The author seems torn between her Baptist upbringing and her more unorthodox spiritual experiences.  The result is a confusing mix of beliefs that may leave readers scratching their heads 
 I'm always amazed about people who study the Bible in order to find there errors. They have a lot to say, but it is vanity of vanities. If somebody cares about this topic, try to find "Forever Settled" by Jack Moorman. ISBN 1888328061 
 My husband bought me this for my Birthday.  I suppose it was supposed to be romantic, but it about put me to sleep and definitely out of the mood.  I am not into the swing band era.  Perhaps being born in the seventy's puts me at a disadvantage for appreciating this type of music 
 I rarely ever fail to complete a book I've paid for but after about sixty pages of Edward Klein's docudrama I don't know if I'll be finishing.  Instead of a historical summary about Hillary Clinton's life and policies, Klein elected to open with a series of tenuously credible accounts from interns who witnessed marital strife between her and Bill, accusations that she's a secret lesbian and obvious observations such as criticism of her seemingly inborn political nature. I didn't see the makings of any ruminations on the real reasons to question the merits of Mrs. Clinton's candidacy (i.e blatant nepotism in federal government, her relative lack of charisma to inspire the masses,  the failure of the first Clinton administration in response to the USS Cole bombing etc.)Instead Klein seems content, at least in intoductary chapters, to make glib carpet muncher referances about Mrs. Clinton his thesis for why she would make a bad president.  The minimum price of this book is skyrocketing upwards of twenty dollars.  If you don't like money then buy it. 
 This book, and its discription, lead you to believe that you will discover secrets about the series; that you'll learn about the allusions in the series; and basically that it is the ultimate commonplace book to go refer to.  It is wrong.  It is filled with useless facts that you could find on google if you looked for 5 minutes.  I grew bored with it in 15 minutes and put it down.  All it is filled with, is facts semi-related to the series (for instance, it talks about the creatures in montys reptile room, and other REAL reptiles).  This doesn't explain anything new or interesting about the series, and you feel like you're reading an encyclopedia.  The author tries way to hard to be funny, and comes off as an annoying toddler trying to get your attention with a stupid toy that you dont care about.  At least read a few pages before you buy/rent it.    BE WARNED 
 Ayn Rand's fictional story about "when the engine of the world stopped" is rather poorly written. The philosophical perspective presented in some of the speeches and some of the events in this overly long story is individualism that knows no restraint. I got the feeling while reading this book that there was no such thing as society, no such thing as kindness or compassion. In fact it seemed like compassion and kindness were moral faults to be sneered at. Anyway, the story was second rate at best and kind of horrifying at worst.  Judging the literary quality of a book may be a matter of taste, however I am not alone in considering the book to be poorly written. The specific areas where it is wanting in quality are there: (1) The characters are poorly developed and seem to exist mainly to advance the philosophical agenda of the author. (2) the situations and conversations presented in the story lack credibility. What person have you ever met who launches into a 4 or 5 page philosophical presentation while courting or love making?  (3) the 'bad' characters are 'bad' mostly because they think that social responsibility and compassion matter. Somehow compassion is a vice that the author distorts until it cannot be recognised. Such departures from real life experience that we all share really degrades the story line into parody - again this is done to advance the philosophical agenda of the author. The parody is not intentional it is merely the product of poor composition (4) the story is at time interminably verbose. What could be said in a few lines is stretched out into tedious pages by the author because she had an inadequate ability to write in the English language. Verbosity does not clarify and it does not improve a story line.  I am sure that this book appeals mainly to people in their later teens - before they gained enough life experience and enough good sense to reject the stupidity that the author seems to think is a virtue 
 This is a very short book that summarizes the plot of Taxi Driver. The author adds a handful of ideas along the way, ranging from the obvious (Travis Bickle is a borderline personality) to the questionable (when buying guns, he's choosing from a wide range of penises). It helps that the author is a woman. Her take on the violence and sexuality of the story is slightly different from the other (male) reviews I have read. However, there's so little here that is new, it's not worth buying. This would be better as a chapter in a larger book 
 I didn't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated! I figured it out, sort of, but to this day when I push the diaper in the film rips. Then when it comes time to change the film, the top doesn't cut the film so I have to use scissors. My sister-in-law told me to register for it. Why did I listen to her! Don't buy it! Dont register for it! It's not worth it! I want a refund 
 Have two of these printers. Both began creasing the center of paper after a short period of use. Creases got worse and they started to jam. Went to Brother online tech support. Was told to use other paper. Emailed back that I used high quality paper but was told that was the cause. Not so. This seems to be a common problem with this printer and Brother will not acknowledge. Past Brother printers work great. Not sure I will try another Brother 
 I am a huge Vonnegut fan. I have read them all. This was one of the last that I read, and by far my least favorite. I barely got through it. DO NOT start reading Vonnegut with this book. Start with Slaughterhouse Five or something else, and save Cat's Cradle for last.... 
 Given the tremendous sum of money that this series of novels has garnered, prior to its adaptation to the big screen, this movie is a dismal failure and a testament to the sacrifice of quality in favor of fiscal stinginess.  There is no excuse for providing a loyal fan base with a cheap B-grade level, not-quite-good-enough-for-prime-time hack job, however Cloud Ten Productions has managed to hash out 95 minutes of visual drivel that even a low-budget Third World airline wouldn't bother scheduling on their red-eye flights.  The Internet Movie Database offers this bit of insight into the "artistry" of Paul Lalonde who is the "creative" (*gag!*) half of the "fabulous" Lalonde brothers, founders of Cloud Ten: "With two degrees in psychology, Paul is able to apply his knowledge of the human psyche to the characters in his movies."  One would expect that this level of academic acumen might justify having a better sense of casting for a movie than settling for the likes of Kurt Cameron, Janaya Stephens, and host of others that usually wind up as the expendable extras who are sliced and diced in a cheesy horror film.  Cameron is one of the most over-rated thespians I've ever seen and given the pathetic display of his craft here I am proud to say that I have never seen an episode of "Growing Pains".  Brad Johnson and Clarence Gilyard are the only surviving hope for this sleeping-pill-on-celluloid and it's tragic that their talent is wasted and that they are surrounded by untalented no-names who can't act themselves out of a wet paper bag.  A Canadian to play Carpathia?  Am I to be convinced that they couldn't find a European actor with a better accent than this DeNiro wanna-be?  Any serious scholar of eschatology knows that the AntiChrist will arise out of the resurrected Roman Empire and there should have been an effort to find an actor to the task.  The whole production is a farce, the majority of which was shot in Canada (now there's convincing on-location environment for you) and shows no initiative of capturing the feel for the Holy Land.  Having seen multiple films that have been filmed in the Middle East, this gets the "Let's Just Throw It Together And Forget About Authenticity Because We Assume Our Viewing Audience Are Morons Without A Clue" award. The lousy special effects further rob this film of any credibility.  The apocalyptic theme demands visual effects that should be inferior to none.  After all, the intent here is to show the end of this world and provide visual shock-and-awe.  It is more schlock-and-yawn and, like the song "It's the End of the World as We Know It" by the ending credits I still feel fine.  Sadly, this is a testament to what happens when a production company is chosen because of its claims to being a Christian film company, not based upon its ability to deliver quality. Words fail me to pen my disappointment with this whole "Left Behind" film escapade.  I would sooner  recommend the End Times thrillers "The Omega Code" and its sequel "Omega Code II: Armageddon" for more mystery, action, intrigue, and one heck of a more enjoyable viewing experience 
 This coat was listed as camel, but when it arrived it was actually tan.  Even the tag says tan.  I was disappointed because it was the only Christmas gift that I had for my husband.  I never would have ordered a tan.  Also the coat fit like a whole size larger.  I had to return it and it has been well over a month and I still have not received my refund 
 Just an average book on landscape photography. Not much on technical aspects but lots of nice photos to look at. If you want to learn something about taking landscape photos, don't bother with this book 
 Tried very hard to get through this book, but in the end gave up.  Don't need a paragraph to describe a blade of grass.  Put me to sleep 
 As an avid fan of Hamilton and other great sci-fi writers, I find it difficult to plow my way through Benford's mess. The story idea is good, but Benford's writing is positively awful. At times he can't even seem to make up his mind what tense he's writing in. Initial charater development is next to nonexistent, and following character dialogue is somewhat akin to finding one's way around a corn maze at midnight. He uses what seems to be an alsmost experimental approach to dialogue, and no two are formatted the same. Sentence structure is immature and disjointed. Its either incredibly simple, or so complicated it becomes difficult to follow. Some character situations are wildly implausible even for sci-fi, or underdeveloped to the point that they seem so. I would not recommend this book. I am no writer, but I can recognize great writing and this isn't it 
 I reviewed this book for some colleagues.  This is what I have to offer:  If you like throwing money out, buy this book.  If you are curious, pick it up at a library before you decide to indulge. This is a miserable self-proclaimed self-help guru who needs serious therapy 
 The majority of this book is empty exposition.  People move about meaningless lives without purpose.  The "protagonist" merely drifts through a life which offers him a potential to engage at every turn, which he either doesn't recognize, actively avoids.  When he IS finally forced to take action, the plot is cliche, but you figure, you hope, you PRAY that it will be redeemed by something in the end.  Meanwhile you've got an antagonist that was lifted almost directly from The Karate Kid.  The "twist" ending never validates a single one of the pages you've wasted your life reading, and ultimately adds up to a useless stack of paper with no soul or meaning.  True Story: The moment I finished reading this book, I stood up, strolled across the lunchroom, and threw it into the garbage can, so no one would ever need waste brain cells on its pages again.  I hate Ransom like I hate Illinois Nazis.  Read ANYTHING else 
 Leonard Bernstein was indeed a great exponent of Mahler's music, especially during the sixties. But, I am sad to say, he was not always its best interpreter. Bernstein's presentations of Mahler are often big and bold - or, in other words, overloaded - and occasionally he even adds instrumental effects just to make the music to sound even more swollen (consider, for example, the addition of a bass drum stroke in the ultimate chord of symphony no. 1). Passages that require sophistication are often underlined with broad, syrup-sentimental strokes. This is especially the case with these late Mahler recordings, which Bernstein made for DG.   In some people's taste, this is just wonderful. They want showpieces and nothing else. But other people might have other intuitions regarding Mahler's music. For example, they want orchestral balance and not too deliberate takes.   Now this DG set is incredibly expensive - $191! My advice, if you want a set with Bernstein's Mahler, is to look for the set with his earlier recordings for CBS/SONY. You get it for a third of the price ($ 63), and the interpretations are usually far better in all respects (with the exception of No. 5).   But if you just want the best box with the complete symphonies of Gustav Mahler, I would recommend Rafael Kubelik's set (DG collectors series) as the first choice. Kubelik's interpretations are far more balanced and presented without mannerism, and, overall, his set is more consistent than any of Bernstein's. For reference, you could then add the selected gems of Bernstein's early Mahler recordings: Nos. 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.  Thus I give two stars for this DG set, three stars for the earlier CBS/SONY set, and four stars for Kubelik's set. 
  A great topic, credible contributors, plus an eye-popping cover all led me to believe this was a "must have". After an hour of UNDERSTANDING I realized this was a hoax.  UNDERSTANDING fails as a design reference and data resource both: some designs are more complex than the data they're communicating; layouts and print quality are often so poor they render the information unreadable; errors of all kinds riddle the pages, from typos to missing digits to transposed characters to uncited sources.   You'd think a bunch of people (who are) invested in design would be sticklers for clarity, accuracy and quality; UNDERSTANDING proves otherwise.   If you agree that good design facilitates understanding, look elsewhere. Edward Tufte, Nigel Holmes, Alan MacEachren and Robert Harris come to mind.. 
 I was motivated to write this review (my first) because the last chapter was so bad.  The last chapter didn't flow with the rest of the book or itself.  I thought I may have slept through parts of the book, so I started to re-read it.  No, I handn't slept while reading.  I couldn't finish re-reading because, like the first time, I got tired of the rambling and griping.  In this final chapter, the author missed the obvious.  He was the problem and would have been forced to leave regardless of national and organizational leadership.  
 The title of the book is attractive. That's why I purchased a copy.  Other than that, the book could be easily summarized on one page with a couple good suggestions.  Otherwise, it feels like a con-job, and a waste of money 
 Me encanta Perales como compositor y por esto compre este disco pero los nuevos arreglos de sus exitos son basicos y malos. Su primera cancion "Porque te vas" no tiene casi instrumentos y pues a decir verdad su voz no es que sea de las mas bonitas, Parecia mi abuelito cantando. Adoro a Perales pero esta recopilacion es una perdedera de dinero 
 This book could be so much better if it contained *accurate* information about all the animals mentioned!  Conway needs to do adequate research before writing, and Llewellyn needs to do their editorial homework before publishing her books 
 Charles Bukowski is a writer.  He's not the type to go to writers clubs, instead he drank, as most good writers do - and a lot of bad ones I suppose.  He's dead now, so it's ok to like him.  I was making my way through the lot of his novels - his Novels because I hate poetry -  `Postal Service' is his best so far. What negated `Ham on Rye' in my opinion was his EMPHASIS on just how hard his life was as a child growing up in a loveless household.  Bukowski is a person who values the idea of individualism.  It is hard for me to fully respect a man who calls himself an individual and a `tough guy,' who so obviously blames his parents for his attitude towards the world.  Directly after this book I read Celine's `Death on the Installment Plan,' an author recommended by Bukowski as being one of his consistent favorites.  I can understand that, because Celine's childhood was much the same; poor, loveless, solitary - in short a joy to read.  Of course `Ham on Rye' is well written, you get a very strong sense of voice and tone from all of his books.  He's one of the few authors that are fun to read aloud to yourself because there's a definite beat and rhythm to his narrative process.  Not a bad book, on the grand scheme, but it showed me a side of this man who lived a `hard' life, who takes the easy way out and blames his childhood for being the character that he is. 
 I remember when I was first introduced to the "Cat Who" mysteries; my High School French teacher's bookshelf was full of them, along with the Mrs. Polifax mysteries and some Inspector Maigret. I enjoyed them, even though they were a little cutesy and it was hard to suspend disbelief at the cats' antics, but I wasn't really driven to keep up with the series.  Now, seeing the book in a cheap pile at Wal-Mart, I figured why not try it--and wow, what a disappointment. It seems to me that the "Cat Who" mysteries actually used to be mysteries, but judging by this one, now they're just cutesy.  It's a sad state of affairs when the blurb of a book is more exciting than the actual book itself. Talked Turkey's blurb implies Qwilleran has to solve an execution-style murder on his property, and somehow the mysterious reappearance of wild turkeys thought long-gone from the area has something to do with it. Well, it doesn't (nor is it ever explained at all, in fact), and the murder is barely even mentioned in the book; the fact that it gets "solved" in the end is more or less coincidental. In actuality, the book is by and large a slice-of-life story about Qwilleran, his cats, and the community. Which is fine if that's the sort of thing you're looking for, but not all that great when the book is being advertised as a "mystery. 
 it is a good toy but the balls are rather small and youmust check the seams when they arrive for poor sowin 
 I didn't like this album that much. Only songs i liked are The MC, Step Into A World, A Friend, Can't Stop Won't Stop. Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i don't know why he tried to do a rock song. Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS. The songs were too short on this album also. 
 It's almost laughable. In a book based on stressing the importance of not holding prejudices, the author's characterizations are full of them. Note how he falls back on biased notions to draw the characters of the ex-cop and the Republican stay-at-home mother. There are no shades of gray for them at all. The whole book lacks depth and the reader walks away with nothing to ponder. I'm no prude, but it's funny how the only characters the author puts upon a pedestal are the child molester and the adulterers. No wonder Hollywood is making this trash into a movie. 
 Let's consider 'Why Not Me' a trial run for Al Franken's better written follow-up 'Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.'  All of Franken's work bears the hallmarks of his sketch comedy background - it's an ensemble of pieces, some of which work, some of which don't.  In 'Lies,' roughly 80% or more of the pieces hit the mark (I wasn't a fan of the cartoons).  In 'Why Not Me,' it's about 50%.  Like the Bob Woodward parody ('The Void'), for example: funny for about the first five pages (you laugh when you see Franken's nailed Woodward's melodramatic scene-setting and habit of assembling conversations as if he were in the room).  But it drags on and on.  How many readers got though the whole piece?  Not many I bet.  Like others, I agree that the campaign diary worked the best, followed closely by the faux Newsweek piece - the classic campaign shot of Franken chopping wood with Golden Retriever at his side is a howler.  Talk about spot-on.  I think the best part of the entire book is the 'one issue' campaign (elimination of ATM Fees) and how Candidate Franken steers all discussion back to that point.  Watching both Bush and Kerry try to route every question back to stump speech set pieces makes you realize that there's sometimes a fine line between parody and reality.   
 Firstly, I would warn self-publishers that this book is not intended for you. This book is a guide to working WITH a publicist. If you can afford such an expense then proceed to purchase, but most self-publishers are not in that boat (yacht).  Secondly, I took issue with the author's promotion of manipulating Amazon feedback through recruiting as many friends and family as possible to give 5 star reviews. It is because of this abuse of Amazon feedback that I gloss over the positive feed back and read the one and two star reviews to get to the ugly truth. Sometimes these low ratings are baseless; most times they are credible critiques.  Lastly, if you want to get an idea for the REAL value of a non-fiction book, take a gander at the number of USED copies available and the lowest asking price. If published within the last 5 years and still relevant to its topic, a truly valuable book tends to stay within $3 to $5 of the Amazon price and if recently published, won't have an excessive amount of used books available. A better alternative to this book (that would be valuable to self-published and traditionally published alike) is The Complete Guide to Book Marketing by David Cole 
 I agree with many of the other reviewers that this book is well written. However, I would not call it a good book. The life of the main character, Rosa, is caught in a downward spiral until she reaches rock bottom and discovers that, in the end, she will always be alone, because everyone she cares about or loves will leave her or die. This is the MOST depressing book I've ever read. If you are clinically depressed or have ever had suicidal thoughts, you should stay away from this book. (This last comment is not intended for shock value -- I truly feel this way after reading the book. 
 Ordered this product without reading other reviews first.  Wish I had because these ladies are dead on.  The dryer cuts off as soon as it starts to get hot.  Don't waste your time or money.  It's Saturday.  My hair is wet and set, and I'm left without a dryer.  I've tried three times: twice on high and once on medium setting.  I'm sending this back right away.  Amazon don't let Conair blame this on you.  This model is DEFECTIVE 
 I originally picked up the book because I recently read a book by Katzenbach and absolutely loved it!  I would rate it (A Madman's Tale)as one of my all time favorites, so it is obvious to see why I would pick another that he had taken part in.  But if not for the proceeds going to the Nature Conservancy I would find it not just a waste of time but also money.  And unfortunately it has me not very interested in searching out any of the other authors books.  Great concept - dreadful outcome 
 Although The flatware is nice looking... I bought these because they claimed it was 18/10 stainless steel, what I received was 18/0. Be aware 
 Maybe "bad" is a bit harsh. David Nassar is a real and successful trader, and a guy who has years and years of experience training and managing highly successful traders to boot. He writes great articles for Active Trader and Futures magazines, and has written another book that I consider to be five-star outstanding.  But this book is disappointingly basic. It focuses on the mechanics of how trading is done and gives very little, if any, actual trading methodologies. A quick look at the table of contents and you will get the overview. It seemed to me like half the book was discussing how an order is placed!  Perhaps part of the problem is being outdated. Deciding how to route an order these days is a very insignificant factor in daytrading; the days of the SOES bandits are long, long gone. Broker's trading platforms now use smart routing technologies to get the best fill, and as a sharp trader you are using limit orders on stocks that have a 1 cent spread anyway. I suppose this was written back when you could take advantage of price differences between ECNs and Market Makers.  Your time is much better spent reading his other book, Rules of the Trade, where you can actually learn a few things and become inspired.  [... 
 What a self-centered, judgemental load of horse hockey this book is.  This guy thinks he should be the arbitor of decency?  "But why shouldn't he?" you ask.  1. Miller rants about John Kerry voting to cut military spending after the end of The Cold War, even though he voted to cut it, too.  2. He claims Democrats want more immigration, although it's George W. who called for a "guest worker" program, Reagan who granted an immigration amnesty, and right wing corporations that push to keep immigrant workers here so that wages will stay low.  3. He blames homosexuals for weakening the American family, yet says nothing about Republicans weakening middle class families by quashing increases to the minimum wage, which forces parents to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet.  (And how many divorces have YOU seen because of homosexuals?  Statistically, it's most often about either money - as noted above - or too much HETEROsexual activity outside the marriage by one of the spouses.)  4. He decries the increasing lack of decency in how politicians treat one another, yet backstabs his own party members and has no complaints at all about Saxby Chambliss falsely accusing veteran, war hero, and multiple amputee (due to war wounds) Max Cleland of supporting al-Qaeda.  This guy wouldn't know decency if he shot it in a duel.  I could keep going, but by now you either get it or you're a right winger.  And given what Washington's current right wingers consider decent  -- protecting Republican pedaphiles for political gain, widespread Abramoff bribes, money laundering, Terri Schiavo interference, warrantless wiretaps, coupling tax breaks for the very rich with cuts to elderly programs, a lie-based war, etc. -- I can only recommend this book to you as a source of ironic hypocracy 
 This book has an overview of diseases for most domestic large animals.  I found this text to be too general to be very helpful as a reference guide for folks needing all the details.  It does have some decent rule out lists.  
 This is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in "The Hideaway" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.  The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.  I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.  The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).  This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.  Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one.  Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts

 Twice, we have attempted to purchase the 11 inch Swiss Diamond 6428C fry pan with lid from Amazon and had to return each upon delivery.  The pans are shipped from the factory in boxes that are too small and during shipment the knobs on the lid break.  The knobs are made of a brittle plastic and the lids simply are not packed with enough cushioning.  These may be good pans but unfortunately have very poor packaging.

 When the annals of Jewish self-hate are codified, Finkelstein will stand as a major contributor to the world of self-abuse by hallucinatory wingnuts.

 This is a very expensive set.  Personally I didn't think it was worth it.  Very hard to follow instructions with very small, easy to lose pieces.  Way too difficult for small children to put together.  Once together it was fun too play with but still not worth the money 
 I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting.  They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues).  At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours.  Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere 
 just to make the plot work.  Not very realistic.  If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. 
 My friend and I watched this movie together and both agreed on one thing, Naveen Andrews looks very good with long hair. We were both so depressed by the end we wanted to weep!(and NOT in an oh my gosh that was good kind of way) The movie is well made and the filming is beautiful, but all the great scenery in the world can not overcome one of the most depressing sorylines ever. This movie makes Titanic seem cheerful! My friend summed it up with saying "obviously you shouldn't go and cheat with somebody's wife or you will end up with a burnt face or writing letters in a cave". She followed this comment by saying, "I think I'm gonna go home now and cry". Well I have to say on this one I agree with her. For those of you that love this film, more power to ya, it's all yours 
 First, I can not hide the fact that the author  put a valuable effort in this book, it is a good  book but still I have some criticism. like every  book when it deals with straight forward things,  it gives u full details but when it comes to real  stuff starts summarizing stuff. I can understand  this since the book talks about so many topics  however the main disadvantage of this book is that it did not succeed in giving the reader a good understanding on how is the code provided interacts with the engine. I do not know, I can not word it well but the key point as u proceed reading the book u feel like it is easy going but when u reach the real meat you start feeling that the writer started to rush. I have no problem with just summaries but what is important is the context, when u talk about the engine and scripts, u need to explain what the hell are these classes and call back functions that are just copied to this book. 
 I found the layout and presentation  of the book difficult to follow and could not easily see the principles behind the so called technique. It really didn't seem any different than talk therapy to me 
 This book is written relatively well.  But, as other reviewers points out, if you really want to understand the arguments, then you had better realize Eugenie Scott is a staunch defender evolution and always has been.  In other words, there is no way she could have, and did not, write a balanced treatment of the debate at all.  It's balanced for evolutionists, to be sure, not for anyone else and obviously not for me.  I am still waiting for anyone, anyone at all, to go into enough detail about the fossil record (there are a number of possibilities here) to actually prove that there are enough fossils, that the dating of them was accurate, there was no 'fudging', and many more details about the fossils themselves and the techniques used to analyze them - to show that evolution is a fact.  If, for example, we somehow fossilized 100 different birds that are alive today, some related and some not, I have a feeling that evolution would still be prescribed as the cause for the different species, that different dates would be assigned for each species based on what type of rock it was found (even though it has nothing to do with anything in this case), etc.  The negative reviews of those who critize this book are based purely on emotion.  None of them involve science, which is supposedly what evolution is based on.  If anyone can tell me how specific traits of evolution are testable, such as the 'fact' that life began from inanimate matter, or that species evolved into separate species, I would love to hear it.  Please be specific and let me know how you know based on your five senses, and not that there's a magical theory that explains it, because just as creationism explains everything - so does evolution.  Both are not true.  I am truly amazed that Amazon.com doesn't delete most of the 'reviews' because they are nothing but a bunch of cheap shots at the other side 
 This is basiclly an album that sounds like a acid trip    Even weirder then Zappa. and thats saying somethin 
 It's hard to know where to begin when talking about this sensationalistic tabloid-like book.  On the one hand, not everything is a lie, exaggeration, urban legend, or told in a gleefully sensationalistic manner, and there are good pictures, but those aspects are really overwhelmed by how much of the book just isn't true.  It's uncertain just what propelled Kenneth Anger (who has a very fitting surname) to write this book; was it the fact he was bitter that his own Hollywood career never came to anything much, a general dislike of most of the stars from Hollywood's Golden Age, a love of sensational gossip in general, or something else?  He's a writer of the same caliber as an Albert Goldman or Geoffrey Giuliano and their own celebrity biographies--it's been shown that most of what they've written just isn't true and has no basis in factual evidence and has never been proven, so you have to doubt everything they write, even if some passages are true or written in a respectful manner.  He's like the boy who cried wolf.  Although amazingly quite a few people believe all of the stories in this book and they're now regularly discussed like they actually happened and are absolute fact, even though they're the results of speculation, urban legends that have been disproven yet just won't go away because of books like this, and are outright lies and character assassinations.  Just because I'm a fan of many of the celebrities from Old Hollywood doesn't mean I'm incapable of accepting that some of them did have less than perfect lives, personal scandals, and were the complete opposite of their screen personalities.  But by and large, with certain exceptions, the stars of that era were classy, keeping their personal and private lives separate.  Even if they did have, say, problems with alcohol, sleeping around, or drug abuse, they still presented positive public images and role models of class, grace, and style.  It wasn't like today, when people seem to know just about every detail of a celebrity's private life.  Does Anger somehow feel that celebrities of yore were more prone to scandal and devastating problems?  And why does anyone want to know some of these sleazy details, like about someone dying on the toilet?  Are we supposed to suddenly no longer like this person's body of work?  Even some celebrity biographies that do report events of this nature at least balance it out with just as much positive information and a respectful tone, instead of taking delight in tearing down reputations.  It would seem baffling as to why people now take some of these stories as accepted facts, no matter how many times they've been disproven, but again, it seems to be human nature to believe the bad and not the good.  
 If we are to believe Blair, an ex USN submariner, that the KM was not what it was said to be, that it never came close to strangling trans Atlantic trade, that its sinklings were vastly inflated, that the U boats made hardly an impact in the waters off America and the Carribean, that its officers and sailors were mostly cowardly incompetents,then the question must be asked, why were so much resources put into defeating them? And why was he writing 2 massive books on them? Could he be jealous of the fact that the public is fascinated and mesmerized by the U boats, while the USN submarine service has been accorded much less attention, not to  mention adulation, despite its proven successes against Jap shipping 
 Her work is unreadable.  It's too bad she abandoned what she had accomplished with Erosion so many years ago.  She is good at convincing people of her importance and so no one will tell the truth about her work.  If someone does, that person risks being thought of as a bad reader.  But there is nothing to nourish the soul in her poems. Nothing to contemplate.  They are not even interesting technically. The passionate defenses she generates always make me think of "protesting too much."  Her work is like reading impenetrable critical essays.  And even critical essays can be written for pleasurable reading, with ease and style.  American poetry has gone down a wrong road by following her example

 "The Cherry Orchard" is an atrocious play.  If we hold this play in high regard, then we dramatist's need to reevaluate our standards.  Chekhov wrote a play that will make you not care an inch about the character's or their situation(s).  For him to think that this is a comedy makes you wonder if he understood the point he himself was trying to make.  The characters are pathetic and they'll make you pity them - not because of their predicaments, but because of whom they are.  I do not recommend 
 I am a fan of Feehan but on this latest book I haven't even finished it yet. Between the sex and the violence it went beyond a little thrilling to just trash.

 Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45 
  I was pleased at the methods used to train your dogs from puppy to mature dogs.  IT covers several different styles of training, clicker and others. I would highly recommend it as a excellent resource in your inventory of training methods.  I am using it on my 9 week old rat terrier and he will fetch, come sit and down with a little help and yes even shake hands 
 I keep running into Booksellers, Book Collectors saying "But McBride's Books Say". Please take all and any information with a grain of salt, when some of the information are just what others are saying. There are mistakes with all EXPERTS, remember the Earth is round not flat. Do research of your own, most(99.5%) of the correct information is available for free, the rest is theory. Keep that in mind 
 I had trouble concentrating while reading this book. Although I usually like to finish the books I start, I couldn't finish this one, and got While I was reading, I kept thinking, is there a point to all of this? It took me 400 pages before I realized that there wasn't really a point to al of Ackroyd's ramblings.  Ackroyd takes you on a tour of London in this mammoth book. The subtitle is "a biography," but it should read "a biography of London's poor in the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries." What bothered me the most was the fact that Ackroyd didn't do things chronologically. He'd talk about, for example, the coffee houses that proliferated in London in the eighteenth century, then go backward in time and talk about the Great Fire of 1666. He also gives the reader little bits and pieces of history--ie, the history of a particular area of London, or the history of the Cockney accent.   Absolutely no attention was paid to the bigger picture. Who were the major historical figures of London? What about the buildings themselves? In addition, Ackroyd pays scant attention to everything that happened before the Civil War. Sure, there's a chapter at the beginning, but its not much, considering the size and heft of this book.   I was disappointed in this book because I'd expected so much more. I'd really enjoyed his biographies on Dickens and Shakespeare and had thought that I'd like London: A Biography as well. Oh, well. You can't have everything. 
 I read this book in order to see if it would change my opinion about the status of social security. It does not. In fact, it glosses over the key, overriding issue: that the so-called "social security trust fund" does not in fact exist. The claim that huge surpluses are being mounted is meaningless when all that really exists is an IOU that the government writes to itself.   The book spends all of one paragraph (see page 28) on this critical issue, suggesting that the reader imagine that the fund is invested in private stocks and bonds, rather than government bonds, and concluding, "It is difficult to see why the composition of the trust fund's portfolio should make any difference." I just about threw the book across the room at that point! In other words, the authors see no difference between a fund backed by real assets that can simply be sold and a fund that will require raising taxes or additional borrowing on an enormous scale 
 I have the same problem as the others. It only works upside down. It only works outside. It chugs about inside. It works great in the Disney store. When you get it home. It is a huge dissapointment 
 I have bought this book in order to find a usfull guide in sleight of hand...instead I have gotten a lot of unusfull text with ONLY 57 illustration.  Think twise before bying this book 
 We made the mistake of buying this ABRIDGED version of The Hundred Days, not noticing the FINE PRINT. The reader was very good, but the material truncated, choppy, and not "up to snuff." If you are a devoted fan of the Aubrey-Maturin stories, hurry up and read, yes, read the book. There's not a moment to lose 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 First off, when I recieved the book there was a cigarette hole burned on one of the pages. (Nice one!) Right out of the package.  Then when I opened it, I realized that all the claims that the book is based around are pretty far fetched and really cannot be substantiated.  Every time the Bible used the words like: Evil Ones, Sinner, Wicked, etc. aren't really talking about people, but fallen angels....ummm...what?!    Supposedly John the Baptist refuted these angels in the gospels by saying, "You brood of Vipers!"  Umm...it doesn't take a rocket scientist to prove that in the sentence before (or the current one) says that he's talking with the Pharisees and Saduccees.  The Bible is very clear on that point and I'm not sure what the writer was thinking.    Too much conjecture, and false analogies in my opinion.  I'm really sorry I bought this book.  I wished whoever burned the one page burned the rest of it too 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I, guess, as a musician I was hoping for more emphasis on music and not twelve pages on bathing, showering, shaving, putting on underwear...well, you get the idea.  It's the first Reading Rainbow book I have not liked at all.  I had planned to give this to a friend's children but I defintely will not 
 Wow..What lies.  I NEVER hear any kind of news channel favor the left...NEVER.  The media, especially FOX News, has a right wing bias..its 100% FACT, proven beyond any reasonable doubt.  The republican right wing NUT JOB Wackos INVENTED the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage, and its simply not true.  Republicans are the worst thing that could ever happen to this country, all they know how to do is lie, cheat, steal, and profit off of the suffering of others.  Oh yeah, and these religious wing nuts are delusional bigots who think some guy waved a magic wand and invented the universe.  Give me a break.  This book is 100% lies.  I actually burned the book after I read it...(Notice the lack of credible sources).  Good job republicans...Continue to make up news...the people are catching on!  
 Amos Oz likes to say "the first thing you should know about [his] autobiography is that it's not an autobiography. It's an imposition forced on [him] by the Library of Congress." An interesting confession considering "A Tale" was published  under the genre "memoir" and went on to reap much acclaim - and quite a bit of money -- as a memoir, including The Koret Jewish Book Award for Autobiography. Asked by befuddled interviewers to clarify himself, Mr. Oz will say only that having asked the dead into his home, "they told him the stories he never heard". This is a writerly response, with much truth and sense, but it doesn't excuse Mr. Oz for allowing his publisher to tout the work as a memoir or to blame the Library of Congress. Actually, a good old-fashioned name already exists: a semi-biographical novel. Or, if that's not hip enough, call it a post-modernist novel, then, a nod and a wink to the reader to figure out what is real and what isn't. As it stands,the many fans of Mr. Oz ---until now I've considered myself one --- believe they're hearing true stories, not stories conjured by the artist if he listens hard. This year we've been brutal on American writers who've played on the popular taste for truth; we've held them to standards and shouted "foul" when they haven't lived up to them. It saddens me that a great fiction writer like Mr. Oz hasn't held himself to a higher standard. "Oz" in Hebrew, we're reminded again and again, means "strength." As a "moral conscience of the modern world", as we're also reminded again and again, Mr. Oz demands "strength" from Israelis and Palestinians alike. And yet he wants us to accept with a titter of laughter that he was somehow coerced into calling his "Tale" a memoir. Shame on him. He should know better --- and something tells me he does 
 How Does Catherine Coulter continue to get these awful books published?  Does ANYONE read this stuff before it goes into print?  I've been reading historical romances for 20 years, and this is, without a doubt, the worst reading experience I've ever had!  The flat characters and convoluted story line were bad enough, but the ridiculous, dithering, twit headed dialogue that has become Ms. Coulter's hallmark of late, aggravated me so much that I read not even half of this book before I threw it across the room in disgust!  Mad Jack is much worse (if you can believe it) than Coulter's recycled regencies that she keeps revisiting on the world, and quite frankly, I feel that this book is not worth the paper it's printed on 
 Easily the worst Bellow I've read. There is no story, no structure, no sustained characterization except for Ravelstein, no gentle touches.  No female is given flesh. The book reads like Bellow's notes from the last ten years. The writing, like most of Bellow, is intelligent, sometimes quite perceptive, cold-blooded, and attempts irony and false self-deprecation. At times he seems cagey, sly, contemptuous of readers. Virtually the entire "biography" is woven from pastiche and haphazard observations and self-ruminations. Add a star if you're a big Allen Bloom fan (that's where mine came from) 
 It is pretty bad, it's for people who are willing to suspend their intelligence for the time it takes to read this book. It's a comic book in text form.   But it's par for the course for a Matt Reilly book. It has implausible action, inane dialog and unrealistic 2D characters. You either love it or hate it.  
 Sontag represents a certain type of "intellectual" who is - thankfully - becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband. As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses 
 The magnetic clasp is weak very weak - making it vulnerable to thieves with sticky fingers or opening up on it's own.  I keep this camera case INSIDE of my purse.   i wouldn't recommend this product  there has to be something better       
 I bought this DVD after watching Jessica Simpson's latest music video "These boots are made for walkin'". I thought her Reality Tour Live will have some catchy songs and video but was very disappointed. May be OK for those who just want to watch Jessica sing 
 In the right hands this novel could be translated into an exciting movie.  The premise is interesting, but falls completely flat with the sewn up ending.  A true happily ever after, that begs for a more smartly written sequel in which everything unravels would be delicious.  The hardest aspect to swallow was that this super extra terrestrial life form could divide out of control then just be neatly killed and carried to a lab in the desert for benevolent study.  Sheesh!  I really thought it was going to get scary at some point! The major antagonist of the story is a tattoed up ex inmate who fancies himself a master mind killer-when in reality he is just a sharpshooting (except when it really counts) boob!  And boy does he meet his match in a simple pair of desert folk, who happen to be expert gunslingers and survivalists to boot!  This is all very funny, but to me the funniest part of the entire book is the description of the male tyrannasaur mounting the female and trumpeting loudly in the wild prehistoric world he inhabits!!!! 
 How sad it is read such a poorly written and conceived book about such an interesting subject!  This book is a tragic waste of wonderful material.  I hope that another biographer with greater literary skills decides to take  on Armand Hammer 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 This is a short book with wide spacing, large fonts, and many trivial examples.  To people who have read "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" or other references, this book offers nothing.  Reading the book is often uncomfortable.  The author is not funny, cute, expert, authoritative, or anything else that he tries to be 
 I started out reading Chrys Ingraham's White Weddings with positive attitude.  I am very interested with how the "white wedding came about".  As she went on with the book there were a few problems that did not settle with me.  Number one she often used the words wedding and marriage interchangeably.  These words are two very different in definition and shouldn`t be used in place of one another.  The second thing that I found very hard to handle with her book is that she often would make broad generalizations that would have no factually information to support the idea.  Finally when you read the epilogue she says, "writing this book has been a wrenching experience. Without realizing how fully I've been sutured to dominate heterosexual culture, I have frequently found myself engaged in a variety of internal struggles.  Tears would be streaming down my face as I empathized with the characters in a movie while, at the same time, I would be taking notes critiquing the heterosexual imaginary."  It seems to me that she wrote this book as a statement of how she feels and her opinions.  This is great if it is therapy for her but should not be taken as fact or the answer for other people.  The one educational part of the book was the section about how white weddings are capitalized.  Sweatshops are terrible and it is a horrible feeling to know that people work in awful conditions to make your wedding dress.  This is however should not be the main reason to critizes white weddings, but a reason to make changes.  This book was a start of a good idea but in the end turned into someone else's opinion and platform.  After reading this book no one should feel bad about the choices they make for their own weddings just because they don't fit with what Chrys Ingraham's believes.  A person should make decisions based on what feels right for them 
 Though I am not a Vogue reader, I picked up this book out of curiosity to see what Anna W's splashes in the tabloids were all about.  While the subject is only mildly interesting to me, the author's prose reads like a 300+ page deposition against Anna Wintour from everybody who had/has a major or minor gripe with her. It's a heavy and boring read.  Gossip, if one can get over oneself and admit that it is entertaining, should remain light and diverting. In this book, it is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its author, much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it. I was very happy to put it down.   Perhaps this lackluster effort will compel someone else to attempt a better job. But then again, when that time comes, Anna Wintour may be have disappeared completely from public interest 
   After purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my Presario running XP Home all I get is a message that SSP6 has unexpectedly quite. I emailed tech support w/ the info, but so far no response after 10 days. There is no # to call for support. Maybe I overlooked something.    Also, I submitted the rebate form which came on the package, but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and I need to check w/ them. I did and they said they shipped what VCOM had provided them, which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade.   Not very impressed w/ either the software or the company. Would never buy another product from these guys, even when the price after rebate is 0. LOF 
 After the last Panasonic 4-line debacle....1 key failes in 6 months on ALL handsets YIKES! and with not having a lot of other choices on the market we were forced to buy the new edition of the Panasonic Phone. How bad could it be, we figured.  They have to have figured out how to build a decent handset buy now.  Well, the handset is probably ok, but when we took it 20 feet from the base we lost signa1. WHAT!!?  Called Panasonic and of course customer service probably had never seen the phone suggested to unplug the battery...For Heaven's Sake. Hang up, call back, next person educates me that 5.8 Ghz just means clearer signal, but range is shorter.  WTF??!  We immediately boxed this PIECE OF JUNK up and sent it back!!  Do yourself a favor, buy from a different manufacturer 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 "The Skin I'm In" is fabulous, but I don't think this lives up to it at all. The first third of Bang! is an excellent evocation of a family and a neighborhood in decline.   After that, the book itself declines into unbelievable, author-directed silliness. Even if everything that happens to Mann after his father abandons him in the country is taken at face value, I find it impossible to believe that for a whole month no family member and no person in authority thought to look for the boy at the stable where he loved to go daily. A stable that became convienently empty just in time for him to move into it.   And to call the child Mann when the whole book is about rites of passage into manhood is just ludicrous. The final scenes of supposed redemption between Mann and his father are some of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes I have even read in fiction of any type.   The many messages of the novel are worthy, but the novel itself is quite flawed 
 Rita Mae Brown needs to get an opinion column or a role as a political pundit and quit imposing her political views on her mystery readers.  Pages of sermonizing on various topics as noted by other reviewers padded out this poorly written and skimpily plotted book.  Both the murderer and the method of murder were telegraphed well before the end.  Even Harry isn't as fun as she used to be.  I've read the whole series and agree that it is definitely going down hill.  If I read the next book, I'll get it from the library rather than wasting money buying it.  Sneaky Pie needs a better co-author and editor 
 This is basically an itty-bitty coffee table book (oxymoron, no?) with very little content.  Format:  Picture and on each facing page a large print quote from Dylan.  That's it.  Not very many pages, either.  If you are inclined to meditate upon each thing he ever said, this may be your book, but I would suggest something with a bit more substance.  
 I was so excited to read this book.  I choose this over some of the other options because this seemed like the original source of the information.  But as I started reading it, I started to feel manipulated.  There are so many references in the book to "what you will practice in class".  And there is even a part that states "you will get these cue cards from your instructor".  I bought this book because I didn't have the $300 bucks to spend taking a live class and I don't appreciate that they sell it as a stand alone book, but that it is written as an accompaniement to a birth class.    I didn't feel as though I got enough from the book alone to help me in any way and as I had already done a lot of reading on childbirth, none of the extra information was anything new to me.  Skip this book.  I wish I had 
 I agree with some of the other reviewers that this is most likely a work of fiction.  There is no real information given about the supposed author, Helmut Jung, other than his "incredible" wartime exploits. There are too many mistakes in the book about Jung's training and service to believe this is anything more than a piece of fiction put together by the American writer...it doesn't read or feel right.  Save your money and buy "Black Edelweiss" for a real biography of a German soldier 
 Be aware that this book was labeled as 'trash' by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, and that the Food and Drug Administration issued a paper claiming the author destorts his facts.  The book supports and suggests a chain of clinics called 'HealthMed', which are run by Scientologists.  Make up your own mind 
 I bought one for my son at Christmas and it broke after a month.  It just suddenly wouldn't turn on.  Amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days, before even getting the original back.  But the replacement model "froze up" after just 4 days and this time I am getting a refund.  To quote an e-mail from Amazon regarding this product "As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than  we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement."  So, DO NOT order one! 
 At Marx's graveside, Engels praised him as a revolutionary -- which he was -- and credited him with two of the greatest scientific discoveries in human history: first, that "just as Darwin discovered the law of development of organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of development of human history" and second, that Marx had discovered the "special law of motion" without which all previous economics "had been groping in the dark." Setting history on equal scientific footing with evolutionary biology, and making economics for the first time truly scientific would indeed be astounding accopmlishments.  Neither claim, however, can be supported by the evidence. No one who is not a convinced Marxist can take either claim very seriously.  How seriously, then, should one take Monique Wittig's dialectical materalist feminism, in which male/female relations become another (albeit, all-important) variant on the class struggle?  Consider for a moment the passage that the above reviewer cites with approval:  "The perenniality of the sexes and the perenniality of slaves and masters proceed from the same belief, and, as there are no slaves without masters, there are no women without men. The ideology of sexual difference functions as censorship in our culture by masking, on the grounds of nature, the social opposition between man and women. Masculine/feminine, male/female are the categories which serve to conceal the fact that social differences always belong to an economic, political, ideological order. ...The masters explain and justify the established divisions as a result of natural differences."  Mastery and slavery are reciprocal relations. A master is necessarily a "master of ..." and a slave the "slave of ..." Reduce the situation to its simplest form: one master and one slave. If the master dies, the slave, having no master, is no slave; if the slave dies, the master, having no slave, is no master. Is it even remotely plausible to say that a man is always the "man of ..." or a woman a "woman of ..."? Let there be two, a man and a woman (the garden we can dispense with). If the man dies, is there no longer a woman, or vice versa?  One might wish to consider that "the perenniality of sexes" has at least *something* to do with sexual dimorphism in animals, something which, since it predates the human species, presumably also predates the human social "beliefs" which are said by Wittig to give rise to it.  Wittig makes some fair points about the use and abuse of sex differentiation as ideology, but her reasoning is constantly undercut by her fallacious inference from the ideological *use* of something X for political purposes to something X's *being* no more than an ideological construction. Are ideological appeals to nature sometimes used to mask social oppositions, as Wittig says? Yes. Does it follow that all appeals to nature are therefore either false or ideological? No. Are the categories male/female sometimes used to conceal differences which are in reality social, economic, and political? Yes. Does it follow that the categories male/female are merely ideological artifacts which exist only for the purpose of such concealment? No. Do oppressors always appeal to the natural order of things to justify their oppressions? Yes. Does it follow that all appeals to nature are attempted justifications of oppression on the part of would-be oppressors? No. &c.  Strictly speaking, Wittig's thought is impossible on its own terms, for "the primacy of difference so constitutes our thought that it prevents turning inward on itself to question itself, no matter how necessary that may be to apprehend the basis of that which precisely constitutes it." But, this, of course, is what Wittig proposes to do. We cannot be surprised -- for we recall that Marx's thought -- which exposed all previous (and indeed all non-Marxist thought) as mere ideology driven by material factors -- was itself exempt from that harsh fate, was instead, science. So too Wittig will provide us with an account that cannot be given by anyone lacking her dialectical materialism (i.e. her), and cannot be refuted by anyone at all -- since arguing against is, after all, with Freud, to further validate the theory.  Like Marx, Wittig is a bringer of enlightenment: "Women do not know that they are totally dominated by men, and when they acknowledge the fact, they can 'hardly believe it.' " One wonders what sort of "fact" is meant here, within the historicist, social-constructivist framework in which Wittig situates her discourse. One also wonders about this lack of knowledge on the part of women. Totally dominated! And unawares! Perhaps one wonders less at their incredulity upon being informed.  But matters are even worse: "And often ... they refuse to 'believe' that men dominate them with full knowledge." But the truth must out. (I am guessing that Wittig writes "believe" because, once she has delievered her revelation, on one can actually refuse to believe it -- at most, they can refuse to "believe" it). Men may also refuse to "believe" it, but unlike the benighted women, they have the knowledge that women (Wittig excepted) lack. Even Marx was never so bold as to credit the capitalists with anything beyond a clear view of their own short-sighted economic interest. But men are here an nigh omniscient class of oppressors -- although there seems to be a bit of a chicken and egg problem with this, if "men" and "women" are created only by men oppressing women, but there were neither men to oppress nor women to be oppressed before the oppression -- how did this all get started? But no matter! Has not Jean Paulhan said that women are slaves and love their slavery, in his preface to The Story of O? Ipse dixit; ergo hoc verum est.  "It cannot be said," Wittig says, "that one of these two productions (reproduction) is 'natural', while the other one is social." Again, Marx at least never attempted to formulate a theory of the class struggle for the means of production among the non-human species. Why? Because production, labor, work is what (for Marx) makes the human species distinctively human. A good argument for there being at least something natural about reproduction (it seems to me) is that it takes place both in non-human animals and it took place (as I presume Wittig would admit) in the pre-historic, pre-political evolutionary history of the human species. *That* reproduction may be commodified is not in question, but is it truly the case that to suggest that it is, in some sense, natural, to give "only the theoretical, ideological justification for oppression"?  Wittig writes in a powerful polemical style, but her argumentation, such as it is, proceeds in turn by assertion, appeal to quotations by (dubious) authorities, appeal to dubious theory (e.g. dialectical materialism) as if its truth were established, false analogies, and unwarranted inferences that (interestingly) always seem to arrive at pre-given truths as their conclusions. This is, in short, a book for the already convinced, or at best, a book for those willing to be convinced by rhetoric, revolutionary fervor, and righteous indignation rather than reasoning.  I cannot recommend it as a work of serious, thoughtful feminism 
 My grandmother and my mother have read Danielle Steele for years, but I must admit I'd never picked one up. I was always more for historical romances. But I wanted something different, had heard good things about her, so while at the library, decided to give her a try. I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. Granted, I'm a fellow writer (a very picky reader by nature), and an unpublished one to boot, but the writing could've been better in my opinion. The first five pages are all backstory of Paris's marriage (no action, no excitement, told very "history lesson-ish") and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between Paris and her husband (the inciting incident in the first chapter) left me wondering, "So what?". Twenty five pages in, I could care less about these people. I honestly expected more from a bestselling author. 
 ...Meaning, I am not enamored of this book.  It was overlong, silly, poorly written, repetitive, it had cardboard characters, and was nothing but a soap opera which happened to be set in early 20th-century Japan.  To top it off, the sex scenes were gruesome and boring.    I was hoping this book was better than the movie (which I saw first), but it wasn't.  Also, why glorify the lives of women who were basically just high-priced prostitutes, who sold their virginity and selves to the highest bidder?    Real Japanese culture could never be as dull as this book.  
 I am a recent college graduate, so the premise of the story was definitely intriguing to me. The beginning of the story was written in such a choppy and direct, yet appealing style that I was excited about the possibilities of where this book would take me. As the story went on though I found that the "twist" or "spin" that I expected the story to take never occurred. From the first chapter this book gets progressively worse until you are left closing the book in disappointment. I love Land's style of writing. That was the only thing that kept me interested just enough to finish this book. I would pass on this story, but I am interested in seeing Land's creative technique combined with a worthy story to go along with it. 
 Readers interested in Benny Morris should read Israeli historian Yehoshua Porath's "War and Remembrance" in the summer 2002 issue of Azure. Porath adds to the Oct. 1995 and April 1990 discussions by Robert Satloff and Shabtai Teveth in Middle Eastern Studies and to Efraim Karsh's  excellent book, Fabricating Israeli History. Don't read this book without looking at these critiques.   Why? Morris et al tell readers they have written "new" history of Israel, considering the entire previous historical record as if it were solely propaganda for the Zionist cause. Here, Morris considers Jewish conduct in the 1947 and 1948, and why the Arabs fled.   Morris claims to be the first person to have looked at Israeli archives on the Dalet Plan, a plan to move populations in certain areas. Nevertheless, other scholars show that Morris and his peers in this book misrepresent themselves and the facts.   Firstly, Yigael Alon and Israel Galili, in The Book of the Palmah, gave Walid Khalidi material to argue in 1959 that the Dalet Plan was "the master plan of the Zionists" to expell Palestinians wholesale. Furthermore, the 1973 History of the Hagana (by Uri Millstein) included the entire Dalet Plan text. Official or not, these 1959 and 1973 Israeli Jewish histories, very shortly after the the 1948 war, did not hide what happened, as Morris claims here.  Morris also writes that Arab government archives were closed to his research and and to other historians writing on the Israeli-Arab conflict before him. He writes that he relied on Israeli and Western archives. But Porath, Karsh, Satloff and Teveth all show that this is not the case.   Furthermore, Morris did no research at the Hagannah archives or those of the IDF, a fact underlined by Efraim Karsh in 2002, and one which he admits in a more recent book (The War for Palestine). Morris now writes that in the mid 1980s both those archives were closed to all researchers after all. He writes, he was limited to few first-hand military materials, indicating that there is no "new" research here at all.   Morris' charge that Israel carried out a deliberate and systematic expulsion of the Palestinian Arabs isn't even remotely substantiated by extensive research done since the mid 1980s. On the contrary, Morris takes material very selectively, from Israeli archive fringes and makes what Porath terms "outrageoulsy false claims"-- that Israel's victory resulted from "an imperialist conspiracy or an overwhelming advantage in manpower and arms."   Indeed, Morris writes here that Arabs left Israel because of many factors, their departure was not the fault of the Jewish people alone. Then, he contradicts himself, giving those who hate Israel grounds to blame Israel for the exodus, without considering the other circumstances.   This book also details a so-called "massacre" in 1948 of Arabs at the village of Deir Yassin, but not enough to mention that the incident was actually a battle--in which most Arabs killed (like those in Jenin in March and April 2002) were armed.   Finally, Morris does not note (by comparison) other massacres in 1948--of Jews, by Arabs. On December 30, 1947, for example, Arabs murdered some 50 Jewish co-workers at the Haifa refinery. On April 13, 1948, they massacred over 80 Jewish doctors, nurses and Hebrew University workers on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem.   Additionally, nearly all of the 131 people who surrendered at the Etzion Bloc were also murdered by Palestinian Arabs. Only two survived.  These latter Arab massacres of Jews do not fit the blame that Morris seeks to lay at Jewish feet. Nor does the fact that Jews did not afterwards flee, as occurred on the Arab side following the battle at Deir Yassin. So Morris omits them.   I also find it disturbing that the book nowhere mentions the equal refugee claim of 1 million Jewish refugees from 22 Arab nations, who were expelled with nothing but the shirts on their backs, and rebuilt their lives in Israel, the U.S., and Europe.   The number of Jewish refugees was actually larger than that of Arab refugees (counting only those who fled, not their descendants). Honest history would have noted these parallels as well as the entire context of the war.   --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 Once again, Spike Lee hits us again with the polemics. Overall, the story is not bad. The basic idea of a bus ride to the MMM is a good one. SOME of the characters are nicely drawn, such as Charles Roc Dutton's bus driver, Ossie Davis as the patriarch, and the caring father of the wayward son. But the film is weighed down by Spike Lee's usual soapbox dialogue and polemics. Sadly, few of the characters in this film actually talk, they make speeches (as is the case with "The Red Menace" and "Putney Swope)." Like I said, the story itself is good and the above-mentioned characters are nicely drawn. But the dialogue? Go to the soapbox on 125th St. in Harlem as the Black nationalist pontificators pound the podium and you get the idea 
 Tons of statistical data supporting the concept of low cost index funds.  I am invested in the Vanguard S&P 500 Index as well as other index funds, but this is a bit too much.  If you understand the concept of indexing, save some cash and skip this book 
 This show, as a CD at least, is generic Andrew Loyd Webber with no real high points. It's not bad but as other reviewers have mentioned it's pretty darn familar. I don't have strong feelings about ALW. Most people seem to love or hate him. It seems to me that with the exception of the arguably great EVITA, he's better at coming up with some achingly beautiful songs than completely successful musicals.  The most important point I have to make, however, is that the source material for this show is really first-rate. The Victorian Wilkie Collins was the inventor of the mystery novel and a great suspense novelist. It would be a shame to ruin the suprises in THE WOMAN IN WHITE by listening to this cd before reading the book. It's almost a masterpiece; the musical is just so-so.  One crucial warning, however. Because Collins is now regarded as Literature, the back covers of all his novels and the  introductions and prefaces to them MUST NOT BE READ before you read the novels themselves. A key twist that happens on about page 400 of the 500-page MAN AND WIFE is REVEALED ON THE BACK OF ONE EDITION. The first 100 pages of my personal favorite Collins novel, NO NAME, are enjoyable but not earth-shaking. Then BAM! out of the blue all the pieces fall into place and the book becomes a rollercoaster -- hundreds of pages of almost uninterupted thrills. If you read the back cover in advance  you'll know more or less where the first hundred pages are leading.  Okay, maybe all of the above doesn't belong in a review of this CD -- but you really should give Collins a try. (His later work -- post-1870 -- gets pretty uneven so don't start with that.)  Lastly, David Zippel's lyrics are a real disappointment. By and large they're just passable -- pretty close to the mediocre Don Black. Zippel is usually better 
 To be blunt, Laura Lee Smith's Christy is petulant and immature.  I like Diane Ladd as an actress, but her portrayal of Alice Henderson is bland.  Thumbs up to the men -- Stewart Finaly-McLennan and James Waterson.  Also, Dale Dickey did a great job with the role of Opal McHone and I thought Emily Perkins and Olivia Kelly were outstanding as Zady Spencer and Ruby Mae (respectively.  The script could have provided a much better transitions in several place.  Most notably, we see the good-by to one beau.  It would have been more emotionally satisfying to see her say "YES!" to the other.  While some performances were excellent, the movie must stand on the overall performance of the cast, director and screenwriters.  With Christy and Alice being so central to the story, it simply doesn't make it.  We all knew who she would end up with, anyway, didn't we???  Much better to go back and watch the CBS series or better yet, read the book!  
 I was very disappointed with the ending of this new Danielle Steel.  It seemed like a very long read, with a very quick ending.  I have read every one of her books, and have never been so disappointed with a story until now.  I would not recommend this to anyone 
 "A Music Fan" says he only knew one of these songs?!! What cave has he been living in?? His gross lack of music knowlege is scary! You can do better than this compilation - Too few songs and chosen rather arbitrarily. The songs are classics though. Still can't believe previous reviewer didn't know "Sounds of Silence", "Pretty Woman", etc. --- How sad 
 I usually cook everything from scratch and don't mind spending a few hours making several appetizers. BUT, to make just one  recipe in this book, you'd need to spend a couple of hours. The majority of the recipes are too fussy and complicated and just not worth the trouble. I made a couple of the crepe appetizers with different fillings. They were the least time-consuming but the result still wasn't worth the effort - no one took seconds 
 This book makes no mention of Table Occurrences or Table Occurrence Groups, so if you plan to build or modify a database with many complex relationships, buy the Missing Manual book or the Filemaker Pro Business Applications book instead 
 Parents who judge education systems/software by ability to keep the attention of today's ADD children regardless of actual educational content may like this.  They'll be the only ones though since there is no educational content.  "I love birthday parties, yeah" - "They're here, let the party begin" - "oink oink".  This is all we here from these machines when we use them, which isn't often.  Kids click on the pictures to elicit related and often unrelated noises - that is it.  There is little actual phonics training.  The phonics "games" only ask about one softball question per minute surrounded by a lot of ADD attention getting fluff.  These are entertainment systems, not educational systems.  We should note that the Leapfrog brand DVDs we have are not like the Leappads at all.  The DVDs are very good.  The Leappads are worthless 
 Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
 I'm sure once you wade through all of his unsupported statistics, you'll find some useful advice from Mr. Lawhon, but I'm completely turned off by his assertions of 75% of this and 25% of that, for which he has no documentation.  If only I still owned the book (I was reimbursed for it by my employer), I would go back through it with a pen and redline all the useless crap.  After reading Book One, I feel discouraged, which is perhaps what the author wanted--to discourage anyone who wasn't wholeheartedly committed to selling.  (I started to write "110% committed," but then I would be guilty of misusing percentages in much the same manner as Mr. Lawhon. 
 I gave this film two stars. One star,because i liked all the good character actors and actresses.And another star,for the quirky folk-rock tune,'i'm easy',sung by surprised oscar-winner ,Keith Carradine.-Henry Bateman Gibson was one of the funniest stars of 'Laugh-In',as was Lily Tomlin.Henry was approached,by Altman, to star in this ,after several others backed out.When it tries to be serious,i find myself laughing.Tomlin does play a very serious part,as the mother of a deaf child.And,she played the role well.All the good actors/actresses,in this comic-farce/tradgey ,are wrong for the roles.No one in the real Nashville music business,could understand how "outside people",could make a credible film ,on them. The film did not play well,and was quickly shelved.It's a strange and unique film to watch though. Its lasting effect is simple.No one associated with the film ,really understand what the country-music scene was/is in reality.The film just reinforces silly steorotypes of the South.     
 La Femme Nikita is still my favorite program of all time, with nothing coming close.   The music on the show worked to create an atmosphere that was eclectic.    But without the visuals of the characters in play, the songs are not compelling (with the noted exception of "Love Thieves").    If you love Nikita, but you're over 40, skip the CD 
 This book started out promisingly, and the first part of it is an interesting introduction to American law.  Unfortunately, the last half of the book is almost exclusively about politics and administration.  He spends whole sections on things like New Deal agencies and Great Society programs.  Certainly, these were "laws" passed by Congress, but they don't tell us anything about the justice system.  If you want to learn about the American legal system, I'd suggest Law 101 instead.  It's not historically based, but you'll learn a lot more about how the system functions, and the principles on which it is based, than from this book 
 I like most of Jodi Picoult's books, but this was the worse one I have ever read. The story line was ridiculous and unbelievable. The main character in the book, Trixie, is a teenager with problems but her parents never seem to realize this. They go to incredible lengths to protect her and never hold her responsible for any of her actions. The drawings in the book were distracting and annoying. I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 Seeing that I don't own the DVD copy of Bud and Lou's famous-"A&C Meet Frankenstein", I really enjoy the Best Of...Vol.4, if just for the fine documentary about their most famous film.  This was one of three documentaries (of sorts), included with this collection.  But, then you get the classic A&C Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde too.  The price was right, so I was very pleased with my purchase 
 A big disappointment.After filling with hot water as instructed the water temp cooled off immediately regardless of the "warmer" as advertized.It was too shallow to cover the feet if massage attachments were in place.I returned it for a refund 
 Just like the old Chariots of Gods, his books are very interesting and and entertaining.  But please dont think that you are reading a scientific work.  Real historical works are not as sexy and entertaining as these books just as real archeologists are not Indiana Joneses.  
 American lives.  Hannity receives his talking points every day from the RNC, and then repeats them like the Summoner from "Canterbury Tales," repeating his two or three Latin phrases.  Hannity's phrases: - Liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm's way.  - Liberals don't want to defend America and fought Homeland Security every step of the way (when it was Bush who fought it)  - Howard Dean hates republicans, he is unhinged, so is Hillary, Al Gore, John Kerry, and every republican except for Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman.  - Osama bin laden was offered up to Clinton on a silver platter. (never happened)  So, as Al Franken says, Hannity knows 11 facts, all of which are outright lies, or misrepresentations, so please don't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows.  Don't waste your money on this book - it, and he, are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other.  He is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut, begotten on his listeners' backs 
 Light is beautiful and functional, and so great for traveling, but first LED light failed almost immediately and second after about 2 months.  Too bad. 
 The various authors consistently demonstrate a deep mis(or non)-understaning of the faith.  Regeneration by external ritual baptism is empty.  It is off-the-mark in dangerous ways for leaders of churches and institutions of learning, like these men appear to be, to give anybody the impression that they are saved - as they do in this book - by the ritual of water baptism.  Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.  Salvation is effected by the Word and the Spirit within an individual, not through a mediating corporate/collective church body or 'sacrament'.  The theology expressed in this book is old and rears its head usually at a time when God's Plan is at a crossroads or interval.  Faith comes from God, not baptism.  True baptism is the work of the Holy Spirit within one giving one a new nature.  A renewed soul.  The environment this takes place in (or the effecting agent) is the Word of God itself.  Read the Word of God, and do it humbly; being God-centered rather than proud and man-centered.  Now that these various theologians and church leaders have decided on calling their 'new' movement 'the federal vision' it can tidily be dumped into the wastebasket of history with all other man-centered, proud, unBiblical and just simply dead wrong theologies and false gospels.  A very strong non-recommendation for this book 
 Arthur Phillips created an awesome plot for his novel, but trying to read it at times was like pulling teeth. Normally once I pick a book up I can't bring myself to put it down... this book however, i couldn't bring myself to keep reading even whe i was bedridden for three days with nothing else to do.  The theory behind this plot was amazing, but the story-line was way too convoluted, and the huge twist was entirely too predictable. I physically reading a book and flipping back and forth between chapters, but the only way I could finish this novel was by listening to the audio book 
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 The book was a copy of the textbook. The print quality is so bad it looks like the words are disappearing in front of your eyes. 
 I purchased this thinking it would be a bona fide swim trunk.  After all, the word "trunk" is in its description.  It ends up being an athletic support brief in a box cut; hardly something a serious swimmer would think of wearing.  
 The whole book just meandered from the get-go, never going anywhere.  One could surmise early who would be killed and who the killer would be, but the murder was certainly an afterthought.  I'm also tired of Qwill's relationship with the boring Polly.  And the great number of times he mentions his mustache.  A great disappointment!  -- Pa 
 ...I just can't. I like Lon. I like most of his books. This one is crap. It is all humor and little content. What useful information that is there is so badly presented that it invalidates any legitimacy it may have had. I have no problem with humor -- in fact, I think a sense of humor is vital (that's why I gave it an extra star!). Unfortunately, there is not enough real content to justify it. If you are already familier with the Hermetic Kabalah, then Chicken Qabalah may be good for a laugh, but as a real guide for beginners (or anyone, really), it is unenlightening, misleading, and disappointing. The truly sad part is that he knows better. Read his "Angels, Demons & Gods of the New Millennium" -- a much better work that shows that he *does* know his Kether from his Malkuth. Did you really need the money that badly? Shame on you, Lon! 
 The book E-myth Revised covers more information and is 1/3 the price of this book. Maybe buy this book if you don't understand E-myth and just need it explained to you in different words. Very dissappointed and thought this was a waste of money 
 This is one of the worst strategy guides Prima has put out in recent memory.  The book offers no insight into the different races and does not even aknowledge the unique units produced by the Vinci.  There are no tables, no charts, and no tips.  No multiplayer tips.  You would be better off going onto the website.  Don't waste your money 
 what we are left with is another middle-aged male who had to leave his wife (who stayed through all the s**t)and children in order to "find himself".  Not suprisingly in  the arms of a YOUNG blonde "angel".  Kudos to him for getting sober--a rasberry to him for what he has done with his soberity and to the immediate family who loved him through to it 
 I bought this book based on the great reviews from other customers. But, I don't see what they see. I see parents and kids wearing clothes from the  early 80's and information that can't possibly be more basic. There's  nothing wrong with the basics, but there are plenty of books that give the  basics and more in a creative and entertaining way. Well ... at least it  was cheap 
 ... apparently his magic wand was malfunctioning.  To Baldacci's credit his writing style is his only asset when it comes to keeping readers interested and wanting them to find out who did what and why. That's why I gave two stars. But all throughout the book I constantly felt that I was reading yet another "blockbuster" garbage. The book did not add any meaning, I did not care for the characters at all, and Baldacci did a great job ruining the ending 
 this dvd will not play at all.  i contacted amazon and haven't received a response.  i will say this is the very first problem i have had with them in all the years i have been ordering.  
 This book is funny because of the writers comments mostly, although there are a few times where you will be wondering how our parents or grandparents survived. A lot of the time, I found myself "standing up" for the old-fashioned advice because honestly, a lot of it made sense when you think about the era.  For example, they still teach us that newspaper can help with delivering a baby if there are not better materials available.    It is worth a read if you have an hour to kill, but I probably would not purchase it again since reading it once is enough. 
 It would have been much better if this book had never been written.  The story in this volume takes place in the time period after the wandering photographer (Robert Kincaid) left Madison County, Iowa, following his short love affair with the conventional wife of an Iowa farmer (Francesca Johnson), until his death.  Actually there is not much discussion about Francesca; rather the story is focused on Robert's new discovery of his forgotten son produced from a one-night sexual encounter with a free-spirited girl in Northern California when Robert was much younger.  This epilogue dilutes the beautiful love story between Robert and Francesca described in The Bridges of Madison County, which I have always defended against pretentious friends who regarded it as a trashy romance novel.  It appears to me that Robert James Waller was forced to write this terrible "A Thousand Country Roads" for some reason which I don't understand 
 When I discovered the existence of this novel, I was enthusiastic and intrigued. Unfortunately, my hopes were more or less dashed as I trundled my way through the 382 pages. KLEOPATRA focuses on the famous queen's early years - a period of time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family (something she may have compensated for in adulthood). What I liked: 1). The spelling of Kleopatra/ Cleopatra with a "K"- it really does emphasize that Hellenistic connection; 2) Kleopatra's strength of character- Essex's general characterization is appropriate and it's easy to see what Kleopatra will become.  Although the novel is a noble attempt by Karen Essex, it just didn't work for me. The character of Berenike as an Amazon seemed a bit far-fetched. And although I loved Kleopatra's love interest (I won't give away his name!), I felt it was a bit far-fetched as well, almost as if Essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something. Kleopatra's Dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe, as was Mohama. There were also scenes of random sex that were a bit... unnecessary. Overall, although Kleopatra was a strong, believable character, she was in the minority. The novel as a sort of back-story to the Queen of Egypt didn't work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction! At least the sequel is better. For fiction that works, check out The Memoirs of Cleopatra by Margaret George. 
 Perhaps I was distracted when I heard these short stories, but they seemed to lack substance.  The characters seemed like passing shadows - I never knew them well enough to have any solid emotional attachment.  The stories  were all very short, and most felt incomplete.  If you are just starting  with Hemingway, try something else first.  If you like his style, I'm sure  you'll love this collection 
 Wow.  I thought because OK Computer was such a good album this book would probably be pretty good.   But then I read it.  The writing is so stale and unemotional that the author is unable to actually articulate what the album means to anyone.  Instead, she uses chords and stupid bpm graphs to talk about the songs and othing about their emotional weight.  Plain and simple, This book SUCKED don't waste your money on it.  Buy the one on Let it Be by the Replacemnts instead 
 This book may be helpful for some people who want to know more about possible conspiracies. Personally, I believe some of them; but that's not why I purchased this book. This book is highly misrepresented on Trudeau's infomecials. There are no specific recommendations for treatment of any illnes in this book. Only some vague references to start you on a paper chase. There is not even an index in the book to direct you to information on a specific illness. This book is basically another infomercial for his subscription website. 
 In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to "do Europe". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack.  In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip.  "Neither Here Nor There" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him.  Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had.  Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees "the sights" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications.  This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.   But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe:  1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result.  2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by.  3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar.  4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices.  This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean:  "Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team." (pg 32)  "The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there." (pg 91)  "In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide." (pg 97)  "But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime." (pg 110)  "I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people." (pg 123)  In conclusion, if you're someone who "did Europe" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book.

 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 She has alot of wonderful ideas. If it is a new concept for you to have  play and joy in your marriage, pick up this book.She is the pide piper .The ride with her is a blast.But reader be warned of what is behind her teachings.She is simplistic and even cruel.  She has no respect for anyone who disagrees with her.She puts down feminism,therapy,medication and 12 step programs. In her view,addiction,abuse,even depression is a choice.Her worshiping followers hide the fact that they get help from other sources than her,for fear of reproachment.And if you disagree with her,you are called a loser.  And by the way,she is getting a divorce 
 The content of this "book" is fine but it should be advertised for what it is; a pamphlet. I expected a "book" (more than 17 pages.)  I cannot quibble with the scope but it is very cursory.  No depth to the content.  I would liken it to an outline or a brochure; definitely not a "book." Actually I felt a bit "ripped off." 
 Pros: Someone recommended this book to me, and when he did, I asked him why in the world would he think I'd be interested in a book written by a cop, specifically because I've never made it a secret that I do NOT trust police and I'm extremely burnt out on the Biggie/Tupac's death considering I wasn't a fan of either of them.  He told me that it talked about some interesting parts of hip hop crime and that there was only one chapter on Biggie and Tupac.  Indeed, he was right. This book delved into the Jam Master Jay killing, along with the criminal issues of Murder Inc., Young Jeezy, Jay-Z, Diddy, 50 Cent, J. Lo, Lil' Kim, Foxxy Brown, Suge Knight, Snoop, Game, Dr. Dre, etc., in addition to the murders of Freaky Tah, Tupac, Biggie, and more.  It was interesting to read about the details that I did not hear in these cases, such as cops handcuffing J. Lo to the top of the cage.  That's a prime example of why I feel the way I feel about cops. Was it really necessary to do that?  In that aspect, I can feel this book. There were many times when Parker complained about how the NYPD handled witnesses and innocent victims as though they were criminals, and he hit it right on the head by explaining that if the NYPD continues to be as domineering and violent as they have been to get people to talk, the streets and crime will continue to be on different playing fields with no intentions of a fair game.  Cons: 1) I'll admit that even as a professional copyeditor, I can look over errors. It's much safer to let at least two pairs of eyes read a manuscript than one. I'm hoping that's what happened with this book. No copyeditor will catch every single error, but about a quarter through this book, I was seeing so many errors to the point where I wondered was it copyedited at all?  Commas out of place, words in the wrong order, past tense with present tense, and other glaring errors that should've been caught by even the most casual reader.  2) I was so tired of this man patting himself on the back.  It was to the point where I thought he was molesting himself trying to talk about how great he was.  He kept italicizing "I" and "me" as if we didn't understand that he deserved credit for something. Then, he kept on bragging about how cops were coming to him for help because he knew about hip hop.  In mid-story, he'd start talking about how he knew something was wrong because he was so well-informed of the subject.  Okay, we get it.  If the man had just told the story and his actions, we could've come to the same conclusion without reading about you and your Hip-Hop Superman Cape.    3) Over and over again, he made idiotic statements that only cops can come to the conclusion of.  The word "accidentally" and "Amadou Diallo" should NEVER be used in the same sentence. That was flat-out intended murder; nothing accidental about it. Even though he kept saying that hip-hop was not the full reason for violence, he kept throwing out all these random examples about how they equate, without ever mentioning the fact that poverty can play a great big hand in that.  He uses examples like Kanye West to say that some rappers don't go down the same violent path, but what a drastic comparison.  Kanye West didn't live nearly the life that Snoop Doggy Dogg did and there's no way anybody is going to tell me that the neighborhood and economic gain does not play a hand in the attitudes that many "gangsters" and drug dealers have in how they view life.  This is not to say that it is right for them to be suicidal all the time, but I can't see how he couldn't understand that.  4) Throughout this whole book, he made it seem like he was one of the best cops and he seldomly talks about anything he does wrong. Even when he does, he blames it on his boss making him do it (ex. creating the hip-hop binder).  He claims he's not a drinker but consistently talks about how he doesn't remember certain places he was at because he was so drunk and having fun.  He talks about how other cops were scared but he was excited to be in drug-ridden, violent areas of Brooklyn.  That in itself concerns me.  To me, that's like saying that this cop viewed these areas like the board game Clue.  He may find it amusing that he caught the killer, but none of these killers, witnesses, and children in the area find their everyday life "fun."  It's very easy to criticize one's lifestyle when you don't have to live it on an everyday basis.  5) The man seems to have all of these answers about how the NYPD and LAPD should operate to be a more productive police force, but there was something he did in this book that only stamped the "Why I Hate Cops" attitude into just about everyone who mildly thought it before.  There's a huge no-snitch policy in poverty-stricken areas (and quite a few middle-income areas too, the more the police act a fool)!  Every single time he talked about issues within criminal cases, he gave out real names of witnesses, as well as ALL the information they gave. He talked about buying them food and how so many were cooperative in telling their stories.  But the information he gave may not have all been accessible to the public.  Some of the killers got off free, and I don't even understand why he put so much information about what the victims said in this book.  Does he think all criminals don't read?  All they need is ONE friend to say that their name was mentioned in the book, and there's a whole new set of problems for these witnesses.  Victims and witnesses risk their lives telling stories about what has happened around them, and a cop documenting all the details in the book does not make anybody feel safer to go running to the cops. If anything, it makes them more hesitant.  Just about every chapter, I was shaking my head and thinking "He can't help it. He's a cop.  He doesn't understand how goofy it is to document this type of information."  Even if it's someone who hasn't been in a situation where they have to be a witness, a cop repeatedly bothering you can work a person's nerves to the point where they don't want to help you simply because they don't like YOU.  I went to a high school a block away from a police station and was harrassed ALL the time for unexplainable reasons, even as a reasonably innocent teenage girl.  It's going to take more than the no-snitch rule to get people to help in these communities. Cops have to pretty much change their WHOLE attitude before a lot of these people will trust them.  6) He speculates on how hip-hop is becoming organized crime and how Jay-Z and 50 Cent have marketing deals. I don't even understand this comparison.  It's not like these were dudes fresh off the street who walked in rapping and got gymshoes.  They both had to fight their way to the top for these companies to even pay attention to them.  Yes, they were both drug dealers IN THE PAST. So what?  Is every marketing company supposed to look at their background, ignore the fact that they are legit now, and not do business with them? If that's the case, America wouldn't have survived this long. This country was created from thieves and slaveowners.  If Wall Street can get rich, so can hip-hop.  Parker talks about how most Fortune 500 companies wouldn't do business with people with this background.  I hate to break it to this dude, but if companies weren't going to get rich off of criminals, America wouldn't be one of the most powerful countries that it is now off of FREE labor and the attitude "well, it's all in the past now."    As I figured, I didn't like this book and it didn't improve my opinion on cops, but when he wasn't talking about how great he was, I did find out some missing information that the media has screwed up in their daily reports 
 Maybe I'm jaded by having read so many other far superior books documenting information about alleged UFO crashes, sightings, abductions, etc., but DARK OBJECT read more like an overlong pamphlet than it did a book.  The authors attempt at research is basically reduced to a series of telephone conversations, eyewitness interviews, and newspaper clipping summaries that add up to nothing.  In the final chapter, they make the allegation that not only was one saucer downed, but there were two!  It read like bad fiction, more than a hard core examination of what evidence was available.  The cover speaks of officials denying the events contained within, but the authors didn't discuss anyone who denied anything!  They just didn't want to talk about it.  Go reread ALIEN AGENDA 
 Please, please please do yourselves a favor and get Fingersmith instead.  It is infinitely better than this, at times,  laughable adaptation.  TTV was ruined by a bad script and, I hate to say it, lead actress Rachael Stirling.  Not only did she look so completely uncomfortable in her love scenes, her voice was incredibly irritating.  I was not impressed with the choices she made as an actor, playing the role of Nan.  There are some heterosexual actress who can really pull off playing a gay character.  Rachael is not one of them.  And she is in every scene.  Every moment.  The story is told completely through her eyes.  It's a shame because this could have been so much better than it was.    BTW, Sarah Waters is an amazing writer.  Definitely check out her books, Fingersmith, Affinity, and The Night Watch 
 This book is difficult to follow because it is written in the format of an academic student's report.  Little background knowledge is given, so a person unfamiliar with Chinese politics could easily get lost.  I felt more like I was reading a high school report put together primarily for the benefit of the author.  Unless you are very familiar with the Communist Party of China's organization, this book is not very good to start out with if you are interested in learning about China's new economy 
 It's sad to say that this is a more a novel than a biography ,far from a history.Basically ,it stressed too much on the history of surgery, and westernized medicine oriented ,over-pessimistic in the "triumph" of of the modern medicine.However ,this book presents terrific narratives,just like the style of Dr. Nuland 
 James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers.   I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem?  Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 As a long fan of Stargate SG-1, why wait so long for Season 9 to be released only for short segments to have been removed from the episodes?  Are the customers being sold future syndicated versions of these episodes?  I must say, I'm not pleased.  MGM, Sony, Fox and Amazon, what's up 
 I am currently in an ethics class and this book was required for the course. This is by far the most repetitive and useless book you will ever use in your entire life. NO JOKE. It offers no insight into things that you dont already know. It simply takes what you already know, puts it into fancier words, and spits it right back at you. If this book is not a requirement for a class then dont waste your money. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to go throw this peice of crap in a volcano and forget I was ever plagued by its stupidity and uselessness 
 I'am unable to get this message to anyone.  This is the second book I orderd and both books are bad.  This one starting on disc #4 all is bad. I sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me.  I had the same problem on Vanishing Point, the cd left will not play on my player.  I will not order another book from You. Once I can see this happen, but twice is unacceptable 
 Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Ano 
 I was really expecting to get more out of this book.  First of all, I find the Daily 16 to be an excellent workout.  I had visible results after the first few days.  The rest of the book, however, is too thin.  Outside the Daily 16, the book really was not helpful.  It has sections on recruit training and on OCS, but they are mostly photographs with little information.  Most pages have a giant photograph and only one paragraph of text.  The recruit and OCS sections merely focus on certain points of training and do not give a comprehensive overview that you would expect out of a full-size book.  The writing style is also juvenile and simplistic, almost on a child's level.  In summary, the boot camp and OCS sections (more than half of the book) are nothing new to anyone who has perused the official USMC website.  The nutrition section was a major disappointment.  All it does is provide basic nutritional information that anyone who took Health in high school already knows.  The advice is very general, with obvious points such as "drink a lot of water" and "not all fats are bad" being common.    Some example meals and diet advice that is not common knowledge would have made this section worth including.  As is, it's a half-hearted attempt to fill pages.  The title of this book is "The Marine Corps Workout."  Of its 200-plus pages, only about 80 pages (the majority of which are oversized photos) are dedicated to the workout itself.  The sections on recruit and officer training do not count, because no attempt is made in those sections to show the reader how to do those exercises.  They are merely pictures of recruits in training for entertainment's sake.  The rest of the book is just filler to make it worth selling for ten bucks.  I think most of the people who rate this book highly are rating it merely on the basis of the Daily 16.  I give the workout itself five stars, but the Daily 16 routine is freely accessible on the Internet and not worth buying a book for.  Just google "daily 16" and see what I mean.  Outside of the workout, this is the kind of book you'd pick up off the library shelf, flip through for about 15 seconds, and put back.  You do not need to buy this disappointing book 
 This is one awful, awful book.  I hated it.  It was NOT funny, as I think he intended it to be, and it had no content value at all.  He is basically trying to sell his diary.  To be honest, I didn't finish it.  It didn't help me at all 
 I guess it all depends on what you want from a book about history. For me, a biography of someone who's already had any number of biographies really has to tell us something we didn't already know. This one doesn't. So I guess if you're the sort of person who's never seen another book about Robespierre, you'll find this story, well-told as it is, fascinating. But I could point you to five other books, some very old, that tell the same story just as well. And if some of the reviewers here can come away from it with the impression that Robespierre was "corrupt" in some material sense, then it really isn't making its central point of his "fatal purity" very clearly, is it 
 I enjoy Chef Kathleen's Food Network show.  And I thought that as someone who had lost a lot of weight, I would be able to get a lot of good ideas from her book.  The good about the book is that there are not too many ingredients per each dish, so most recipes are easy to make.  The bad is that serving sizes are not very clear in many recipes (the brisket recipe says it makes 10 servings with leftovers - how many leftovers? How do we know how much is base recipe and how much for leftovers if we don't know what a serving is?).  Also, she talks about the importance of calories on pages 8 - 10, and again on page 80, saying she likes to know exactly how many calories she's having for breakfast, but there are no calorie/nutrition counts for the recipes!  Perhaps she wants the emphasis to be on balanced diet, with good tasting food, but I frankly only wanted to read this book to get recipes with calorie counts.  Without those, this book was a real disappointment 
 What a disjointed collection of material. Did they even talk about Enterprise Architecture? No! This was my first book about Enterprise Architecture and it was so confusing on how it was written. Terrible. Don't get this one.  
 I don't ordinarily write reviews, but I feel the need to steer people away from spending money on this book!  This was a horrible waste of money, and of time spent in reading the first third or so I read before I quit.   Patricia Gunn Allen is not simply hooked on Political Correctness (which I could deal with).  She substitutes it for decent scholarship and for writing ability.  After the pointless detours into the legends of her own New Mexico Native American clan and 21st Century Physics, the attempt to relate the "myth" of Pochahontas to the Legend of one of the Kngihts of the Round Table (I think it was Gawain and the Green Knight, but I'm honestly not sure) did me in.  I wanted to know something about Pocahotas -- the Woman!  Or, as the title of the book says, the Medicine Woman, Spy,  Entrepeneur and Diplomat!  And that is what I could NOT glean from this book at all. 
 Kate and Jeffery are a comfortably married couple who aren't exactly happy with their mundane life. To remedy this, Kate goes on a retreat to a Tai Chi class and leave Jeffery with a Barbie-doll for an au pair named Natalie.  While away, Kate falls steadily in love with Ben (who is a flat, uninteresting character that Ms. Matthews just wants you to like because there's no one else around for Kate). While at home, Jefferey can't keep himself from lusting over Nat, who flirts like hell with a married man--sometimes--no, make that often--in front of his two kids.  The big spoiler is that both Kate and Jeffery have affairs. Kate has the best, most adventurous sex of her life and Jeffery gets to sleep with a woman who would never go for him.  In the end, there is no consequence for their actions. They keep their secrets, feel their passion renewed, and basically live happily ever after.   If you're all for adultery this could prove a worthwhile read, but if you want to see characters actually grow and change, skip this book. Kate was wishy-washy and whiny, her husband so dull you could skip over his chapters. If I could give zero stars, I really would have. I can't believe I finished it. 
 I was expecting more out of a plot that was set in the sleazy world of strippers and prostitution but this book was so superficial in its usage of this plot device that it would have been better to have chosen something different. The two protagonists are also not well-drawn though the heroine fared better than Hank, the hero. All throughout the book, he came across as boring and conservative - which did not gel with the author's description of him as an ex-Ranger AND a psychic. I mean, wow - as an ex-Ranger, Hank would have some back story but nothing is said about him. I didn't know what he was like, what events in his life shaped him into the man he is today, who his friends were and what drives him;  His whole character is made up of a guy who operates a martial arts school after being an ex-Ranger. He was like an inanimate object in the book at worst and at best, a Labrador seeing-eye dog. At least Jess had some emotional aspect to her but not much either. The annoying thing is that both the plot and the characters had so much potential.  For a much more satisfying police procedural, Karen Rose is much better bet because you'll get great romance and great characterisation. I haveLisle's I See You but after LGD, I did not feel like another Lisle 
 Good, flattering fit.  I'm 5'2" and I bought a short which was perfect and long enough to wear with heels, even a bit long actually.  Unfortunately when I washed them, they shrank 2" and now I have to wear them with flats.  I would buy them again, just in a longer length 
 Their basically what would happen if you took P.O.D's lyrics, and then added boring 1 chord riffs repeated throughout the whole song followed by the singer screaming the top of his head off about God and self-loathing in a noise-bleed inducing pre-pubescent girl voice, so you have a band so bad it makes God himself want to commit suicide. The song titles are also annoyingly bad, obviously made so they sound artistically genius (but instead monotonous).   And to everyone who thinks these guys are metal, they deserve to be buried alive. Metal is Fear Factory, Lamb of God, In Flames, and Arch Enemy. These guys are about as metal as Maroon 5. 
 NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)!  Not liking the negro portrayal in GONE WITH THE WIND,Alice Randall therefore created her own version, a parody of the acclaimed southern classic.Therein lies the problem.  The trouble with parodies,it so intertwind with the original that it can be used as a sequel,a retelling or a new story with characters copied from the original but this time superior while degrading the original.So much so,readers begin to accept these false truth as the true truth.Not openly but in disguise, words like "what if" & "perhaps".Why?Because people always like scandals to famous chracters fiction or not.When that happen, a novel,even w/ the purest intent and purpose,gets butchered.  Here are some cases to prove my point & where the book failed:  1.THE PARODY/CONCEPT ITSELF-The whole purpose of this book is to show negroes aren't dumb and capable.If you read GWTW,as others call it"White-washed"&"Romantized",is in fact a love story.Plus Mitchell was trying to show how a civilization changes after a war,what better way to illustrate it than the old south?  But why portray negroes like that? Obviously these fools didn't see Aunt Pitty,Hugh Elsing or Ashley.Aren't they white,helpless,pathetic and idiots?  If you read GWTW, What about the courageousness&modesty of Pork,The industriousness &loyalty of Dilcey?What about Uncle Peter who single handly raised Charles&Melanie,who looked after and Protected Aunt Pitty?What about Rhett and Scarlett declaring Mammy as a smart old soul?Aren't these persons Negro and admirable traits?  2.MAMMY KILLING THE 3 SONS-In p.663 GWTW, a yankee tells Scarlett "do you think i can trust my babies to a negro?" She thought otherwise,and now Mammy kills Gerald's sons.Its thesame as saying negroes can't be trusted and they kill white babies and Randall was trying to show Negroes in a different light.This damages her&the book's credibility.Noble as her intent,but no good can come out of evil means.Its better to kill 10 people than 1 baby,as the saying goes.  3.GERALD/MAMMY-Check the background story of Ellen/Gerald.There can be no doubt of his fidelity.It takes a great deal of emotion for a person to get unhinged after a loved one's death.  4.CYNARA-She is an exact copy of Scarlett even their ages are thesame but this time she smart,beautiful,brown,a good mother compared to Scarlett.She even has Scarlett's strength & Rhett even prefers her.Ridiculous!if Rhett likers her than Scarlett he would've married her instead,or divorce scarlett after he have is way with her,Rhett boast of being ill-bred so his rep. wont matter.Why this nonesense of mistress and after death marriage?  The book,despite being well-written,feels like a parasite after reading created by a first-time author who wants instant fame,fortune making others accept and embrace that her work is better while destroying others hard work. If you want a book about the attrocities of slavery then buy UNCLE TOM's CABIN which is BETTER than this one.  NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)! 
 Rick Pitino's book on how to overachieve in the business world is nothing that anybody with any common sense hasn't heard before.  The book was written because Pitino is trying to tell his story of his basketball career.  He will make a germane point with the first paragraph at the beginning of the chapter, and then will belabor the simple point into 20 pages.  This is a good book to read, buy you don't need to read the whole thing, you need to read the first few points of the chapter, where Pitino makes his point, and the summary of the main points at the end of the chapter, and you will learn just as much as somebody who read the whole book.  It is a decent piece of literature, but combined with a biography of Pitino's career makes the entire work way to redundant 
 I am suprised to see so many 5 star reviews. They must be friends with the author, or very ignorant. I just finished reading half of this text tonight (about 125 pages, over the course of a few months), and I plan to go no further with it. I was planning on finishing it but I just can't stand reading it. I skimmed the rest, finding the same drab boring text throughout. First off, the author is very cocky, and attempts to demonstrate his superior "level 3" attitude throughout the text. This can be very annoying to read. Second, the text is written as if it were a thesis. He makes -constant- references to other texts such as (Shmo, Software Engineering). Write something original already! Sometimes it's important to make references, but he makes so many of them that the text itself appears to me as just a collection of references. Further, several times throughout the text he makes...references to his own texts such as (Alistair, Crystal Clear). Not only that but he makes references to texts that he has not written yet! (e.g. Alistair, Text, forthcoming) Also, this text should perhaps be more accurately titled 'Analysis of Software Methodologies'. The first part of the text contains extremely generalistic fluff, where the author puts down the reader in so many subtle ways. The next part of the text provides an analysis of various practices that are used in methodologies, which is partially useful, but the text is written in such an annoying and undigestible manner that it gives me this sick feeling when reading it. The third part of the text provides examples of actual methodlogies, but is too general to be of any practical use. Despite not liking this text several dozen pages in, I made a real attempt at finishing it since I paid for it, but I just can't finish it. This text just doesn't work for me. I dislike the author's writing style and I would not recommend it to anyone.  From what I read so far, the useful portions of this text can be boiled down to a few HTML pages on a website.  This text is no 'masterpiece' as another reader put it. He must be friends with the author. If you're looking for a true masterpiece read The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas... a truly intelligent and practical text 
 This book has some merit, but does not add enough to the portrayal of Jesus in the gospels to make it deserving of more than two stars.  I liked Mailer's simple prose, which displays little of the show-offishness of The Fight, and the way in which he links the familiar events of the gospels, but otherwise I found the book slightly uninspirational. Jesus is portrayed as very human, and as grappling with the problem of how to handle his status of Son of God and the powers that go with it, but this is not a remarkable insight on the part of Mailer. I would think that anybody who has read the Bible with a sense of curiosity would have considered this as well 
 The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor.  That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on 
 As an engineer who both uses hydrogen and can work the math, I'm astonished that no one has corrected Peavey.  He mixes units, get equations wrong and just plain can't spell.  A decelerating engine is  "braking" not "breaking", for example.  His  thermodynamic computations are often wrong once you work them out, his  "borrowing" of other sources is painful where "propane"  was not changed to "hydrogen" is all cases in a paragraph.   Incredible.  This text is very nearly the "Anarchist's Cookbook"  of renewable energy -- there's a lot of words, some of it correct, but  someone's going to get badly hurt if they actually follow this guide.  All  that, and a decade out of date to boot. If Amazon would take the book back,  I'd gladly send them the ashes from the woodstove 
 Very little plot, which is boring. The reader should be paid by the page, if not by the word, to read this book! 
 The whole album was really bad. The group did not harmonize well on the ensemble songs. Tamyra screamed her way through Silent Night, a very mediocre version of Silver Bells, performed by Kimberley Locke and Clay Aiken. A boring I'll Be Home For Christmas, by Idol Wannabee, but charming, Justin Guarini had me falling asleep. And Winter Wonderland probably came close to being the worst on the album, but This Christmas, sung by Ruben Studdard beat it. Ruben's charm has disapeared since the show. The vocal performance itself was horrible, but as was the song. What ever happened to Traditional Christmas? I'll have to wait for Clay Aiken's Christmas Album to be released this October.    But the highlights are Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas - A duet by Tamyra Gray and Ruben Studdard, The Christmas Song sung by Kim Locke, and, the best, The First Noel, sung by Clay Aiken. Think I'm being biased towards Clay? By the album and see for yourself.     And of course Kelly was great. She tends to "scream" sometimes, but she did a good job on "Oh Holy Night and My Grown Up Christmas List - there are better versions then her out there, but Kelly is really a great singer 
 This is my first public review of any product. I generally dont have the time or motivation to go throught the process of posting a review. However, I have never had such a negative experience with a commercially available software package before. From beginning to end, the process of repeated attempts to install and then trying to remove NIS2007 was time-consuming, frustrating, and crippled my computer.   First the operating environment details. I'm running XP-Pro SP2 on a 2.6ghz pentium with 1GB of RAM.   Upon the de-installation of the existing NIS 2006 and Spyware Doctor applications, I proceeded with the installation of NIS 2007. The installation appeared to go cleanly, but upon attempting to restart, my computer hung on shutting down, and upon attempting to come up, I got a blank desktop with no task bar, start menu, or desktop icons. Later, as I was working with Symantec support and was able to get a desktop back, I also experienced things as not being able to bring up the control panel or click on the 'My Computer' icon. Of course, I had no internet access during the whole ordeal.   Since I couldnt find any phone number contact in the ridiculously minimal instruction manual that came with the package, I called my local ISP to find out what they knew about the affects of using NIS 2007. Through them I got a phone number for Symantec support. As a side note, the manual points out ways to get support if you have access to the internet and email, but gives no direction if you dont have access to those.   Over the course of the next 4 days of working through my issues with NIS 2007, my experience with Symantec support left me with the impression that they were mostly incompetent and quite innefective. I give Symantec credit for having 24/7 phone support, and I did work with one knowledgable support person there named Jay, but most of the experience was frustrating and time-consuming. The help desk is located in India, and the first problem is that they couldnt hear me though I was speaking loudly. The next problem is that I had to answer the same questions repeatedly as if the person didnt understand my answers. On a number of ocassions, I felt the person on the other end was just going through a script, and wasnt listening to what I was saying or reading my growing case notes. I got passed around a lot to different people and spent a lot of time on hold. They kept trying to get me off the phone even though we hadnt worked through the problem completely. In one instance, the helpdesk person was trying to tell me that things were all fixed even when I had told her there was an activation error during the re-install we were working on.   Having worked with tech support and edited registries, and tinkered with start-up configurations and various services settings, I could never get NIS 2007 to install (tried four times). Trying to un-install the package turned out to be almost as difficult and troublesome. Uninstalling has left me with problems with my computer I have yet to work out. I still cant use my scanner because it complains about a symantec DLL issue. I have no idea why that would be.   Anyway, I would rate this product less than zero if I could. There was nothing that went right, and a lot that went wrong. I cant believe Symantec could put out such a pathetic piece of software with such inffective support. I'm returning NIS 2007 and trying my luck with Zone Alarm.  
  I did not like this film, surprising to me because I have liked all the other films in which Daniel Craig appeared, after I saw him for the for the first time in Casino Rayale. Also, the copy of the film which I bought used hat many black spots in it, a first for any used products I have ordered from Amazon 
 My mother and father read this book and it enflamed them against the doctors who were trying to convince my mother that she needed to do something about her Stage II breast cancer.  She was scared to death by what she read.  Perhaps literally.  While she was scared, her cancer progressed to Stage IIIC.  We're not sure she's going to make it.  She received three opinions regarding recommended treatment from some of the best hospitals/doctors in the U.S.  Then the cancer spread to her breast bone area.  She is finally following doctors orders, including chemo, and her tumors are shrinking.  We pray it is not too late.  I'm sure this book has some useful information, but my mother only showed me the scary bits--the things that made her wait.  Too long?  Who knows.  Beware 
 This movie should not be named "Final Terror", but should be named "Final Joke" instead because it sucks so bad.  First of all, I'm not one to criticize DVD transfers, but the picture quality is horrible with this DVD.  Second, this movie lacks cohesiveness and dexterity.  The scenes do not move well from one scene to the next...the movie has no fluidity and almost zero character development.  Also, there is ZERO suspense in this movie and no scares whatsoever...the directing is horrible as well because all of the scenes come off looking generic and wooden.  This movie lacks substance and style, and when I saw the killer, I burst out laughing because it was such a joke.  Despite some decent actors in this movie like Rachel Ward and Daryl Hannah, the movie fails in almost every respect.  The kills are lame when you can see what's going on, the production values are very poor and there is virtually no theatrical structure to this movie...it just does not flow well.  I wish I had not bought this trash, but I am on a mission to see every horror movie and I obviously have just about seen them all if I am looking to this kind of trash to find some decency in the obscurity of B-movie horror.  
 Don't waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch.  This monitor is sold as "providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout".  Since you have to stand still to get an accurate reading one has to wonder what type of workout Reebok did to substantiate this claim.  Get a strapped monitor for working out.  While this is a great idea the design doesn't match the intended purpose 
 As a passive individual, I live through the words and  experiences of first hand authors for my adventure. This narrative simply scratches the surface of those before it. "Ship of Gold", "The Fatal North" and "Abandon Ship!" come to mind immediately as adrenaline rush examples.   Any of the several publications on "The Endurance" far exceed the expectations of "Deep Blue".   The human spirit has greater tales to tell 
 This book is a poorly-written cry of a book.  Don't wate your time 
 Not as good as the Dummies series which has better written and illustrated books on this subject 
 I must not have read the same book as the other people who reviewed this because I got nothing out of this book but a huge panic attack!  It made me all stressed out and wasn't helpful in the least!  I take that back, I learned one thing from the book -- the real name and origin of the wedding march.  If you want to have a simple wedding and just want a book that will give you the breakdown of what is what DON'T buy this book -- instead, buy "Weddings for Dummies" THAT is a great reference 
 The book is easy to follow, and can help a non-programmer pick up the basics.  The problem is in the code examples.  The code examples in this book all compile, and the binaries run, but if you enable warnings on your ANSI-compliant compiler before compiling any of this code, you will see a whole host of warnings and error messages.  Don't think that you will learn C from this book and then go get a job somewhere as a C programmer.  Your code will be as non-ANSI compliant as it could possibly be while still working.  This makes it even more difficult if you progress to a more advanced C text after this, as you will likely have to go back and relearn quite a bit.  I give it 5 stars for ease of use, but it loses 3 stars for not "teaching good programming practices" as it claims to on the cover 
 I have one question. What's so great about taking 12 years to do what most serious art collectors do in one telephone call 
 This accessory system does not fit my Kohlcraft umbrella stroller.  I can find a place to put the parent cupholder, but there is no place at all to put the child's snack tray.  The stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller.  The whole purpose of spending the money on this "system"  (which was considerably more expensive than others in the store) was for my child to have a snack tray.  Therefore, it's going back to the store.  There are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this... even the Prince Lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive...   The product itself is also very cheaply made.  The "s" hooks look so flimsy I wouldn't trust them... again, they sell thicker, sturdier "s" hooks that look like they will work much better than this, so that's what I'll purchase.  Plus, the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy... already the "arms" have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter!      Thirdly, I'm not sure if it was the "clips" that came in my packet (perhaps a defect) or if they are all made this way... but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips... and then they didn't fasten correctly.  No matter how I tried (I worked on it for close to an hour and I consider myself pretty good at these things!), I could not get the clips to tighten properly.  They continued to be loose... even with using the smaller screws.  Perhaps my stroller tubing is "too small"??? Very unlikely, but it just might be the case.    This is going back to the store, where I will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for $5, a package of two (thick) "s" hooks for $3 and my child will have to learn to "deal" with holding her snack cup and straw cup.  I will save myself $10, a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly, and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items!!!  Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this product!!! 
 The book's extensive documentation of homosexuality in animals may be valuable, but the book's style doesn't leave me with much confidence that its interpretations of the research are sufficiently unbiased to be relied upon.  The book's discussions of why it is hard to provide an evolutionary explanation of homosexuality are mostly reasonable, but the alternative to evolution that the book proposes isn't sufficiently well thought out to qualify as a testable scientific hypothesis. Evolutionary theory has a good enough track record at explaining things that appear at first glance to be counterproductive that people shouldn't reject it without finding an alternative with a good deal of explanatory power. But exuberance is an idea which explains very little. And anyone who has made impartial observations of typical natural ecosystems should see that the extravagance and waste that the book worships are sufficiently uncommon as to be hard to reconcile with the book's characterization 
 This was a very unscriptural movie, and a very poor portrayal of King David. It was a waste of time. Professional production work and big name actors do not a good movie make. Maybe Hollywood has its own way of viewing things, but when making a movie of a written text as well known as this one, it is better to stick to what the text says. David did not scrabble on the ground for stones for his sling during the battle with Goliath, he collected them ahead of time. The affair with Bathsheba was at his idea and initiation, not hers. He did NOT have a tantrum when God told him he could not build the temple. Enough said 
 First off, I have never thaught I would give Gilgamesh anything less than five stars. However, I recently received Andrew George's translation (the more reccent translation in the Penguin Classics series) and earlier today got my hands on a copy of this edition and decided to compare them. I found this edition very incomplete (George's is currently the most complete form) and like another reviewer said an unneccisarilly long introduction (at least for a translation that short). So while I do recomend Gilgamesh to everybody I would not recomend this (N. K. Sandars) translation and would instead recomend the one by Andrew George (unless you want more myths from Babylon and that area in which case I would recomend Myths From Mesopotamia by Stephanie Dalley her translation while not as complete is still one of the best I've read) 
 Quinn Marlowe's hope of having a real life shatters shortly after a strange conversation with her friend, Alicia Morrow, in which the other woman makes little sense and seems focused on ospreys. A little while later, Alicia is found dead right outside Quinn's cottage, and the former Justice Department agent is determined to find out what happened. She does not believe that Alicia killed herself. As her investigation begins, Quinn becomes congnizant of the fact that she herself is being watched by Huck McCabe, an alleged guard at the Breakwater, a  high security complex in Quinn's area. In actuality, he's much more, an undercover operative searching for a band of killers.  As their investigations are apparently connected, the two team up to battle a giant.    ** The oddball start strikes a discordant note that makes it quite problematic to get involved in the story. Characterization is somewhat lacking, though the plot is replete with action. Ms. Neggers fans will likely enjoy this, but it won't win new ones. **   Amanda Killgor 
 I cannot believe the high marks for this book. This book purports to be a management manual and a historical view of Alexander's life. It is quite mediocre on both fronts. The historical side is full of inaccuracies and the management side is far too simplistic to have any real value. If one is interested in reading about Alexander's military genius I would recommend The Generalship of Alexander the Great J.F.C. FULLER 
 You would not think that a book concerning Fetish trends etc would put you to sleep but this book will. You may nod awake for the photos but the text is a mish-mosh of psycho-drivel, unrelated and uninteresting facts and  sketchy history 
 I was really disappointed when this item arrived.  It is cute and well made, but barely holds a pound of pasta.  This is more suited for single servings or wall decor, but I wanted a large heavy duty colander.  Oh well 
 I love this show!  That said, I do not care for this version of it.  The inclusion of the word "concept" in the title means it is just that.  This was, thankfully, not the final version of the show that would later spawn the hit song, "One Night In Bangkok".  With most Broadway musicals, the musical numbers tell the basic story of the show.  If you listen to the recordings of Phantom, Mama Mia, Beauty and the Beast, you can discern the basic storyline of the show.  Listening to this particular recording of Chess, though, will leave you wondering "What was that?"  The Broadway arrival of Chess saw a much needed reworking of the storyline and arrangement of the musical numbers.  This recording seems too much like a mish-mash of songs that don't really relate to each other.  For musical fanatics (like myself), I say "yes, you should have this recording in your collection", if only to understand how much work went into the show before it opened on Broadway.  If you are only buying the album because of "One Night In Bangkok", purchase the Broadway recording instead; you'll be much happier with the performance by Phillip Casnoff rather than Murray Head 
 i don't know to whom this book the author wrote. If you are a beginner, you must be confuse read it but if you are not a beginner again u won't get nothing from this book.There is no tip or trick. Trade for a living far better than this boo 
 The author spends so much time trying to be "precious" and "clever" that his narrative is confusing. Where am I? In England? America? Who am I reading about? Huh? Going back a few pages didn't help.  A total disappointment 
 I was recommended Borges' works by one of his innumerable over-educated sycophants and I will never forget the tremendous time I wasted attempting to grasp the supposed value of his life's work (when I should have been writing my dissertation). Each time I read one of his pedantic, mediocre peices of short fiction, I was convinced by these elite book review troglodytes that I would like other examples of his work if I continued reading since "all of his stories are so unique." I found the exact opposite to be true. One story after another about mazes, mirrors, mystical mathematical formulas and books, books, books. The ideas were transperant, the language boring in the extreme. His poetry is trite. Who needs this? Borges reads like a petulant graduate student at University of Chicago who failed repeatedly to get his/her short fiction published in _The Atlantic Monthly_. Particularly among academics, literary elites and like people, many seem to cite Borges and worship his genius more than read him--and certaintly _no one_ reads him critically. I read most of his work, and I can tell you, outside of a few interesting turns of phrase, you'd be better off reading a Yale dissertation on the semiotics of self-superiority. People incessantly talk about how imaginative Borges is. The vast majority of popular SF and fantasy writers are more imaginative. Even many of the despicable magical realist "geniuses" make Borges look rather plain. Borges merely litters his works with elite literary references and a kind of faculty cocktail party wit to make it more palatable to the kind of people who never step foot out of Manhattan or Cambridge. If you're this kind of pompous fellow, you'll want to sleep every night with a portrait of Luis by your side and a series of mirrors, as it were, slowly attempting to seek some kind of trans-substantiation with this benighted old librarian. If you're the kind of person who prefers reading about interesting characters, enjoying nuanced use of language, and grasping subtle, daring ideas that transcend purile academic banter, run far, far away from Jorge Luis Borges. Even top authors from all over the world and every historical period get bad reviews. The adulation of Borges merely underlines the fact that this is more about a cult of personality among (those who think themselves) intellectual elites than a serious attempt to evaluate his fiction. I think his fiction is better considered a kind of academic experiment, relegated to quirky local fiction publications and coffee house poetry slams, and not an example of literary genius. In that sense, 30min spent on one of his short stories gets you the drift of his entire body of work, and that's about as much attention as he deserves 
 I was very much disappointed with this album.I really didn't need to hear of all their problems in life.I did not purchase this album to hear them talk about themselves, I wanted to hear their music, which on this album there is very little. I am sending this album back to Amazon. Stay away if you are looking for music. 
 32 years ago I was so stoked that Clapton was finally coming out with a new album, I walked five miles to Deorsey's Records in Lewiston, Maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record. The still near virgin vinyl remains in my LP collection and has only been played once. Once was enough. Heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness, inspiration and technical ability. Sad. 
 Mr. Ferrazzi ignores the distinct advantage that he has had throughout his career: he is an Ivy-league grad.  While I found some of his insights to be helpful, he glosses over his educational background as though he presumes that all of his readers come from privileged upbringings.  While he attempts to diffuse his obvious advantages by opening with a discussion of his working-class roots, Mr. Ferrazzi loses steam on the very next page, writing about all of the the great schools he attended and the fact that he caddied at a country club. Caddying at a country club is not a degrading, confidence-busting job for a kid, working as a cashier at CVS is.  How does the CVS kid network his way out?  In one point in the book, Mr. Ferrazzi creates a lot of build up about an event he attended and how much anxiety he felt.  The big denouement was that he had a connection through Yale.  This is not compelling.  I was expecting him to have had to actually overcome something.  There are some good insights in the book, but few that I hadn't heard before.  I'm not sure that this book has shed any light on anything aside from the advantages of belonging to ivy-league networks 
 As a first time mother, I was looking for a book that would answer my seemingly endless list of questions. While this book does provide some good information, it is hard to decipher the facts from the sarcastic comments and attempts at wit. Every section and statement is worded in what I assume the author saw as a clever way, but after trying 5 or 6 topics, I gave up trying to get any useful information. If you're like me and are looking for a more straight-forward, well-researched book, try Your Pregnancy Week by Week by Glade B. Curtis. It is by far the best organized and most clearly worded pregnancy book I have read - having tried The Pregnancy Bible, What to Expect (too cynical and scary), as well as The Mother of all Pregnancy Books. 
 "Voices from the Street" is supposedly a study of one man's descent into madness, a subject that fans of Dick know well. This novel however doesn't work, and it shows that publishers are scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Dick spends a lot of time developing the secondary characters and never gives more than passing glimpses of what is happening inside the main character's head. Once the character does snap, Dick rushes through it to get to the overly long epilogue.  From a writer's perspective, Dick learned a lot from writing this novel, primarily that insane characters are more interesting after the onset than before, and plot structures and themes of his later books derived great benefits from this experiment.  Therein lies any insight that fans of Dick can get from this book. The author uses several different approaches in writing about a character who is losing it. For the most part, these techniques either fail or offer mediocre results, and to the best of my knowledge, I do not remember Dick using them in his later books with characters with impaired cognition. Compare "Voices from the Street" with "A Scanner Darkly" (ignoring of course the SF elements of the latter) and notice how the development in ASD is so much richer and focused. Notice too how the secondary characters support the plot rather than usurping it.  As an unpublished novel, VFTS is still a pivotal novel between Dick's early work and that of his middle and late career. It shows an author honing his craft, but it is more like looking in an artist's sketchbook rather than admiring a masterpiece. Casual fans of Dick will not miss anything by skipping over this book. 
 Although I have enjoyed Robert Ludlum in the past (Bourne Identity, among others) this is the most cliché-ridden piece of novelistic junk food I have ever had the displeasure to read -- well, partly read, since I couldn't even finish it. One stereotypical, unrealistic character after another. One stereotypical, unrealistic line of dialogue after another. I highly recommend that you do not bother to read this book: if you want a thriller, try Echo Park by Michael Connelly or Lost by Michael Robotham 
 Product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery.  As of 1/29/07 it has not been taken off my credit card.  How would you rate my review 
 If you know absolutely nothing about Spain, this could be a nice book to very lightly acquaint you with the Spainish culture.  It definitely does not live up to it's description.  It touches on (one paragraph) many different topics, many of which I would have liked to know more about but just read about what I already know.  It's not horrible, just basic.  It most definetly does not prepare one for a trip to Spain or if you plan to move there(as I am doing).  For example, it tells you there are comprehensive bus and train systems...I need to know their names and how to use them.(of course they have them, anyone would assume that)  For me this was a waste of time and money 
 I found this book very superficial for the most part. An exploration of George's spirituality is an interesting subject, but  there were so many errors in this book that I began to question what was fact or or fiction in discussions of George's spiritual life 
 I was looking forward to using this cookbook as the idea of preparing dinner early in the day and having it ready and waiting for me at six o'clock was extremely appealing.  However, I have been extremely disappointed.  All the entrees I have tried have been, in my opinion, overcooked.  Sadly, I am coming to the conclusion that most foods were not meant to be cooked 6-7 hours.  Most of the recipes I tried were a bland mushy mess and there is not one that I would subject my family to again.  My last and final attempt was the Chicken with Beer which was both dry (due to the required baking for 20 minutes in the oven after 3 to 4 hours in the slow cooker on high) and tasteless.  Much to my amazement, one prior reviewer actually liked this recipe!  So maybe its just me.  In any case I am considering givin the slow cooker to Goodwill, along with this cookbook.  There has got to be a better way to simplify the chaos of dinner time preparation 
 The first time I used this item, I used Ghirardelli Baking Chips. I had to add a lot of oil to get any kind of sheeting which made the chocolate taste horrible. The second time, I spent a lot of money on professional fountain chocolate (Sephra brand) with a high cocoa butter content. The results weren't much better. It seems that there are two possible problems with the design of this fountain. Either the chocolate isn't kept hot enough or the auger doesn't "pump" fast enough. The melted chocolate seemed to be coming out of the top of the fountain very well. It looks runny enough and sheets down the top shaft nicely. But by the time it gets to the first "fall", it seems to be running way too slow to form a continuous sheet. By the time it falls from the last level, it's just dripping 
 I missed the book club meeting that discussed this book but thought I would read the book anyway because everyone seems so enamoured with Ms. Cleage.  I read the first 150 pages of this book and I am bored to tears.   All of the reviews call this book astonishing; did the reviewers read the 1st 150 pages--nothing, absolutely NOTHING interesting happens in these pages.  Even if the author made up for it in the last 150 pages, this book could not be an astonishing book.  I will not be reading anymore Cleage books.  I, however, will try to finish reading this one since I started it.  My hopes for some excitement in the book,however, has been shattered by the other reviewers who state that the book doesn't even have excitement at the end of the book 
 I just finished this book and i don't really know if I liked the book overall. The book is too shallow, the story is just so so. There is nothing really exciting about the book. This is the first Lisa Kleypas book that I've read and I really rely in the ratings of the readers of course depending on the story also before I buy a book. This book have a good rating and definitely have a nice start to the story but after reading it, I am not having second thoughts about her books. I have other books of Lisa Kleypas and now I am hesitating to read them. 
 I was attracted to this book by its cover, so I pre-ordered it. After waiting 3+ months past the release date (Feb 6, 2006) it finally arrived in early May. Wow, what a disappointment!  I was expecting some upscale professional design ideas for handbag embellishment. Instead, the ideas in this book are very cutsey-poo and childish.  The only nice design is on the cover. These designs might be appropriate for very young girls (faux fur, poodle appliques, felt cat with rhinestones, pom-poms, costume jewelry decorations, etc) but not for the sophisticated handbag creator.  A better choice for elegant handbag embellishment would be Stephane Kimura's BAGS WITH STYLE, or Barbara Weilands new book SEW EASY DESIGNER BAGS & TOTES. 
 I cannot agree with previous reviewers that this cd is in the same class as "Blow By Blow" or "Wired". Sorry, Jeff, this is lame. Sometimes you just need to know when to hang up the axe 
 Don't waste your money. I bought this book and read it cover to cover without gleaming an ounce of useful information. Firstly it is primarily geared towards women, not much useful in there for us guys. That being said unless you are a 5 year old girl or have been kept in a box your entire life, all the suggestions are plain and simple common sense. The book has numerous stories of Bev Bacons' encounters with dates. There is absolutely nothing funny or out of the ordinary about her dates. It just goes to show that no one is perfect. As one would think the ultimate goal of Internet dating is to find a long term partner I was left wondering why the author spent so many years dating. Maybe it is her that has a problem! The only useful information that I took home from reading the book I gained from reading between the lines. This is that the internet will attract those who like "shopping" for their dates. So if you meet someone who loves shopping run away, run away, because next week when you are out of fashion they will be back on the internet looking for something bigger and better. Alternatively if you are out of work consider doing the same as the author, write a book about common sense things to do, then spend a year dating normal people and write a book about it, then con loads of people into buying it 
 One of the most ridiculous pieces of minimalist trash out there. It just goes to show you where a lot of time, a lot of money, popular culture, and a twisted world view have landed so much of American. Don't waste your time or your money on this. 
 I did not buy this book, but gave it a cursory review. Some reviewers complained about some absurd examples that this book uses. I think the problem is that the authors wrote this book as if the readers were all going to be dummies. It is common sense that anyone who is interested in an in-depth study of any subject, or anyone who just wants to try to understand the basics of a subject, will not buy a book with such an inappropriate title. In any case, I have been studying grammar for a while and the best books available for studying grammar are The Grammar Bible by Strumpf, The Elements of Style by White, and Grammar Smart by Princeton Review. The difference between these books the one written for "dummies" is that the authors don't beat around the bush with useless stories and sentences to try to retain the reader's attention; instead, all their comments are incisive, insightful, and very interesting. And let's face it, if you are not so interested in grammar, you might still buy this book for dummies but it's unlikely that you'll ever end up reading, or retaining (which is more important), the information contained within the book. In my opinion, anyone who wants to learn grammar but doesn't want to spend too much time on it is far better off getting a book that is as succinct as possible. Here is a hint: just the usage of the myriad of extra words in this book for dummies is already a bad lesson in grammar. It teaches one to use many unnecessary words, whereas an author like White relentlessly emphasizes the importance of brevity. His book so small that one can put it in a pocket, yet the information contained within the book is anything but too little 
 If you are looking for the text book for this course you are looking at the wrong book. All the reviews listed under this book speak glowingly of Feldman's approach to the subject but unless you are careful you will miss that they are talking about the hard cover textbook. This study guide may be helpful but only if you have the full text. Beware what you are buying 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 I don't know why, but this album not only does nothing for me, listening to it actually irritates me in that the songs are so bland and long.  I do love "The Ballad Of Peter Pumpkinhead" and "The Smartest Monkeys" is listenable, but the rest is precious and dull.  XTC is a band I root for because I do feel they should have reeped more benefits from their music career than they have.  Their chance at a hit song was crushed when the bible belt banned their masterpiece, "Dear God", from the radio and they have never released albums that are "current".  I am glad they moved on to the aound of Venus Apple, it is all potential, but hopefully newcomers to XTC's music stay away from this one.  XTC deserves to at least make a living from their brilliant music.  I will keep my fingers crossed that albums like English Settlement, Drums and Wires, The Black SEa, Skylarking, The Big Express will bring new fans and if not they are able to make brilliant music in the future that broadens their audience. 
 As an active duty chaplain in the military I had a significant interest in chapter 9, Priests and Padres.  First, I was amazed at the number of references and her ability to read, organize, and synthesize them into a narrative.  These references, however, are derived from a significant number of ministers writings or sermons, which became the framework for her conclusions.  Furthermore, multiple references, representing several wars, are devoid of their cultural-historical context and woven into one sentence or paragraph leaving the reader to think the behavior, concept, or issue is timeless and characteristic of clergy.  I don't consider the chapter a valid historical analysis because of the limitations of the source material.  What the chapter does provide is a summary of her sources convictions and behaviors-which is not the whole story.  Since I considered her conclusions in chapter 9 highly subjective I did not read the rest of the book 
 It has few really nice photos to view over and over again but that's about it and after you flip thru some actual lamp pages you begin to wonder... I don't see any plans or projects offered by this book as it has only photograhs of rooms with lights on. Don't waste your money on this 
 Marcus Borg has given good scholarly effort and quality research to this book.  The format is reader-friendly and has some good thought provoking statements from both Jesus and Buddah.  All of this being said, spiritual seekers should use much caution in reading this book. I am a follower of Jesus Christ, He has transformed my life which is something no one, including myself, could do.  In his introductory remarks Mr. Borg calls himself a "non-exclusive" Christian, which to me is contradictory to Jesus' remarks in John 14:6 where He says, "I am the way, the truth and the life no one comes to the Father except by me."   It is for this reason that I give the book 2 stars and didn't finish it 
 I have always been a fan of Sony because they make quality products that are "user-friendly".  That is why I was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by Sony, because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture.  First the bad...the control buttons (sound, changing tracks, pause, etc) are tiny and nearly impossible to read.  I found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button, and I do not have any vision problems.  The little lcd screen is hard to read as well.  Next, the sound quality is poor and has a cheap "watered down" feel to it.  Then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with.  These are cheap and don't fit well.  I bought a yellow "psyc" sony walkman a couple years ago, and that one is 3 times the product that this one is.  The sound is near-perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use.  The headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all.  I wouldn't write sony off simply b/c of this product, but I would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them.  
 Be careful, this runs REALLY small.  I got the 18-24 for my 14 month old, and it would fit better on an average 6 month old.  Otherwise, it seems of nice quality 
 This book is a bore. Middle class English in the 60s. Everything that needs to be said has been said. Why bring this subject back up in the 1990s. Another English writer who writes beautifully but unfortunately, has nothing to say 
 Having avoided seeing this film, I found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on, brought "Tuesday..."unbiden into our home.My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film.Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, "Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie."In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely.The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr.Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.I,for one, think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial. Then pull the finger out, and just get on with it.(To the grammar and form police: I did have this in paragraphs, but the editing process scrunched it all together. Sorry 
 That is my advice after listening to this. The first song "Collide" is common on radio, etc. I like it. I'd say he takes second to Ryan Cabrera in the battle of male alternative singers. Highlight of the CD is Sara Overall - very talented. Two more good songs.  Guide to the songs below. 1. Collide - Howie Day  -We like -4.5 stars 2. I Will Learn To Love Again - Kaci (club beats, boring, give it up girl!) - 0 stars  3. Better Than This - Kimberley Locke  -not my cup of tea, but a strong voice. 2 stars. 4. Real Life Fairytale - Plumb  -Interesting, enchanting...-3.5 stars 5. Let It Go - Jadon Lavik  -who IS this?? 4 stars  6. The Real Thing - Sara Overall  -BEST of the CD. 6 Stars!  7. If You Got What You Came For - Beth Thornley -2 stars (ungirly rock) 8. Make Room - Grits  0 Stars (rap) 9. Mr. Roboto (Live) - Dennis DeYoung ---  10. Lady (Live) - Dennis DeYoung  ------- (1 Star. Yuck. Old) 11. Babe (Live) - Dennis DeYoung  ------- 12. Best Of Times (Live) - Dennis DeYoung --   Thankfully, they kept duff OFF this soundtrack, because I don't think it could take more damage. Get Howie's CD, wait for Sara's(the rest are even BETTER) , find out if you like Jadon or Plum, and don't buy the soundtrack! :)That's what I'm doing 
 ...HE HAS TO SHOW HIS ''THIS IS WHAT DEATH LOOKS LIKE'' FACE ON THE COVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! bob is no musical genius (no ''O'' in genius,people !!!!!!!!) but he is a genius exploiter.he duped a generation of hippies into believing his junk.its been said before,put some other drunk guys name on any of bobs cds and not one person would buy it.except for tom waits but that goes without saying 
 I purchaced this product because its a great idea.  The problem is it only runs when the sun is shining on the solar panel. Also there is not enough suction to get the hot air out. Also the product does not sit on the window firmly and can fall off if you open your window.  Hopefully they can take this design an improve the suction and maybe add a battery. Similar to the solar lights you put in your driveway 
 How High is a film that lends nothing, I repeat, nothing to the film community at large.  I have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the Cheech & Chong of the new millennium with the Redman/Method Man pairing.  While most seem to agree that this is a horrible film, very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be.  When I use the word racist, I mean that it builds upon the degenerate clichï¿½s that African Americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society.  While there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring, what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing Method Man and Redman must be to both the film community, but also to their own culture.  I have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films, but this one left my jaw on the floor several times.  The blatant swings at African American stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director Jesse Dylan, but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face.  Humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype clichï¿½s that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film.  Nothing was original.  Nothing was exciting.  Was the pairing of Redman and Method Man an idea of comedic proportions?  I think not.  As you can tell from their short lived series after the release of this film, the corporate world wanted to cash in on these two rappers, but soon realized that they were not as bankable as they thought.  Why?  Method Man and Redman, who completely different people, were nothing more than the same character in this film.  With the very subtle hints of Method Man being smarter, nothing could separate the equality of these two characters.  That is why they failed as a comic team.  Think of Matthau and Lemmon or the above example of Cheech & Chong, what made these teams work while the How High team crashed and burned?  What worked the best were the differences that uniquely drew the pair together.  Their differences made us laugh and sympathetically brought them together, but with Method Man and Redman, they were the same.  I was watching the same two characters fight through the same two challenges in this film. What tried to be funny instead transformed into repetitive.  What Dylan did to counter the similarity between Redman/Method Man was bring in obscure secondary characters that added nothing to the flimsy plot or helped us feel emotion for our two main characters.  The clichï¿½ jock, the clichï¿½ frat boy, the clichï¿½ Asian (which was again another racist moment), and the clichï¿½ rich white boy, just felt and were old.  Watch college films from the 70s and you will see these same combinations, but what makes the films from the 70s different is that they used them with originality.  How High, from beginning to end, was anything but original.  I must admit, after watching this film of which Harvard was willing to loan their name to, I don't want to go to Harvard.  They should have pondered the effects this film would have upon their prestige heritage.  How High is a dark spot in Harvard's history.  Do you know what makes it even worse?  This film wasn't even created at or anywhere near Harvard.  Again, Dylan was cutting corners to create a false sense of realism that continued to hurt this film.  How High has no redeeming qualities.  Ooops, I stand corrected.  The only smile that was ever created on my face during this film was when Spalding Gray spoke.  How did they get him and Fred Willard to do this film?  I have said it once, I will say it again, some actors just need their bills paid.  Inconsistency, incompetence, and aggravation seemed to be the hidden themes of this dud.  What destroyed this film further is that if you take the actors away and look at the story in general, it is nothing.  There is no original story at all with How High.  Going to college, working for your grades, winning over the heart of the President right at the last minute - this was nothing short of a "cut and paste" film that had no backbone and horrid acting!  I do not like Jesse Dylan's style of directing.  While I think Kicking and Screaming is his prized film (due greatly to Will Ferrell), all of his films seem to be extremely choppy with the editing and are randomly interjected with an overdose of unnecessary scenes.  The John Adams scene in How High is a prime example.  The Benjamin Franklin moments is another.  The unconcluded "Truth Serum" can be considered another.  How High was just scene after scene of inconsistency.  Lumpy oatmeal would win first place before this film would ever be congratulated!  I blame a majority of the issues with this film on Jesse Dylan.  If he would have tightened the script, created unique and "cult-like" characters, and eliminated the racism, he may have had the quintessential "weed" film in Hollywood.  Now, all he has is a violent case of the munchies and nothing to show for.  Sad.  Overall, this was one of the worst films that I have witnessed.  Never have I been so emotionally charged about the racist moments in this film as I have with How High.  The actors, all around, were horrible.  The story had no legs to stand on and it became very obvious after the opening credits that unless you were either 10 to 15 years of age, this film would never be considered a comedy.  Nothing was funny.  Nothing will make you laugh.  The only part worth enjoying in this film is the ending credits.  The ending credits give you a chance to walk away and forget this part of your cinematic life.  Grade: * out of **** 
 its about as unarousing as an hour of 2 completely naked women can be, and i doubt anyone can learn anything from this video either 
 I am a first-time mother and was trying to find a book to give me some insight on my available birthing options.  I had hoped that this book would give me the non-judgemental information on both a natural and a medicated birth.  What I got instead, is a book that is so severly biased towards natural birth that the hospital birth scenario described makes you believe that it is down-right dangerous to give birth to your infant in a hospital setting using an "evil" ObGyn.  The authors try to throw in statements that make you not feel like a monster for thinking about using drugs in your birthing plan, but the attempts are incredibly feeble and in the end you do feel like a monster for considering it.  For example, a mother that chooses medical pain relief to assist her labor "places little value on experiencing the birth process itself".  In addition, "High-tech solutions to pain often take away more than the pain itself".  But if you decide to give birth in a pool of water in your living room, you are somehow naturally a mother.    If it would have been presented as a book that was obviously one geared for natural childbirth I would have been fine with the presentation of material, but it's billed as one that will give you information on all the options.  Needless to say, I am greatly disappointed at the bias presented in this book.   
 My pastor recommended this book and for the life of me I cannot figure out why.  I've read other articles by Jack Hayford in the past and he's one of the few charismatics who's scholarship I had some respect for.  No more.  This book is based almost exclusively on human experience and contains very little exegetcial content.  He interprets God's Word in the light of human experience instead of vice versa.  He doesn't define his terms, he comes to his argument assuming the legitimacy of tongues speaking today and doesn't make a Biblical case for it as I was hoping.  He claims that every instance of gibbersh tongues speaking is a known earthly language.  According to Hayford, because there are more than 6,000 known languages on the planet and no one person could possibly identify all of them; therefore if we don't recognize the gibberish it must be a known language that we are just unfamiliar with.  What kind of logic is that?  He also conveniently forgets the requirement for a tongues speaker to either have an interpreter present or to be quiet.   His assumption that even though we may not know the language we're supernaturally speaking, that we are somehow edified apart from understanding, without dealing with Paul's major thrust in I Cor. 12-14 on insisting that nothing be done apart from understanding because it would be of no value without it.  A typical charistmatic approach...long on anecdotal evidence, very short on exegesis.  I'm sure Rev. Hayford is very well meaning, but don't waste your money on this book 
 This book gives just a general overview of cat care.  It is good if you have never owned a cat before and need just general info.  I was disappointed because it didn't give many specifics on Persian cats 
 I watched this movie and I have no idea what it was about. Admittedly it had the usual post-modern, post-Matrix action movie tropes, improbably gorgeous protagonists dressed in tight clothing doing impossible things (I'm a big fan of Charlize Theron in a sheer body suit), lots of explosions, a vast, behind the scenes conspiracy (well, that's kind of redundant, most conspiracies are 'behind the scenes) run by evil bad guys and futuristic storm troopers who are so bad with their firearms that they make the Imperial Storm Troopers in Star Wars look like Marine snipers, but other than that what was this movie about? It's as if the producers decided to take a bunch of these tropes, throw them up against the wall, see what stuck and how they splattered and then make a movie from the messy results. What comes out is incoherent and impossible to understand. "Aeon Flux" is "Plan 9 From Outer Space" with better looking actors and a huge production budget. Well no, it's not even that, say what you will about Ed Wood, he at least liked the movies he made and threw himself into them, but it's doubtful that anyone involved in "Aeon Flux" viewed this incoherent mess as anything other than a paycheck, and it shows. Save your money, in a few years this will be on Showtime late at night as a replacement for "Beastmaster III" and if you're up late you can watch it then 
 As a desginer, I can not understand the meaning of this book.  1.Take any scantling rule of classification societies and compare. Scantlings section of rulebook is much more thin, but provides more optoins and engineering basics for calculations of strength. 2.What is the meaning of Gerr's own scantling rule, if You have to proceed design approval from classification society? You better use the rulebook of this society, aren't You? 3.The book use several assumptions that I mind. For example, the recommendation to add some per cent of hull thickness for every knot over 10 knots is not reasonabe. The designer should deal with speed/length ratio to determine planning/non planning bottom loads. 4.The book does not give any idea of hull loads. Overview of loads is desired as soon as he write about strength, something like provided in L.Larsson R.Eliasson "Principles of Yacht Design".   But I really like other Gerr's books, indeed!  Best regards, A.Nazarov, Naval Architect, Ph.D. 
 These books are a good idea for the repeat visitor to a city-- basically just a place for notes in the lovely (I think) Moleskine format.  The maps, though, can be found better and cheaper on other places.  MORE IMPORTANT,  this seller has claimed a falsely inflated list price and consequent discount that is misleading.  The list price for these books is 17.95.  Check in any book store.  Shame on the seller 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 This book by Altoon Sultan is basically a dumbed-down version of Daniel V. Thompson, Jr.'s excellent introduction to the medium in his book The Practice of Tempera Painting.  While photographs abound, they are most  useful in displaying Sultan's uninspired use of hatching and  cross-hatching.  If your looking at acquiring this book because you are a  Sultan fan, it might be just the thing to help you understand how her  images are made.  If you want a good instructional book on egg tempera,  keep looking 
 John Fowles is a talented writer, and I think that if you end up buying this book, you will not be disappointed. It has some interesting points in  it. Many deep thoughts, some interesting chapters. But, the problem is that  I don't think that the story of "Daniel Martin" is a good one. It  is not fascinating, atleast it didn't raise my interest. At some point I  started to dislike this Daniel Martin.. He seemed boring and dull, just  like any stupid, chauvinistic, self-centered, egoistic middle-aged man you  can see. Maybe there is a point in describing a person like that, but  frankly: I am not very thrilled to read about a man like that, I think I've  met too many "daniel martins" in real life 
 The book seems to miss the mark. It just seems like he thought he could slap star wars and christianity on it to make a quick buck. Hey these 2 things have made tons of money in the past right? Ok not a good idea to put the 2 things together. Get dharma of star wars and leave this book on the dark side 
 I liked the pace, flow ,and language of this novel. My problems stemmed from character behavior, having grown up in Texas I could not relate to these boys. I can not imagine any scenario where a groupsof teenage boys would get together to go have sex witha calf. I'm not naive to think this has never happened, it muight even happen on a regular basis, but not as a group activity with half the high school there to watch. Like ise there is no great homophobic group than teenage boys and for the author to say they made a habit of grabbing for each other's privates came across as unbelievable. Once I can't beleive a books characters, I no longer care about the story.   
 woww oh yea um no talent. not fun to listen to, way to much unneccessary screaming. nothing goes well with anything. this is the only screamo band tht can give me a headache..sorry. the only ok song is TO the Readers. All the other ones are repetitive and just are not goo 
 Lahaye once again showed his weak eschatology and also shows he rehashes the poor "research" done by other bible "teachers".  While I know the pre tribulation rapture is proved in the bible, very few pre-tribulation "teachers" have studied for themselves and do not see what is clearly taught in the bible.  Instead of doing their own research, they rehash and regurgitate the poorly researched articles and books written by extremely poor researchers.  Lahaye is guilty of rehashing poor research taught by other "teachers".  Lahaye is also guilty of changing what the bible clearly teaches and has deceived millions.  One example of his false teaching is that someone can take the mark of the beast and still be saved and go to heaven.  This DOWNRIGHT LIE has deceived people into thinking that 'taking the mark' is 'no big deal'.  All his books show the tribulation is "no big deal" and people can go on living fairly normally while judgements are happening (seems he doesn't think antichrist will turn off cell phones, electricity, or internet if they refuse his mark)  I will restate that the bible clearly teaches a pretribulation rapture - only none of the 'POPULAR' bible "teachers" do their own research so they never publish the clear teachings of a pre tribulation rapture.  Lahaye has done more to deceive the world than most people do - and he will be rewarded severely for his works.  Remember - Jesus said if the world loves someone, they are not His - because the world will hate those that are His as they hate Him.  Popularity of ANY bible "teacher" should be suspect because of what Jesus said.  Lahaye is a false teacher teaching deception that closely mimics the truth (just enough to be believed by most 
 I thought that this bathtub would be the best thing, because of the shower and spa feature. But the shower is so hard to use, it's so hard to push the button and hold the shower head at the same time. You also have to worry about your baby falling off or sliding down off the sling, beacause it's just not positiioned right, it sits too high up, and she just looks uncomfortable on it. You also have to worry about your baby hurting their toes on the shower and spa unit. It wasn't worth $40, the sling, and the spa and shower unit isn't useful or helpfula t all 
 As a first time Baldacci reader, I expected at least an enjoyable read.  What I found was a book so poorly written, I couldn't complete it.  I skipped to the end to discover if the solution would be as predictable as it seemed from the outset.  Bingo!    I could have accepted the unrealistic characters if only the dialogue had been believable.  Sadly, it is unimaginably unskillful.    This is a banal, predictable, formulaic book.  If you are a reader who values words and style, best skip this one 
 beware! i think this book is can not illuminate anything to anyone not trained in jungian psychology and/or who just loves to be plunged into and having to plough through 200p of very unclear pros 
 this is the most pretentious and hollow book I have ever read, and to think it came so highly recommended. If there is such a thing as prog-litterature then this almost certainly is a prime example 
 When I purchased this dvd I was really excited about the chance of finally seeing George and Louis live.But as soon as the music started I knew what I was in for.Being a musician you know when a set is just not happening. Out of tune saxophone, and just weak musicians altogether.George and Louis`s musicianship has definitely deteriorated.I learned to play bass because of hearing Louis.Now I hate to say it but, I can play like Louis better than Louis.Damn,what a shame 
 The Culture Cult is an ascerbic, sarcastic text that is more concerned with browbeating readers with its stringent defence of Western civilization than examining tribal cultures beyond mere stereotypes.  I originally picked up this book because I was interested in the results of the romanticisation of tribal cultures.  The tendency to romanticise tribal cultures as being closer to nature and more at one with nature has a long history especially among colonial settlers (though in their haste to be seen as higher animals, of course there was less romanticization and more condescending observation).  Often, this romanticization does not fit with the events of the past.  But, Sandall is no objective commentator, attempting to see similarities between civilization and tribal culture and temper romanticization of tribalism.  He is batting for civilization, denigrating tribal cultures as wasteful, ignorant, unaware and incapable of connecting with the environment in an ecologically sound way.  For example, his claim that Maori first wiped out the moa, then the seals before turning to cannibalism displays scant regard for New Zealand history in his desperation to prove that tribal cultures annihilated the environment as Western civiliztion has, does and will continue to do (pp. 122.) (Of course, Sandall is actually trying to prove that tribal cultures were worse than civilization)  The one fact in this example that Sandall manages to get right is that the moa were decimated by Maori.  Not so the seals.  European sealers arrived in New Zealand in their hundreds at the beginning of the 1800s  to join in the sealing trade with grave consequences for seal populations.  But, sealing stopped in the 1900s and the seal population is slowly recovering.  Go to Kaikoura and have a gawk, Roger!    The comment "After using up all the large birds and mammals, the polynesians now began to eat each other"(122) is fantastical.  Yes there was cannibalism BETWEEN tribes DURING or AS A RESULT OF warfare.  If Sandall wants to present cannibalism he has a duty to do just a smidge of research rather than merely extrapolate what he would like to believe.  New Zealand was not a nation before the signing of The Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 and a number of Maori tribes lived on the islands as individual tribes.  There were alliances between some tribes and often wars were fought over land and resouces.  Cannibalism occurred between tribes after wars in a ritualistic manner that has been documented in other tribes. Cannibalism did not occur because people were hungry ("predation by other hungry humans" according to Sandall), nor, as Sandall negligently suggests, did they eat their "own".   There are many factual inaccuracies throughout this book.  Sandall depicts tribal cultures as barbaric and less evolved than civilization which I am sure he, and many of his readers, find very soothing but this adds little to modern debates.  This book is a bitter diatribe for people who want to believe in the superiority of Western civilization. Polarising tribal culture and civilization just fuels exaggerated stereotypes and offers no real solutions to how countries with indigenous populations who predated, and were taken advantage of and abused by, colonial settlements (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America....) are to move forward into the future together.    
 The 2nd book in the "War of Souls" continues.  New characters are fleshed out (Gerard, Mina, Medan) and old characters are included (Tasselhoff, Palin, Laurana, Dalamar, Cyan Bloodbane). All this and no intrigue. This book bored me, much the way part 1 did. Mina's knights continue their amazing success in battle and the origin of the Silvanesti shield is revealed. Mina defeating the Solamnics by scaring them with the dead souls was lame in my opinion, and the revelation of who the One God is was so very predictable. Not my favorite by these 2 authors 
 After reading his last few book with "co-authors" I wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the "co-author". I have been a fan of Mr. Patterson since my first Alex Cross novel almost 10 years ago. While I still enjoy the Cross books, I find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. Alex-vs- the vampire cult??? Kyle Craig a serial killer??? Alex joins the FBI??? Give me a break. I can only hope from the description of Cross X the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves 
 The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.    Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.    Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.    And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.    Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".  By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.    This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.  
 For all of you over 40 whose eyes are not like those of an eagle (can eagles even read??), this book will make you look like Sherlock Holmes as you use your magnifying glass to navigate the streets of New York City.  The type is too little to easily read on the small maps of the city sections inside the book. The index in the back of the book only covers streets so unless you know what you are looking for is in what section of the city, this cumbersome.  
 I didn't enjoy the film.  I also didn't enjoy the original play by Shakespeare.  King Lear is one of my least favorite Shakespeare plays.  I don't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done, and to add nothing of value to the original.  You can set it wherever you like, in medieval Japan or on the Moon, what's the difference.  It's King Lear, a downer of a play, there's nothing great about Ran just as there's nothing great about Lear, and it takes up three hours of your time.  A moron named Lear, or Hidetoro, or whatever his name is, relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son.  The youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father.  He is right, of course, and Hidetoro Lear gets treated shabbily.  He's wanted dead or dead.  In this treatment of the annoying plot, he loses his mind.  He has a faithful follower or two.  They overact.  There is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play.  Lear Hidetoro is an absolute jerk.  Am I supposed to care what happens to him?  Why?  Because he used to be a powerful king, and a cruel one?  You may as well cry over Saddam Hussein.  Look at this movie with fresh eyes.  Look at Shakespeare's King Lear with fresh eyes.  This stuff simply is not very entertaining, and is not very good.  The hell with King Lear.  He's an annoyance 
 All though the fairy tales certainly have the teeth marks of Christianity, I should point out that Grimm's fairy tales are undeniably of Heathen, NOT Christian origin. The author and the below reviewer below failed to recognise the fact tht Grimm was a scholar that deeply studied Teutonic Mythology, in fact he wrote a 4 volumn set dedicated to the study of anceint Germanic Heathenism. I HIGHLY doubt that Grimm felt that the fairy tales were of Christain origin. In fact, when little red riding hood was devoured by the wolf and then released by the hunter this is a direct reflection of the anceint germanic legend of Wotan being released from the belly of the Fenris wolf through his son Vidar the Silent. This is purely pagan expression of rebirth. Jack and the Beanstalk is blatently Heathen, and very few, if any Christain expression can be seriously extracted from this tale. Here is a boy named Jack that travels to Elfland via a "bean stalk"(one of the nine worlds of the World Tree), in which he makes a deal with one of the elves and then takes a journey to Giantland(another one of the nine worlds of the World Tree). In this story, Jack slays a giant and brings food back to his familily. While this could be construed as a good "Christian" deed, I should point out that providing for ones familily was of extreme importants to those whom practiced Heathen religion in anceint times. I do, however, feel that Grimms fairy tales are an inner expression of those whom have germanic roots and I feel that anyone whom has pride in their Northern heritedge, whether  Christian or Asatru(Germanic Heathen), should Grimms fairy tales(which is NOT racist if one respects other cultures and ways of thinking) 
 Itz a pretty basic intro into the topic. I was looking for more depth though ,but itz a start and I didnt really see enything else out there on this topic..... 
 Ah, yes--the huge controversy.  For this opera lover--and tenor--my concern is that in our market-driven consumerist society, the sound of Bocelli will become the norm.  Opera company managers will look for singers who sound like Bocelli in order to bring in more customers.  Opera-and classical music in general--is having an extremely hard time in our current culture.  There is extremely little exposure to it in public schools and even fewer programs for teaching possible future musicians.  With that, such a "phenomenon" as Bocelli may be seen as an even greater risk to these institutions and that mass-market appeal will overcome artistic integrity.  About the "spiritual depth" of his singing, I personally don't buy it, but that is, of course, subjective.   If you want to hear spiritual depth from a real classical singer, listen to Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, for whom many of us are still in deep grief following her death in July from breast cancer. And she was not a "star" in the traditional sense--was never on the Tonight Show--but those who had the furtune of hearing her never forgot her 
 I don't really know what to say about this book. It's shocking and sad. It has summaries of horrible pogroms and covert ops gone really bad. I think the presentation just wasn't as good as I expected. The book even seems a little emotional. Granted, the author is talking about issues that are sensitive and morally significant. It just appears frustration gets the best of him sometimes in the book and that makes his "objectivity" suspect 
 No where does Amazon say in their description, that this comes completely disassembled!  I have purchased other exercise equipment and you usually have to put on a handle bar or stabilizer.  So here it sits in it's box like a big paper weight in the middle of my floor.  Amazon is not paying for return shipping and I can not afford to spend half the amount of the purchase to return it.  Buy your big purchases from someone who has a unconditional paid return policy.  This may be a good machine, but I will never find out.    
 I purchased this one because my 22 month old loves the "hot potato" song, and usually all of the wiggles songs are pretty entertaining -  except the stupid high-speed singing puppets.  I thought the dvd player was going nuts but it was just the song.  Would not recommend this dvd 
 Another attempt to cash in on the "I knew Elvis before he weighed 475 lbs" craze. Who really cares? The man was an semi-articulate imbecile who sang the same juvenile songs with inane lyrics his entire life. He never grew culturally, intellectually or musically, although he grew quite a bit physically. Only in America could a hillbilly named "Elvis" become the idol of millions. Grow up, people. The only thing extraordinary about Presley was his pompadour which, I believe, is listed in the Guiness Book of Wolrd Records for highest, silliest hair-style. Everything else was due to Colonel Parker, a shrewed promoter and businessman who put a moronic hick, with marginal talent, into a star. The only brilliant talent in the equation is Parker. Your hero Elvis was a lackey 
 I like my blues to be blue.  I want hard times, heartache.   I'm surprised how often Muddy sings happy songs - one's titled "So Glad I'm Living", another one "I Feel So Good."   And then there are all the sexual braggadocio songs, like "My Love Strikes Like Lightning."   But my favorite songs are the dark ones - songs like "Still a Fool," or "You Shook Me,"  a letter to a fantastic lover who's ruining his marriage and lover - and "Black Night, which, fitting its title, is just all around dark.   Muddy Waters had a great band behind him/with him - I read on Wikipedia that they were known as the Headhunters, because they would go to a club where someone else was playing, ask to sit in, then "cut the heads off" the locals with their musicianship.  You hear a tight band, a group of guys that knows how to play together, on songs like "I Feel So Good" and "Bird Nest on the Ground."   But the musician who really stands out is Little Walter, on the harmonica.  That guy can howl, and make you feel it.  He's especially hot on "Sugar Sweet."  
 This is Rehash of the first edition - same boring material regurgitated back at you. It's like taking ugly red-headed step-child and trying to dye his hair black but the roots and the freckles show through the disguise - still ugly and red-headed - like this book. This author can't take any critisism - don't worry - he'll cry like a little baby to amazon offical and this will get taken down. I try to warn you that this book won't be loved to dog ears - it sit on shelf and become dust bunny catcher because the circuits are wrongness and the most don't go well 
 This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste. 
 Mr. Miller of Canada has said it well and thoroughly.  Apparently, according to Granger, he never met a beautiful woman that he did not fall in love.  On the other hand, the three men in his life appear to have been accidents, from the naval officer in Hawaii who seduced him after Granger noted he had already had sex twice with a prostitute.  he encountered Arthur Laurents and only ended up living with him for the lack of other accommodations.  And the man we assume he has been with for how many years (?) was like an afterthought and if the reader is not careful you might miss him entirely although he is listed as a co-author.  At least Granger was a star in his own eyes. 
 My son grew out of it very quickly, and frankly he didn't care about it at all.   I would think this is for 6-9month old babies.    
   The questions in the theoretical exams do not reflect what you will find on the actual test. If you use this book alone to prepare, there is a good chance you will fail the exam. In general, the questions will help you to grasp some fundamentals, but you will need to go over some more realistic test questions to prepare 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 Read Corso's The Day After Roswell and also Jim Marrs Alien Agenda after this one.  This reads like disinformation from the 50's. For those who wish it to all go away and to not have to think any longer, this is your book folks.   Just another voice who asks you not to look behind the curtain is all.  Writing style was not all that great either 
 Everyone talks about it, but noone wants to read it. The book has about 5 pages of good advice. Unfortunately, it is distributed across 450 pages of bloated reminiscenses by windbags who bored even their contemporaries to death with endless tales of their salad days in court. Sad. It's about as useful in modern litigation as a copy of Hammurabi's code, but not nearly as succinct.   Do yourself a favor and get a copy of Nolo's Deposition Handbook, which has about 300 pages of good advice conveniently distributed over 300 pages of text. 
 The game has weak content and strategy.  We played it twice but neither of us experienced any excitement.  The game is now shelved and I don't foresee it ever being played again.  Disappointed but somehow not surprised. 
 I was enjoying the travel parts of the book, despite numerous detours of self-serving/indulgent behavior by Mr. Crichton,until I reached the part where he was in Bangkok. He teams up with a journalist for a night on the town. His journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area's many brothels. Finally,  after testing the waters, the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and  suggests a child whorehouse. Crichton doesn't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him. Instead,he goes and checks the place out. He gives a description of tarted up six-year-old girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes. Perhaps I'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile. I didn't expect Crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex wasn't his thing, instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him. This infuriated me and turned my stomach. I threw the book in the trash. I wish publishers had done the same. FYI, there is no zero star option 
 I quit reading this book after 225 pages. Like most of the books I give 2 stars, I'm going to leave that one statement as a major testament to what this book did for me. I don't know if it's fair or not. I'm sure scores of Bloom fans will say I'm too ignorant to understand it. Maybe I am. But the purpose of writing a review is to be consistent in rating the books I read. I find the lack of lower ratings on many books puzzling. If you read a book and it isn't to your liking, you should say so. For me, this was of very little interest, and just wasn't a very good book.  I found the commentary about Adam and Eve to be the most interesting part of the book. Everything else, including the Book of J itself, was hard to take. The introductory piece before the translation was downright painful, and the only thing that got me through it was the notion that the actual book couldn't be much worse. I was right, that it couldn't be much worse. But it wasn't really any better either. For me, these stories are too transitory and scattered to be of much interest.  The commentary starts off well, but then sinks into an almost desperate attempt to declare that J is a) a woman, b) the main influence of Shakespeare, and c) the main influence of many classic Western voices (Tolstoy/Freud/Kafka/etc). After 225 pages, I got so sick of hearing this assertion that I quit the book and stared out the train window for the next 45 minutes. The total lack of focus and drove me bonkers.  I think scholars of the subject might enjoy the book, but casual fans of literary works will have a tough time with it. As a reference, I have read Michener's Source, and recently Rushdie's Satanic Verses. Both are steeped in religion, and both held my interest for many pages, the latter more than either. But this book, well, it was very difficult for me to keep at. Those who don't already have a working knowledge of the subject matter are going to struggle with this.  It's not necessarily that I think this book is lousy. It's just impossible for me to really identify with. And in that sphere of existence, the one I live in, it's a 2 star book, simply because I would rather watch the buildings, cars, and grass go by the train window than read it any further. Take it for what it's worth, but that was my experience.  Not for the casual reader 
 In school you are sometimes asked to summarize extremely lengthy books into one or two sentences to evaluate your knowledge on that certain piece of literature.  To me, that always seemed ridiculous because how could you accurately depict the true value of a 300-page book within two measly paragraphs?  That feeling is exactly my reaction to Ridley Scott's overly produced and underly executed film, Legend.  Throughout the film I felt that Scott had the potential to go anywhere and everywhere, really making this underground cult fantasy film bigger than The Neverending Story and Lord of the Rings put together.  I felt this way because 80s fantasy films seemed to be less commercial and more imaginative than those released in the past decade.  I was waiting for a stronger outing of Willow, but instead I saw Legend disintegrate right before my eyes.  It was as if Ridley had 300-plus pages of material, but had to condense it all into two very small paragraphs.  What ultimately happened was that we, the viewer, were cheated out of quite a bit of potential visuals, creative lands, and mythical creatures.  We were instead handed a body of work that seemed to grasp at straws instead of development, weak heroic characters with an exaggeration on Curry's over-the-top "Price of Darkness" portrayal, and a finale that teetered on sarcasm instead of excitement.    Legend, in my eyes, begins with an unsettling "bang".  We see no characters outside of a menacing voice that speaks in rhyme and talks about the end of light.  Scott pulls us gracefully in by giving us these highly imaginative characters and a world that we think will be full of Hensen-esque creatures.  Alas, immediately after pulling at our dark sides, he slaps us in the face with what seems like an hour of pointless drivel with conversation between the Princess Lilly and her man-boy Jack (played by Mia Sara and Tom Cruise respectively).  Caught between horrid writing, unfamiliar past experiences, and a uni-brow the size of Kansas on Cruise's face, we are left with nothing to do except wait.  With the promise of unicorns and a possible dark future, we wait.  The unicorns finally appear and darkness does become momentarily triumphant, but what never brings us back to that immediate opening of dark delight is that Scott never recreates it for us.  Legend fails, not just because of the shallow acting, but because the story never quite hits the momentum it had at the beginning of the film.  While this critic blames Ridley's choice of Sara and Cruise as our guides, I do think he could have strengthened the story to be a bit more energetic and sweeping.  I felt trapped throughout this story, as if the walls that contained Princess Lilly were the actual boundaries of the film.  This hurt Legend.  Unlike other fantasy films of this nature, the walls of a structure may encase our hero, but we know there are bigger and more exotic things happening around the fictional planet.  With Legend, I never felt that.  I felt as if Scott kept us on a lighted path without the comfort or luxury of any outside imagination.  I needed, maybe even wanted, to see more of this planet Scott created, but the door was shut abruptly in my face.  I would like to state again that I thought Scott had good intentions with this film, but the final result (either from its original bad screenings to the infamous "director's cut") just didn't feel like it was worth the two hours one had to put into the movie.  Scott had some (I stress "some") moment of excitement, moments of imagination, and moments of sheer fantasy, but they were all clouded by the brazen push of over-the-top melodrama and visions.  What makes most fantasy films work is that you care both for the story as well as the characters.  In Legend, the story seems weak because we care nothing for the characters.  Cruise's portrayal of Jack could have been done by anyone who passed Acting 101, while Curry does give the BEST performance of the film, it is another case of "anyone-itis".  Without the horns or the bold eyes, anyone could have been underneath the mask.  Curry did great, but take him out of the costume and ask the question, does he stand-alone?  Follow this up with some elves and dwarves that seemed more clichï¿½ than original, and the final result is an ill-fated Legend.  I wanted to like this film.  I knew about the cult-ish status of Scott's fantasy attempt, but in the end, I felt bored instead of moved by the overall picture.   Overall, I cannot recommend a second viewing to this film.  I went in expecting a larger-than-life Willow or Neverending Story (or at least enough darkness to counter Alien or Blade Runner), but instead finished the film thinking that in today's standards this would have counted as a "direct to video" release.  Scott, as well as his brother, are fabulous directors and continue to push the boundaries on modern cinema, but Legend failed.  Legend failed because of the story as well as the acting.  Both were not in place, therefore, both could not work together.  During the commentary, Scott mentions his passion for Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, but it was obvious that he was just name-dropping to gain film critic's respect.  Legend, if anything, insults Cocteau's masterpiece.  From the wrongly used word of the title (not a legend but a fairy-tale), to Cruise's uni-brow, to the cheaply forgettable ending, Legend didn't impress and it would be very difficult to sit through another viewing without some cash in hand.             Grade: ** out of **** 
 never got this boo 
 this book was very informative...but I don't feel that it gave me what I  was looking for.  I was hoping to get more on how to turn jealousy around.   On a positive note, it does give different situations and the aspect of the  nonjealous partner - so in that respect, it was an eye opener.  But I felt  it didn't give enough information on how to cope and rise above jealousy 
 This wasn't a "book".  It was a few flimsy pages of very thin poor quality paper, tied together with a plastic ring.  It did nothing to help identify water fowl in flight.  Anyone can identify a duck once it is in hand.  This pamplet was a big disappointment.  A fair price for it would have been about $1 dollar, not $10 
 I had to read this book for a class in Legal Ethics given by Professor Dershowitz (Dersh) at Harvard Law School. I threw it in the trash when I was done, and for good reason. The topic is interesting, but tired. How do you defend a guilty man? You don't. Unfortunately, Dersh (and, to be fair, many others also) does. The focus of the book is on the ostensibly proper division of a defense attorney between two personas: that of a person and that of an attorney. Dersh feels that a defense attorney leaves behind his personal ethical standards and morals when he takes a case and goes to the edge of the envelope in legal ethics to successfully defend his client. I don't think such a person has a personal morality. If it can be subjected to a second persona, it isn't morality. The worst part of the book is its writing. It is poorly written, poorly developed, and has a completely unbelievable "happy" ending. Dersh had to cater to his feminist viewpoints in the ending and that's unfortunate because it denies his central character (himself) the pain of truly feeling the results of his own amorality 
 This is a complete repackaging of "A Writer's Book of Days" and the blurbs on the package do NOT warn you. There is no new material at all. If you already have the book, then you have everything the "kit" has to offer 
 Every singer has his song, on this album Robbie nails Beyond The Sea and the rest of the songs suck.  Louis Armstrong nailed Mack the Knife and Frank Sinatra nailed It Was A Very Good Year.  Robbie William does not have the depth these singers have to pull off these songs.  Sorry.  Hope you did not purchase this album.  You can get the Finding Nemo soundtrack for half the price and it has Beyond the Sea on it 
 This is an interesting book, in that it might encourage the reader to think about things outside of the one's traditional framework.  However, if you take the time to dig up the articles that Radin uses as "proof", you will find that some of them are all but incoherent.  I tracked down the authoring scientist behind some of the papers regarding time, and he informed me that his results were due to chance and not replicable (and also that he is no longer a scientist).  It makes me wonder if Radin actually read the articles before disseminating incorrect information to the public.  I realize that scientists have to eat too, but Radin should never have sold a book at the expense of truth.  Also, be careful with the graphs, which are often organized in a deceptive way.  I can verify that some of the psychokinesis stuff is legit, but I would advise anyone who reads this book to a) take it as fiction, b) find the original articles, and c) try to replicate the experiments yourself.  It sets us all back to have people spreading false information.  Peace 
 The concept was a dream for monster fans -- combine Werewolves, Frankenstein (Shuler Hensley), Jeckel/Hyde, and Dracula, with Bram Stoker's vampire-chaser Van Helsing, adapting Van Helsing into a young man, with Hugh Jackman to play him.  Then feature lots and lots and lots of Dracula's Brides screaming through the air against green-screen.  And miss out on many possible expositional scenes.  One of the few movies I've wondered when it would mercifully end, and I'm a Hugh Jackman fan.  My son and I kept saying,  "But why didn't they . . .?" -- show, not tell, and my daughter-in-law shrugging,  "It was what it was."  What it was was a mess.  When the TV "Making Of" feature was more exciting than the film, Houston, we have a problem.  Read the book instead 
 This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. They offer 30 day trial on this product, I wasn't happy and mailed it back to them in 5 days of purchase and I'm still waiting for the refund. I have called them 3 times, it has been almost 4 months now without a refund. I would never buy a Nova product from this company again and I would recomend everyone going somewhere else to get good customer service 
 These cuts sound like re-recordings of 78's. I love Bix. There is no one better. To think that his recordings sounded so good with the limited technology of the time. I have Columbia 33 rpm Bix LP's from the 60's that have more clarity and less noise than these CD's. Even though I've allmost worn them out they still sound much much better than these offerings.I bought these CD's for 20 bucks at Tower records and I will never listen to them again.I give a Trillion-Billion stars to Bix's playing but this reissue's quality deserves none.But ...hey! Bix Lives!!!! 
 I found this book very depressing. Anne Lamott's constant self-deprecation throughout the book caused me to really doubt myself as well. I know she is doing it to show that she's human just like the rest of us, but I think she can show that without hating on herself every chance she gets (saying the 9-year-old version of herself looked like a neurotic cat woman, etc.) despite what she says about how you shouldn't do that. It's like hanging around with a bunch of anorexic models, it gets to you.  This is not a good book for people who are not sure they are writers. I am not a writer but I am interested in writing and I would very much like to write fiction but I have a lot of trouble writing authentically. Lamott sends the message that "As long as you're a writer, as long as you're in our secret little club, everything will be okay!" 
 I was looking at authors in the long-term-women-friendships genre.   I came across this author; read the excerpt and made the caustic mistake of wasting $13.00 on it.  On and on it drones... it never goes anywhere exciting, shocking, interesting, etc.   The characters are unbelievably boring; none of them have enough meat on their bones to sustain my interest for very long.   I made it 1/2 way through before eventually using it to line the bird cage!    ZZZZzzzz...... 
 Evidently a lot of people love this man's writing, but they must be loving something else because this book is about worthless. Forgetting the issue of PC-ness he broaches by having an Arab-American as the terrorist of the title, it's just not very likely. Other reviewers have said that he chose this character as his instrument to reflect on the state of America today, and his origin serves solely as a plot device to cause his disaffection with this society. But I think if that's the case, it's a weak and unnecessary device, given that there are plenty of Americans who are as disaffected and more prone to violence than some half-Arab New Jersey teenager. As a matter of fact, although it's a topic not often discussed, the main terrorist threat in America comes from white Christian extremists. These people aren't even theoretical; they've actually been responsible for real terrorist acts all over the United States.  Be that as it may, Updike is one of the least astute character writers I've ever read. If anyone reading this doesn't like that assessment, I suggest picking up Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment" or "The Brothers Karamazov". Now that's some character writing. I just felt like he endlessly described people's outsides and never touched their insides. It's a book, which means that you have the ability to show the reader the thoughts and feelings of a person, but not to adequately depict their facial expressions or colorations (in other words, it's not a picture). And yet he rarely took the opportunity to get inside anyone's mind, even the main character Ahmad's. And what little internal narration he did give Ahmad was pretty much the same thing over and over again. As for the other characters, he may have intended them to be mockeries of real people instead of making them real people, but if he was doing that I certainly didn't pick up any hints of satire to clue me in. The whole book was dead serious, and dead boring.  I tend to lump all books into two main categories: they're either about the characters or the plot. Given that the characters were such a failing in this book, you might be tempted to think the plot redeems it in some way. You would be wrong. The story itself advances slowly with about three-fourths of the book being wasted in unnecessary build-up (which would be fine if there were decent characters, but as it is...). The climax is so anti-climactic it actually made me sleepy. There's absolutely no payoff in the end.  If you're a fan of this guy, perhaps this book could work for you. For me, it was an unfortunate reading choice and a complete waste of time. If you want to read books about domestic terrorists that are just as implausible but a lot more exciting, pick up Tom Clancy 
 I read this book and it confirmed my feelings that USA, as the only super power, should ALWAYS remain STRONG.   The book is composed of some 400 pages full of critiques as if the author wanted America to be the haven of saints when the world has been full of crocodiles, for instance the introduction brings about a fair resume of the author's intentions  How!   In the Introduction I came across a passage which I hereby quote `''It was in the early days of the Vietnam War that a Vietcong officer said to his American prisoner _' You were our heroes after the war, and a common phrase in those days was `'to be as rich and as wise as an American'' - What happened `''.   The title `Killing Hope' - updated edition 2004 - by William Blum, and many of the contents are indeed offensive to the USA because it speaks about U.S military and C.I.A 'interventions' since World War II and endeavours to portray them as the bad guys.  C.I.A (USA) intervensions?   Didn't such 'intervension' save many countries that now live under the 'shades' of democracies, in Europe and the Far East (Japan) enjoying unprecedented richness and prosperity, with a high standard of living for their nationals.  As one individual out of six billion living on this planet, do I blame the USA for protecting the interest of its citizens.  USA is The World Giant and one has to learn how to convince them of one's view points , rather than garrulously defy them with boring speeches and  empty written words. 
 Not appreciably less racist than the 1941 diatribe "Germany Must Perish!" by Theodore N Kaufman which advocated sterilizing the entire German population.  As an aside, I doubt whether that little masterpiece (pubished before holocaust started) was helpful to the Jews in German-occupied territory.  What the Nazis did which is actually proveable is bad enough without resorting to fabrications, distortions, and racist, anti-teutonic rhetoric.  However one does wonder why it is treated as heresy to question the extent of Nazi war crimes against the Jews while no other episodes of state-sponsored mass murder (Lenin/Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot) get the same treatment.  Food for thought 
 I thought her book was insensitive and terrible, especially the chapter she dedicates to "playing poor" with her husband (trying to make it through the weekend without going to Starbucks too often).  And then she has the nerve to complain when her husband (who earns the family income) uses her $100+ bottle of shampoo.  Please!  She should be sent to the third world, where she can learn about how much REAL women struggle to feed their families and survive a world that does not respect them.  This book is not about marriage and unconditional love for another - it's about selfish, ridiculous behavior that only spoiled first worlders could imagine.  
 The Vista set up is nice but is buggy and incompatible with a lot of games and upgrades 
 It is said that people who live in the past are people who have no future. Perhaps so many musicians wanting to live in the past was a sign of the times. Jimmy Carter definitely sent a message to the people that America's best days are over and I guess many musicians thought that their best days were over too.   I don't know if this was the case with John Lennon since he was able to produce "Double Fantasy" five years later which was an excellent album. Still, living in the past is simply not living. It is just existing.  In addition, there are no tracks written by John Lennon on this album which is a terrible disappointment. Lennon went from "Wall and Bridges" which was one of the most heartfelt albums he ever did to a record in which he did not even write his own music.  Some of the tracks are good and even some of the lyrics are a bit different but the original artists did a far better job of writing and singing them.   Let's say if Fats Domino were to try to sing "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" from the Beatles, it may sound good but the Beatles can do it better. Or let's say Little Richard was to sing "Imagine" originally done by Lennon, surely Lennon could sing that song better. Musicians do best when they stay in their own backyard.  If Lennon wanted to live in the 50s so badly, the best thing for him to do was to write original songs with a 50s style beat. That would have taken care of the nostalgia part. Doing an album of noting but cover songs in order to reminisce...."and pocketing the profits" along with it.. is a sign of an artist who's career is going down the sewer pipe.  If you want Buddy Holly, buy a Buddy Holly record. If you want Fats Domino, buy Fats Domino. If you want John Lennon, buy "Walls and Bridges", "Double Fantasy", "Imagine" or one of the other classics that Lennon himself wrote.   . . . .If you want to waste your hard earned money, buy this album.  
 ...when you're gearing up for suicide. This whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who's going to just end it all. I found myself suffering nightmares, fatigue, misery and paranoia. My ears unclogged but I started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head. This is not a good album for the stressed, because it will just make you feel worse. I find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable. When I first listened to it it sounded inaccessable, after listening to it more and more I started to get more "into" it, but I can't say I found it a good place to be in. It's a somewhat interesting album, but it mostly just dragged me down, made me nervous, numb and hurt my head.   People say this is great music. Let them say what they want. Give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that doesn't make a pest of itself. Kid A is just ok to me, and hasn't been worth all the effort to "get into". This almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners. I don't know, maybe I'm missing something, but to hear some "weird" music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears, try "Passengers" by U2.  And Thom York sings like a Muppet on this album.  By the way I've enjoyed Radiohead's first three albums quite a bit (including Pablo Honey -- why are people always busting its chops). 
 Why would a publisher ever agree to publish a book 40 years after other authors have published the same material? This book, 40 years after other writers on the subject, contains no new information, adds nothing to the history of historical events, and discloses nothing that hasn't already been known or already described in the same detail in other books! Save your time and read something else 
 Not recommended.  This allegedly "contrarian" book argues that the hot trends of the last 6 years (outperformance by small and value stocks) will continue for the next 20.  I find any argument for the continuation of well-established trends inherently suspicious, but purchased this anyway to challenge my notion (based on other sources, mostly Morningstar) that large growth is attractively valued right now (even if French & Fama are right about small & value being best in the long run).  I didn't find much to challenge my view.  The author's argument seems to be based entirely on reversion to mean, without any consideration of current valuations (P/E, Price/Book, Price/Sales) of the different market segments.  Two aspects raise the specter of data mining.  First, the reversion analysis is based entirely on 20-year rolling data, but the grounds for picking 20 are thin.  He says it's a typical holding period, but so are 10 and 25; I see no curiosity displayed whether the results would hold if different periods were used.  Second, the stock picking rules laid out in Chapter 8, singled out for praise by another reviewer, give the appearance of having been selected from thousands of possible rules.  I can't tell if these were previously published and have worked since then, but the backtesting is ALWAYS spectacular, and if enough rules were tried then the success of these was just random chance.  The author's portfolio recommendations are all domestic equity, and compared to a strawman historically bad allocation.  Bonds are ultimately dismissed, although the chapter devoted to them contains some good information.  REIT's, international investing, and commodities are skipped over in favor of advice to hire an advisor (which the author happens to be).  The chapter on asset allocation should thus be called "My domestic stock picks," and contains no analysis of the benefits of rebalancing volatile asset classes.  It's almost surely a mistake to own more than ~80% stocks, but you'd never know that from reading this book.    Another problem is the author's simultaneous praise at pp. 181 and 183-84 for the respective selection criteria of the Vanguard Value and Growth ETF's.  The MSCI indexes (on which these funds are based) are just the flip sides of a coin.  Of the 750 largest U.S. stocks, each index (and fund) contains only and exactly what the other does not.  Thus if one is good, the other is bad.  Ownership in both makes a simple cap-weighted index of the top 750 stocks (similar to  S&P 500 funds, which the author elsewhere condemns).  In fairness, there is some good information on the tech boom and bust, demographics, and 401(k)'s.  My bottom line, though, is that I got more out of both Richard Ferri's book on Asset Allocation, and William Bernstein's Four Pillars of Investing, even though it's out of date.    One final nit: IBM did not create the first laptop computer, in 1986, as stated on p. 242.  That was Data General, in 1984.  
 This is my first Woods book, and as a fan of this genre I was very disappointed.  The love story between Cary and Stone in this novel is one of the most unrealistic, ridiculous ones I have ever read.  Right before the rather dull and predictable climax, Stone dreams of marrying this woman and having kids with her.  WHY????  Other than her apparent physical attributes and sexual prowess she offers nothing of substance.  By the end of the novel, even before the incredibly predictable revelation of who pushed Sasha, she was an immensely unlikable person.  Yet we are to believe that our handsome, intelligent protagonist is in love with this woman.  COME ON!!!    The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because there were one or two plot twists early on that I found interesting.  Even though I have a couple of Woods paperbacks on my shelf, I am not sure I will read him again.  If so, I hope the next one is better than this mess 
 Q (Larry Cohen, 1982)  I have very fond memories of seeing this as a teen, and rented it for the purpose of giving it another look though older eyes. Unfortunately, to say Q hasn't aged well is being quite kind.  Quetzalcoatl, the title character, is a very large bird/serpent who's flying around New York eating people who find themselves in high places. At least, he might be Quetzalcoatl (an Aztec god). Or he might just be a big mutant. No one knows. More to the point, no one seems to be overly surprised that there is a large flying serpent picking off New Yorkers. The cops assigned to the case, Shepard (David Carradine) and Powell (Richard Roundtree), certainly take things in stride. The Commissioner (Malachy McCourt, Frank's brother) is the only one who expresses any sort of normal reaction to the events-- disbelief.  While the big bird and the cops are the meat of the story, its actual core is Jimmy Quinn (a young Michael Moriarty), a small-time crook who's run afoul of some tough characters through no real fault of his own. Jimmy's odd relationship with the monster could have turned this into a wonderful psychological thriller, and there are glimmers of that sort of thing, but the script never follows through. Q has more the feel of a quickie monster flick-- none of the storylines is explored much beyond the surface, the special effects are alarmingly (and hysterically) low-budget, and the characters, were they to stand still, could often substitute for props.   But, hey, it's got a big flying lizard. That's something. * 
 I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it. I gave it an honest try, but I found this book unreadable. Maybe it's the translation from the original Greek text, but the sentence structure was very hard to follow. That being said, I found Zorba to be the type of person I would actively avoid spending any time with. Longwinded, drunken, sexist, and generally unpleasant. The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful 
 As usual, Fodor has a lot to write on philosophy of mind, but not much to say. This book should be entitled "My theories have no content- but please read my essays." Very weak 
 Ah, Pierre, you lusty Frenchman, where do you go wrong? Actually the main character Pierre is an American in the early 19th century who is well-off leading an easy life, until suddenly a mysterious woman crosses his path, who happens to be his sister, that he has rather strong feelings for, not to mention the creepy way he calls his mother sister in the early part of the book. Overly dramatic, it reads as if Melville made it up as he wrote, since so many crucial facts and events are suddenly mentioned with no foreshadowing or even hint of them. It does have a brief amusing chapter that attacks critics as people who praise medicore writers that risk nothing. Melville desperately wants Pierre to be like Shakespeare's Hamlet, butt alas, Pierre is much too flat and shallow for that. Aside from Melville Scholars, this novel isn't worth serious reading and skimming a few chapters would demonstrate it's many problems. Go for "Moby-Dick" or "Bartleby the Scrivner" for a real sense of Melville's writing 
 After "Lazarus Long" I had high expectations for this audio book.  It seems, however, that Heinlein "lost it" between 1946 and 1961!  The book starts out interestingly enough but once VMS goes out on his own, it becomes a joke!  Heinlein's endless anti-religion, diatribes, voiced through the mouths of VMS and the insufferable "Jubal Hershaw" made me want to chew my leg off, just to get away!  (Apologies to "Hitchiker's Guide!")  I stuck it out though, hoping for a "second wind," but there was no wind, just a SUCKING sound! Jubal is basically Marvin the Robot on downers! Any real person with his outlook would've eaten a gun LONG ago.  VMS is an "Ubermench" strung out on Qualludes!  "I grock this...I grock that...I grock grocking..." Blah Blah Blah.  I didn't grock this book at all! The final scene wherein VMS allows himself to be vivisected reminded me of the "Black Knight" scene from Monty Python's "Holy Grail"..."It's only a flesh wound!" Oh, and lastly, what's with Foster and Digby and VMS himself in some sort of weird afterlife "adjusting their halos!?"  Methinks Heinlein may have discovered Acid in his later life. Bottom line, a waste of 16 hours of my time...thank God (yes, THAT God!) I didn't have to pay for it

 I Have read two books by Rob Thomas, "Rats Saw God" and "Slave Day".  Because I Read the former of the two books, "Rats Saw God" first, I assumed that Thomas was a fairly good novelist.  NOT SO!!  Slave Day follows the lives of several different high school students and one high school teacher over the course of one day.  The book piles too many subplots into too little a writting space.  In one plot, a supposed "rebel" deals with an evil teacher.  In another, a nerd does all he can to impress the "hottie" of the school.  The book's content was very depressing, and the ending was FAR TO ABRUPT.  When rating this item, I seriously considered giving it a "3" because it does have its good points.  Unfortunatley, the good points do not outshine its bad points 
 First off anybody who knows anythying about poker will tell you chris moneyfaker is a lucky FLUKE in the world of poker. If you actually watched the 2003 WSOP which i did you will see the definition of RIVERRAT is chris moneyfaker.  He caught every lucky card on the turn and the river and should have been elimanated early like the scrub he is.  Even the announcers in 2005 refer to him a a fluke. I did not read this book because i have been playing NL HOLD'EM for many years and can say for a fact that i'm a better player then the lucky loser and i real books like SKLANSKY'S THE THEORY OF POKER OR BRUNSON'S SUPER SYSTEM these are books written by the real deals not some SCRUB AS* LOSER who catches lucky cards.  I will end this review by saying anyone who actually thinks chris moneyfaker is a real poker player knows nothing about poker and trust me ten years from now see how many WSOP BRACELETS this fake lucky loser has.  Guarantee it wont be 9 or 10 like doyle brunson,phill helmuth or johhny chan have who actually know how to play the game.  The only reason this book was written is to profit of IDIOTS who Don't know how to play poker and hope to win the WSOP one day by PURE LUCK AND finally move out of there trailer 
 There is nothing sweet,charming, endearing or amusing about this book. Illustrations are nice and large. It's just dry and boring. Yes it is written for tiny ones and one cannot expect too much in such a short book written for a baby. Completely lacking in imagination, in my opinion, this book is blah. There is so much better out there. Don't waste your money 
 Waiting six years to do a sequel to the more engrossing original, this followup doesn't really seem necessary.  Confusing plot developments, standard effects and mediocre acting combine for a rather tedious thriller.  Christian Slater is going to become the next Stephen Baldwin with his laconic, devil may care and lifeless acting.  Peter Facinelli and Laura Regan try a little harder, but they're swamped in the script's ineptitude.  Maybe it'll be nice to say we haven't seen Christian Slater for a while 
 Although I am sure Cragg has some very interesting things to say, he doesn't know how to say them.  I have read my share of cerebral and professorial books, but Cragg's style leaves *much* to be desired.  His roundabout and cryptic style of writing make for an extremely difficult read.   If you can persist through the maze of words, there is substance here, but it is a daunting read 
 Two huge problems with this book. One, this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and "traveling and learning" when they already know his identity, so I guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass. Two, the city of Los Angeles functions as a character in Kellerman's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels. This thing drags on in some unnamed, nondescript city 
 Read the review by Matthew S.; I agree completely.  I am amazed by all the 5 star reviews, so I must be missing something (like drugs).  I got all the way through the book and took myself out for dinner as a treat for accomplishing the task.  I give this book 1 star as there is no selection for 0 or, better yet, -1.   I found the characters to be out from left field and behaving and thinking in ways far beyond their years.  The book was not believable and was boring 
 Other than it being directed at the younger audience, my only other problem with this book is that the author blatantly badmouths Satanists, I guess religious tolerance doesn't count with that path, and needs to freshen up his knowledge on herbs.  The last time I checked, garlic was not poisonous.  I would not recommend this book to any beginner on the Pagan path without supervision from a more experienced and knowledgeable Pagan.  Overall, there is  some decent information, however, it's got some hiccups along the way 
 I was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character. This is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book, and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it, said parent would have no clue as it sure isn't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book.  I usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this particular book slipped under my radar.  She told me that it had a reference to a gay character, which I took to mean just a passing reference, but when I read the book, it was treated more seriously than I thought, even going so far as to have the two girls kiss.  It is inexcusable, both on Ms Pierce's part and on Scholastic's.  No matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents. I believe that as a parent, I'm the one responsible for what my children see and do, but it sure helps to have some type of information so I can make an informed decision.  Anise Hollingshea 
 This is a novel in superlative style: 'heroic, magnanimous, exalted, brightly, caressingly, exquisite, fascinating, wonderful, sublime, radiant, delightful ...' It confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished Europeans with members of a wealthy Boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love. There is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the social/mental difference between Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century. This book doesn't 'say nothing' (Thomas Hardy, quoted in the introduction), but nearly nothing. It hardly surpasses the level of a three-penny stationary novel, compared with the works of a Dostoevsky or a Flaubert. It is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily.  Only for Henry James fans 
 I had to purchase this book for an economics course. It does have some good examples and applications, but other times the book just bogs down and is impossible to read. Lastly, the price tag is ridiculious... Teachers, don't make your students waste their money on this 
 I loved Girl's Guide and have to agree with most of the reviewers below.  I was so looking forward to another fun, interesting read and for once could not actually finish a book, unusual for me as I will stick with anything unless it's terrible.  This book is just so boring, no spunk or humor; it just fell flat.  I am also finding the Jewish thing to be getting a bit old and overdone in novels these days...aren't there any other ethnic groups to be written about 
 I, also, must second Mark Twain. This book is a waste of time! Why do teachers make us read it when we should be reading Tolkien, GK Chesterton, CS Lewis, and the like? Agh. Then, that could just be my wacky taste in novels...   But this was bad. Oh my gosh!!! The descriptions were ALWAYS needlessly long, the conversations ALWAYS needlessly long, the... blah, blah, blah, blah. That's what the whole thing was. Blah. The whole plot could have been totally condensed to a hecka short 200 pg novel and it would have been a million times better! Maybe even good! And I like long books!   This book is terrible. Listen to the warning of a fellow voracious reader and do not waste your time! 
 When purchasing audiobooks, I normally follow a simple but very effective rule: never, never, never buy an audiobook read by the author. Even if the author is a talented writer, he/she is invariably a terrible narrator. Always look for audiobooks performed by experienced readers, as in Bryson's own "Notes From a Small Island" and "A Walk in the Woods", read by Ron Mclarty.  In Bryson's case I made a rare exception when I listened to "In a Sunburned Country" - the audio version had received reasonable reviews and his performance was indeed adequately entertaining. For this reason I assumed that "Neither Here Nor There" would be equally enjoyable. I was wrong. Bryson's deadpan monologue makes it sound as though he was bored out of his mind while reading this book. Passages that may have seemed amusing in the written version are herein delivered in a sleep-inducing monotone. The sardonically comedic talent he displayed in his reading of "In a Sunburned Country" is totally lacking. I would recommend this audiobook only as a cure for insomnia 
 "Tertium Organum", by P.D. Ouspensky (Uspenskii), a Russian mathematician-turned-mystic who studied under another Russian mystic, G.I. Gurdjieff, is characterized by its regression into Platonism with an Eastern philosophy/psychology undertone.  His conception of consciousness, "cosmic consciousness", as well as his interpretation of Einstein's Theory of Relativity and fourth dimension, is highly mystical and thus has little to do with reality qua reality.  The following is a comparison chart that demonstrates the difference between Aristotle's Organum and Ouspensky's Tertium Organum:              Organum:     A is A.                          A is not not-A.                          Each existent is either A or not-A.      Tertium Organum:     A is both A and not-A.                                 or                          All is A and A is all.  If A is both A and not-A, how can one identify A in the first place?  If Tertium Organum is true, then everything loses its identity and nothing can be known -- even Tertium Organum itself cannot be known.  Ouspensky recognizes that his logic is absurd and attempts to exculpate himself from this apparent contradiction by saying, "We must be prepared for the fact that it is impossible to express superlogical relations ("higher logic") in our language."   Ouspensky's philosophy is based upon a profound mistrust and contempt for man's "ordinary" cognitive process and the power of reason.  His philosophy leads to a complete denial of conceptual knowledge and his "higher logic" is a total negation of reality in the name of a "higher reality".  Only those individuals profoundly dissatisfied and unhappy with reality could aspire to such a philosophy.  Although, P.D. Ouspensky was one of the most brilliant Platonists in history, integrating Eastern mysticism into Platonism with remarkable intellectual sophistication, this brand of mysticism like any other is a symtom of man's default in epistemological integrity and the cause of all human suffering 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 Poor John Searle. He'll cling to freewill mysticism no matter how much empirical evidence renders the concept nonsensical. He goes to great lengths to describe the evolutionary and biophysical aspects of brain functions but then throws it all out the window by invoking some vague notion of emergence as if it can somehow displace large-scale neuronal activity. So how does an interconnected system of neurons generate freewill and hence destiny-controllability? Searle has no answer. He basically just says it pops out of nowhere. Neurons require activation, at what point do they start magically activating themselves spontaneously to generate freewill? The answer is they do not and the sum body of neurological research bears this out. Herein lies the critical issue. Without freewill humans become nothing more than highest-order primates and the concept of "ethics" and "moral choice" are totally negated. "Choices" now become complex neurocognitive reactions. Human beings become no more responsible for their behavior than any other biological organism. The moral concept of "individual responsibility" is displaced by the causality of complex genetic and environmental variables which determine the patterns of human social behavior. Freewill advocates like Searle are deeply afraid of these implications. Searle is disturbed by the notion that he can no longer hold others morally accountable for their unwanted behaviors. Conservative economists can no longer blame the poor for being poor because they aren't using their freewill to become economically productive. And, of course, the religious community becomes apoplectic at the thought of not being able to morally condemn the heathens. Searle's pontifications under the guise of intellectualism are nothing more than an attempt to cover up his fear of his own total lack of destiny-controllability. Even the word "free" itself is an absurdity. There is nothing in the known universe that conforms to the concept of being "free". All known phenomena have causal relations to other myriad events and just because an abstruse phenomena lacks a detailed explanation does not mean it has become "free" from causal relationships. Searle is afraid that without the concept of freewill society will degenerate into some sort of anarchic hell. Searle along with the other philosophical preists of freewill are on the verge of extinction. It is only a matter of time before developments in neuroscience render the concept of freewill in league with the concept of a flat earth, probably within the next 50 years. Get used to it John you have no choice, literally. 
 After I read Erik Larson's wonderful book "The Devil in the White City" I was fascinated by the brief glimpses at Holmes' story. But this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment. The production is amateurish at best, complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of "Mondo Carne." With such a wealth of fascinating information available (court transcripts, etc) do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened? This man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. Truly disappointing. Perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of Holmes. This most certainly isn't it 
 I am so sorry that I bought this book.  It is unfortunate that you do not have a Penguin or Everyman's Library edition.  First of all the book is too large to read in bed.  Secondly, whoever did the proofreading should be fired.  There are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading.  If the postage were not so expensive from Israel, I would return the book to Amazon 
 With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love.  This film felt like a "blind date" gone bad.  The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.  Everything in this film seemed wrong.  Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.  What initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose.  Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the cliché use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame.  Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale.  She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes.  I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors.  Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth.  Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally.  Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen.  I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character.  His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant.  I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.  Speaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film?  There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' "Looking at America" class.  I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film.  Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn.  There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about.  I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film.  He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for.  I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way.  Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well.  Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature.  Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story.  I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met.  I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.  Overall, I wasn't stunned by this picture.  I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just "played it safe".  The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin.  Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character?  I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters.  The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table.  I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further.  Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film.  The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old.  I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be!  Grade: ** out of **** 
 Walter Mosley is normally a detective writer, known for his Easy Rawlins stories. Blue Light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age. Various people in northern California are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird. According to the book's cover flap, the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes. However in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality. A smart girl becomes really smart, a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja, and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess. Mr Mosley is a talented writer. His prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable. Unfortunately there's little balance between good and evil, which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter. Even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting. There's a few great and captivating scenes in this book, but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself 
 The only reason I finished this book was it was a book club pick - I read a lot and it takes a really bad book for me to quit. This book is just never ending - no plot and a useless read. I can't believe so many people are giving it a good review. The constant narrative sounded like a neat way to write but it turned out very exhausting to read. Don't bother 
 If the book's title and the story behind the title were typed on one sheet of paper, you could post it and read it often to remind yourself that life is short, so live every day. For a few of us, that is how shallow most of our problems really are and therefore we probably do not need this book, just that one story. For many, however, their problems are real, their stress is real, and they are looking for real answers to help them live every day. Unfortunately, they will not find them in this book. Little depth and even less understanding or acknowledement of the real pain in people's lives leaves a "cutesy" book but not much help 
 I am by no means an economist, and much less an expert on finance, but this book strikes me as a thinly veiled, unsubtle hatchet job on the efficient markets hypothesis.  I've seen much subtler discussions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis written for general audiences, enough of them so I can recognize that Lowenstein doesn't get it; he equates efficient markets with "the price that the market offers is always the intrinsic value," and not with "you can't reliably predict intrinsic value any better than market prices themselves do."  This is a crucial difference, because it is only by assuming that market efficiency is the first that his attack holds water.  The other thing that makes me very suspicious about this book is the way Lowenstein presents the character of the various people involved in the story, given what his sources are.  Reading between the lines, I just have to wonder if his description of the personality and character of the people he describes as the core folks at LTCM is much too informed by interviews with people who've had a falling out with them 
 This is my opinion only. This diet is just to far out there.  For example it wants you to eat Free range eggs but not really Chicken eggs?  Come on.  The average person doesn't have access to eggs that are not from a chicken.   The General idea of the diet is a good one they just go overboard.  Basically it is a low carb diet made more difficult.  You would almost have to be a fanatic to have any luck with this diet.    
 Interesting experimental fiction.  In Big Trouble, Barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader isn't sure who the story is about.  Characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness, leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about--which is not the psychodelic frog.  It's something less original.  The genre is also well disguised.  Is it a comedy or a thriller?  If a novel is funny, can we take the thriller part seriously enough?  In some cases, yes.  When, for example, the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem.  In this case, no.  It's a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around, chained to an entertainment center, while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex-oriented crazy.  In all fairness, the novel does feature a ticking clock, which is handy to have in a thriller.  It's more effective if there is something believable about the story.  I expected a novel with an overdose of silliness, but I was spared that, which was a plus.  No characters with absurdly meaningful names.  The nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed.  While there was little depth to any characters, that's probably less of a requirement for characters  we want to laugh at.  The characters could have used some personality, but that's a common flaw.  The novel should have been funny in places, for a list of situations would show some potential.  But I had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout.  Others would disagree.  The politically incorrect portrayal of Miami was entertaining, if not actually funny.  The overall effect of reading Big Trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say, "Sir, I know your name is a household word, and I know we could make money on whatever you write, but I have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to...to something like this."  If there ever were such days.  
 I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.  For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents:  TRY THIS ONE IF... - You have a very abundant milk supply - You only plan to pump one or twice a month - You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period  INVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF... - You're going back to work - Your milk supply is medium to low - You plan to pump more than two or three times per month - You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency)  Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one) 
 As I read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by Mr. Cussler, the story was slow and the plot was transparent.     This book just didn't have the "zing" of the older Cussler stories.  If you are just laying around with nothing else to do it will give you something to read 
 The material is too stiff and forces the  pick too far out from my finger. It is also  more  'stiff' than a dunlop .60m 
 I still have not recieved this item that I ordered. I did get the star spangle shirt and love it but I have yet to have recieved this one and am not sure of who to contact about it. Please let me know how to go about getting it. I was under the impression I would have recieved it a number of weeks ago (it was part of a going away gift of my better half who is deployed to fight the war now) and still have not had word or recieved it.  Thank You, Holly Padill 
 Nelly's sophomore album was just as bad as his first one. The song Hot In Herre was a decent lead off single, so I thought that he might have came to his senses a little bit. Boy was I wrong. More singing and this time with Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child on the song Delimma and a song with Justin Timberlake. Now he makes a somewhat attempt to impress me by taking Beanie Siegel's Roc Tha Mic (Remix) and puts it on his CD, not to mention taking a shot a hip hop legend KRS-One. Another track worth listening to is #1 and possibly the only song that he has made by himself worth listening to. Everything else, just a big no no. Once again he has appealed himself to the people who hardly listening to rap, because I even hear that song with Kelly Rowland on oldies radio stations. This right here has got to stop, because I had enough of it. 
 The book is very simple and somewhat boring. I looked through the thing in less than an hour and now it's stuck in the closet. It does have some good aerial photos, but only a few. I was hoping the book would be a coffee table book for people to look through when they are over but it's now in the closet for who knows how long. It looks too much like an encyclopedia than a coffee table book in my opinion. The text isn't very well thought out either. Believe me, I'm an Urban Planner and so I'm interested in this stuff and have read a lot about sprawl, but this book just doesn't do it for me 
 The following comments refer to the second (1955) edition.  Let us hope the third edition is substantially improved.  A stuffy, dated, donnish, and relentlessly Anglocentric compilation, reeking of the classics curriculum at Oxford.  According to the preface, familiarity is the chief criterion for inclusion.  Familiarity to whom, for heaven's sake?  Professors of antique languages and literatures?  Horace gets seven pages.  Emily Dickinson gets two lines, as does Hawthorne.  Melville and Conrad get nothing at all.  "The horror!  The horror! 
 Normally I'm first in line for a romance book and have been known to like even the cheesiest of books but this one is, unfortunately, only worth one star.  The plot, writing and characters seem like they were created by a middle schooler. I couldn't even get into the storyline because I was so distracted by the horrible writing!   Truth be told, I only read two or three pages before I threw the book away. Just a pure shame. 
 You would think that a film with a top-notch cast, sumptuous visuals, and thrilling action would be a joy to behold.  You would think.  No pun intended, where did this film go off-track? For starters if you're going to make a heist picture you should at least make the participants likable.  We're really in Sean Connery's camp after he murders one of his henchmen.  The only apparent reason that Connery is given a hero's cheer at the film's conclusion is because the script dictates it to.  The heist is thrilling, but so what if the perpetrators leave you cold 
 Gary Zukav states in his introduction "I had never studied physics. In fact I didn't like science and I had no mathematical aptitude.  On Opra (TV) he admitted that he does not have a TV which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth.  I noticed that some reviewers refer to the "New Physics" is that like "New Age" or voodoo physics?   90% of the matter must be missing from this book. Or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. He even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose.   Many people say they did not understand physics until this book; Surprises, you still do not. You now know what Zukav wished physics was. Take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. And the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats.  At least get it straight before mixing it up. Try reading some of these: "The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski". The book available everywhere the DVD's available from the UK.  "The Upanishads" by Eknath Easwaran (Editor), Michael N. Nagler (Photographer)  Or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion.  Then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: "The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism" by Fritjof Capra.  Also on the fringe but not as radical as Zukav is a series called "What the Bleep." (both in books and on video) 
 This books gives you a lot of sites to see on your Road Trip but doesn't give you very practical advice how to get to them or their exact locations.  There are a lot better books out there 
 This book is one of Dean Koontz's worst.  Not as bad as THE TAKING, but right in there.  OK, here is the plot ... really, really bad guy kills girl and parents.  A girlfriend witnesses and escapes only to find herself in the hunt for really, really bad guy.  Girlfriend chases really, really bad guy and craters the guy, but that's not all.  During this (yawn!) high drama, the heroine finds a little girl that really, really bad guy has (yawwwwwn!!) captured.  After knocking off the really, really (yawwwwnnnnnn!!!) bad guy, heroine rescues little girl and adopts her. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!! Oops, sorry, I nodded off.  Please Dean, can you recall this book?  I mean we aren't asking for an apology here -- just take this piece of junk off the market.  I did see where "new and used" has it for as little as 1 cent.  Uhhhhhh!  DON'T SPEND IT !!! It is not worth it !!!!  And Dean, when you are going to give your email address out to the fans?  Most authors do this.....but, you seem to be reluctant.  Could it be literary cowardice?  Inquiring minds want to know.    Much of Dean's work is excellent ..... this book isn't.  Densel Myers Yukon, Oklahom 
 Bottom line:  I like Al Bielek's version of the PX better.  This one is more to the original story.  I like Al Bielek's personal account of time traveling.  This book is more about the "facts" of the account.  No Al Bielek in this book 
 Conservatives will probably dislike it.  Liberals will find it a good, fresh rally 'round the liberal flagpole.  I'm a liberal, so it was fun for me.  But have you noticed how the word "community" is becoming the new flashword among liberals?  "We are all in this together," says Mario, so we had better take care of ourselves.  Like Hillary Clinton's "It Takes a Village."  The use of "community" is like the use of "opportunity" by the conservatives.  Both are code words for points of view that, taken to their extremes, can be far more detrimental than helpful.  Americans ultimately prefer the middle.  Just remember that, folks, and no one will get hurt 
 The only good thing are the actors..not for good acting but for hot!! Really handsome guys 
 Wow, reading over the many reviews of 'Go Ask Malice', I wonder if these people read the same book that I did.  This is just about the newest book from the Buffyverse and it focuses on the life of Faith, pre-Sunnydale, told in diary form.  First, you have to get yourself to believe that Faith would even keep a diary.  Watching the series, you and I both know that this is not something she would do.  But, oh well...  what can you do?  Second, does this "diary" feel like Faith?  Not at all.  Save for the occasional Faith-related slang, it doesn't feel like her at all.  Does anyone really believe that Faith would sit around wondering about stuff like "Am I really just a scared little girl, wrapped in a hard, uncaring shell?"  While that may be the case, would she truly ask herself this question?  Of course not.  Thirdly, the book is just plain boring.  There's no real plot at all to speak of.  Every other entry in the book seems to relate to a dream that Faith has had, and while I realize that these dreams are important to potential Slayers, it does become a bit tiresome.  Then when you add in all the plotholes and irritating supporting cast...ugh.  'Go Ask Malice' is a snoozer.  Its boring and it just doesn't "feel" like Faith's inner thoughts.  I'm not sure why the reviews are so positive for this book.  This novel just isn't very good or engaging.  Not to mention, I just don't feel that it follows Buffy canon.  If people truly believe that this "diary" sounds like Faith, then they need to go back and re-watch the televison show and get a true feel for Whedon's "other" Slayer 
 Here's a long but informative review! Naturally since Bogle is the only one writing about early Black film stars people believe everything he says. He plays it safe by always talking about the same ole' stars that he talked about in his last books. Never does he introduce the public to unsung talents we never heard of. He spends most of the time talking about how mulatto, how light or how dark such and such is and how such and such couldn't do this or that because of this or that. When whites write on their stars they don't write about how blonde, how brunette or how red head someone was and how Irish or Italian one looked. Which proves how stuck on skin color Blacks really are! Why do Blacks feel they always have to spend time talking about race instead of giving these stars their recognition and due, forgetting how they look and telling of their life and versatile careers, who they really were, where they come from, making one reading feel like they knew the person all their lives, make one feel the happiness and sadness. Bogle spends more time on what they didn't do then what they did do. Which is sad, the public is missing out on a lot. So again, do for yourself the research and don't' depend on others all the time.  Bogle loves talking about how white Fredi Washington looked instead of writing about her extensive, incredible career, she done more in her life then most of us could dream about it, she didn't let others prejudices hold her back. She was no tragic mulatto, another stupid name, minus well call Stepin Fetchit a tragic ni**er which he wasn't, he was the first black millionaire and no more of a stereotype then Black pimps, gangsters of today who are getting rich off of it like Step got rich off of his stereotype. Fredi will be the first to say she had a great life and career. She wasn't sad or confused but a strong black woman. Bogle is no better than a white writer who puts down a black but thinks its okay to coin a book Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies and Bucks because he's black, I'm sure if a white titled a book that we be yelling racism, don't Black talents deserve a better title?   Bogle also plays it safe by always talking about Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, never telling the stories and never giving recognition to other black actresses like Nina Mae McKinney, Mildred Washington, Theresa Harris, Fredi Washington, Edna Mae Harris, Florence O'Brien, Louise Franklin, Daisy Bufford, Jeni LeGon Evelyn Preer, Suzette Harbin, Hilda Simms, Francine Everett, Shirley Haven and countless of others who had a chance to display their talents on the screen in Hollywood and helped fight discrimination and  help in the enhancement and betterment of blacks on screen but he gives all the credit to Horne and Dandridge, who didn't do as much as others if you want to get down to the truth, but I'm glad he don't talk about them in a way because he'll butcher up their life stories, I'll give them their due though. Many aren't remembered because maybe they didn't do as much, who cares about who has done more, were suppose to be remembering them for accomplishments and talents, right? White film historians sure remember all their stars, little or big. Someone like Louise Brooks, considered a early Hollywood icon is highly regarded as a great actress despite she only had a few good films and wasnt a big movie star. The woman is more remembered for one good film and a bobbed hairstyle but white historians will make sure you know her, her achievements and what she DID DO for the film industry.  Why can't Bogle be like that instead of criticizing everyone and judging them by white people's standards of what success and beauty is? I guess it's true that you gotta work twice as hard as whites to be someone in this world, whites can be remembered for little things, few successes, Blacks gotta have many successes to get rememberance and recognition even for other Blacks to remember them. Bogle is one of the few black film historians, you would think he would write more positively of blacks in Hollywood but he treats many worse then whites treated them when they were alive. Bogle never mentions Willie Covan and Marie Bryant (and appeared in movies also and was a good friend of Lena Horne's too) who choreograhed many white stars, they were behind the scenes but contributed to Hollywood. He suppose to be giving credit not taking away. Either Bogle is too lazy or likes to show favoritism because he sure won't tell other unsung talents stories. If he does he clutter it up with talking about their looks especially if he doesn't know how to write about them. Bogle knows nothing about the great career of Nina Mae McKinney, the first movie star of Hollywood and Europe, who done more films then any other black actress of her time, the first to appear on many magazines, she had so many achievements, yet he gives her one little page, if you don't know about a person, I rather you not write about them at all then to write lies. He never talks about the Black Cinema independent movie stars or the industry who was apart of American cinema, I guess their too hard for him to research, so he takes the easy path in writing about stars he already wrote about a million times. He never writes about Ethel Moses, Francine Everett, Dorothy Van Engle, Edna Mae Harris, Margaret Whitten, Tomiwitta Moore, Bee Freeman, Lorenzo Tucker, Monte Hawley, Ralph Cooper (created the first black studio in Hollywood), Oscar Micheaux, Spencer Williams and countless other black movie stars who appeared in films for blacks made by blacks in the 30's and 40's, I guess that's too mediocre for him but they done more for the enhancement of Blacks in movies by creating their own images, own roles, own portrayals, playing people from all walks of life unlike ones in Hollywood who were stuck playing the same types of roles and being the same images he always complaining about well I feel give due to ones who at least tried to do for themselves and become what they wanted but see they weren't cross-overs so their looked at as non-important by some which kind of dictated by whites who we should remembered and who's important. It's hard researching Black Cinema stars but boy it's worth it plus studying them, watching them perform gives you a good idea of who they were even if you can't find info on them. I still find the time to give them due and I'm no professional or anything but Bogle is a high class guy who only likes to write about Hollywood and his favorite gals Horne and Dandridge.   Ive done more research on unsung, forgotten stars then he has and it has been pleasurable teaching others on the net about blacks who contributed to stage and screen, stars who were just as important as Dandridge and Horne. I'm glad there are other people who are taking it upon themselves to tell the true stories of many unsung black legends and don't write in the same fashion as Bogle. Anyone who is hung up on skin color and don't want to think outside the box and like to hear the same stories then Bogle is for you but someone like me who researched many early black stars of stage and screen on my own and found out the real deal, found how they really were, found how they were really looked at, and found the true stories wouldn't appreciate Bogle's work much. I've talked with some legendary Blacks of the early years, some of their relatives also and they gave a completely different view then how Bogle describes them which shows he just goes by hearsay and documents and don't do accurate interviewing and researching.  I would think Bogle would spend more time on talking about the beauty of  black women from dark to light and  their wonderful achievements to the world.  Black women are quite unique but instead Bogle tells the  story of black women from white people's perspective it seems, he tells how black women were looked at from whites perspective not from a true black person's perspective that has pride for his race, maybe Bogle has a white person's way of thinking who is partial. Because I would commend these women, embrace and make the world embrace their beauty, courage, and talents; their many gifts to the world isn't as nearly written about as their skin tones are. He loves spending time writing about how light, dark or mulatto someone looks. Again, he makes it seem like such and such suffered because she was mulatto, light or dark, come on man, if she had a tragic life it was her own fault if she suffered. He makes it seem like color and race was the problem for everything which is false, actually many of these women profited from the race sometimes and plus women in general face discrimination, no matter what race or color. Don't you think these women went through enough being judged by skin tone or looks, they wished in their life for being to judge their talent, at least give them that now, Bogle doesn't. Who isn't discriminated against in this world? Bogle makes it look like Black is a curse when these female performers change the world and introduce the world to their greatness and the greatness of the race. He loves talking about whether someone should of passed for white or not like when he's talking about the great Fredi Washington. He misses out on showcasing  other great talents like Valaida Snow, Blanche Calloway, Una Mae Carlisle, Eunice Wilson, Adelaide  Hall and  others but that's okay because they have  been written  beautifully about by other writers. Well, many are dead so they cant stick up for themselves and Bogle takes advantage of that, he hasn't even interviewed or actually talked to ones who he writes about, he just goes by hearsay. Have your favorites but when you write a book, you can't show favoritism which he does all through which hurts others who has a story to tell but he only give honor to his faves. It seems no black can make him happy, he always has something to criticize. In his words every Black woman is a tragic, confused mulatto and every black man is a coon, or some other stereotype, he wouldn't say that to the young black guys or gals in entertainment today though, he takes advantage of the dead who can't stick  up for themselves.  There is a website on unsung black talents of stage and screen, you all will enjoy. http://www.angelfire.com/jazz/ninamaemckinney/ 
 This is just a biased one sided book, that states that all things wrong to the Shias have done by Sunnis. The author's claim are quite far fetched as to blame all the wrong things that happened to Shia's on Sunnis and their ulterior motives against Shias. However the larger problem that I have with the book is this. This book will only grow more divisions between people in this case muslims. The world doesnot need more dividers. The world needs unifiers who are woroking towards peace, harmony and unification between different faiths and different sub sects.  
  I decided to read Blue Latitudes after reading a review from an Amazon "Rate It" patron. It suggested that Blue Latitude was a far more superior book than Over the Edge of the World. Since I thought OVTEOTW was one of the best books I ever read, I'll give BL a read;the longest chore I had to endure this year. Spare yourself 
        Being a Molecular Biology major, I decided to try out an Evolutionary Biology course.  I came across the text book of Futuyma and I regret it.  This text was very poorly written and my T.A.'s, as well as professors, always had to correct student's interpretation of what the book was trying to convey.  In my opinion, for every 10 pages read, only one paragraph was coherent and useful.  From my experience, including many others, this book was horrible and was sold quickly after the semester of Evolutionary Biology was done 
 Hitchens can be a very sharp, insightful writer. A good mind well-stocked with infomation, history, and taste. This book, however, seems to have been thrown or pasted together as a piece of pulp writng, not up to his often very high standards of erudition and wit. Try reading his "Why Orwell Matters" for a glimpse of the real Hitch.               
 This is a fantastic book for those people who are slowly losing their grip on reality. While some of the basic underlying concepts are good I don't find myself practically applying the concept of psychic prisons to my organisation, nor do I view my staff as ameobas that make up a large organism. I have to admit though that I know of others who found the paradyme of organisations as instruments of domination highly arousing 
 This book might be a lot more helpful if it were updated regularly. The current--third--edition is from 1986, which is ludicrous with subject matter this volatile. The content itself is a bit too brief, but would still be very helpful if it had been done some time in the last 1-5 years 
 this book is a slow read, has some decent info, but its outdated and definatly not a fun read.  my college has made this book a standard issue for college level reading and i truly think thats a bad idea. my main reason is because the verbs used in this book are consistant and confusing, and a new one pops up every other word. definatly dont waste your time with this POS, your better off reading the back of a cereal box 
 My problem is, is that I didn't read any of the books. But just ordered one & waiting on it. I do feel that the people who think Michael Schiavo was thinking of the best interest of his wife, was only for his own personal needs. He wanted to move on with his life, he should have done it in a different way. He should of turned everything over to "Terry Schindler's" family. I am a CNA, and I have taken care of people who have had feeding tubes & did not feel they were in a vegetative state. When rolling them over in bed, from side to side as you are suppose to do every 2 hours, they look at you in different ways, they make noises if you ACCIDENTLY hurt them when turning them. They are people just like us. Just because Terry was supposevly running out Michaels money, that did not belong to him in the first place, was no reason for that Son of B*^ch to make her suffer the way she did. If Terry was going to die, she would have died a long time ago.....ON HER OWN!!! She was just to strong of a woman to NOT GIVE UP!! And as far as I see it, there is no reason to rate any of the books if you had followed the NEWS. That's what I did. It didn't take Michael to long to find another woman and move on with his life, no matter if he was there with Terry everyday. Michael was just lucky enough to find another woman to put up with that, or she was just looking for the same thing Michael was looking for. And I feel that was the rest of Terrys money, so they could enjoy there life with Terrys money. I think i've said enough......everyone needs to remember, "What Goes Around, Comes Around!" Michaels day is coming & when it does......Terry will be waiting! 
 Ok, I admit I'm a dummy when it comes to wireless networking.  This book, overall was not very informative.  Many times the step by step instructions provided were difficult to follow and didn't match up well with what was shown on my PC screen.  There is a ton of "fluff" in this book, I wish they would just cut to the chase and provide clearer step-by-step instructions.  This book really did not help me much.  
 "Three pigs" in particular, with characters Leo and Nina, is really pretty bad. I don't know how Prose has established such a reputation, but I know I don't want to read any more. Her lack of  conceptualizing a work at the beginning, of being unable to make fiction  beyond the tiresome and hideously predictable musings of these characters,  really attests to mediocrity, not brilliance 
 The only good thing in this movie was Ms. Howard's performance, she is innocent and believable.   I can't understand how good actors like Weaver, Hurt, and Phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this. The 'plain' dialogue among the 'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted.  And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.   If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.  I agree with others, I would have worked better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.  Rent it first before you buy, and save some money for a classic thriller, like Psycho 
 This book is not what it appears. It is a defense of Woodwards assesment of Nixon and watergate and attempts to imply that this is what brought down Clinton. THAT IS NOT THE CASE as Clinton was not only a lier but clearly immoral. There is no way Mr. Woodward can cover his Political leaning with this type of story. When you read this book it clearly is 50% Clinton and defending his and Hilary's actions under Whitewater and the Clintons' misconduct in the Whitehouse as President. In all fairness to Mr. Woodward this book is far below his standard of fair and honest reporting. Let admit it, this is no more than a defense of his reporting on Clinton and Nixon 
 The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a "normal, good" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along. 
 I bought this book thinking that I was going to get an extensive commentary about Alice In Wonderland.  This book is by no means an in-depth commentary on the piece.  There are no more than ten pages of commentary in the whole book.  The rest of the book is just the actual text of Alice In Wonderland with large side-margins that occasionally include definitions of words or phrases.  Definitely one of the worst book purchases I have made in the last few years.. 
 I felt cheated after getting half-way through this book,which I will not bother finish!  It seems as if the author simply wants to talk about himself and his works, not give information on "How To Write" 
 I worked my way through this,and kept asking myself why. This book is the product of a certain mind set in this country that props up certain points of views and tries to silence others, there simply is no other way to explain how this got published and, pick my jaw up off the floor, a movie made.  The writing is totally uninspired. Likewise the, uhh...plot. If there is a character, meaningful dialog, descriptive passage somewhere in this thing, please invite my attention. Swofford accomplishes only one thing: makes you real happy you don't have to spend time with him other than when you are struggling with his book. It doesn't matter how you feel about war, politics, life, or anything, this is just hard labor. Yes, I've done my time in the military and in combat. Swofford can't tell anyone anything, about the Corps, any military, combat, life, or putting one foot in front of another each day. Sadly, I think that this is a tragedy, because he had the opportunity to experience much, some of it even positve, but he missed it all. The people who put their names on the cover of this book and gave it favorable comment are dispicable 
 Wow, what a bummer. I was really looking forward to this book. I enjoy science-cyberpunk-fiction-y type books with female protagonists, but this was sad, sad, sad.  First, the idea. The idea just isn't good enough, or at least, the solution to the plot isn't good enough. Gibson clearly loves suspense, so he writes as though really exciting things are happening, even when NOTHING IS HAPPENING AT ALL, and the hero mainly feels nervous. It makes for tough reading. The characters that you are expecting to hook up never do. There's a weird side story thrown in that has NOTHING to do with the main story.  The main character is supposedly good at figuring out what "works" in advertising, yet is allergic to certain brands, will barf at the sight of a Tommy Hilfiger logo, and has a pathological fear of the Michelin Man. Not only would someone like this not be able to work in advertising (even on a consultant basis), but the fact the Gibson is unable or unwilling to explore this idea branding and logo identity beyond something that the protagonist simply "gets" is really annoying.  Save your time and money. Not that a used version of this book is expensive or anything.  I've read Sweet Valley High books (not recently, of course) with more interesting plot lines and narratives 
 If I could give this zero stars I would -- and honestly, it deserves a negative amount of stars.  Lots of people are saying this game is bad because many of the answers on the cards are incorrect.  Major problem right there!  But regardless, this game is terrible anyway.  My husband and I got it for a wedding present and it was highly recommended by some friends of ours.  That's the last time I'll take their advice for sure!  The only people who would enjoy this, in my opinion, are people who enjoy watching paint dry.  Most boring game in the world!  All you do is take turns reading multiple choice questions -- and most of them aren't even interesting.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY 
 Mr. Neuharth is indeed a sad and cynical man. He equates 'elitism' with critical thinking and casts himself as a man  of the people, just listening to their opinions via his polls and town meetings. And yet he talks of his fancy jets and other staples of his lavish and selfish lifestyle 
 While this book gives some helpful information I was overwhelmed by the detail.  For me it takes alot of the fun out of making and enjoying homemade bread. As one who has been successfully winging it for 25 years, and experimenting with different recipes, the detail in this book, I believe, makes bread making more akin to rocket science than something to do on a weekend morning so one can have some tasty homemade bread with dinner.  Keep it simple, keep it fun 
 I bought this cookbook because I liked the idea of having a week's worth of recipes.  I was disappointed when it arrived because most of the menus seemed more like 'kiddie meals" instead of family fare.  Maybe I'm in the minority, but I don't usually eat chicken nuggets for dinner.  Anyway, another complaint is that Brook Noel relies heavily on dijon mustard, which I like but don't usually use to the excess that she does.  Her mainstay dish seems to be chicken spread with mustard,  dipped in breadcrumbs, and then cooked in a skillet.  This recipe appears several times in the cookbook under different names.  She adds dijon mustard to just about any dish including pasta and sauces.  My last complaint is that I often add a vegetable to her menus, since they are not always part of the meal.  I think if you want to have dinner on the table quickly, the Rachael Ray books are better tasting, more wholesome, and a better buy for your money.  Don't waste your time with this book 
 My son loves Cars and is collecting each of the Matchbox type cars.  He said he wanted a Mac, so I found this one on-line.  I was extremly disappointed in the truck, especially for the price.  It is cheap plastic and the trailer doesn't not click onto the front of the truck.  Therefore, it pops right off all of the time.  It would be better if the truck was either one piece or would snap together so as not to fall apart by a slight touch.  
 I didn't feel that this was his best work.  I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes.  Too much detail on mundane stuff.  Suspense picked up on Tape 6, but wasn't the same type of suspense like "PREY".  Enjoyed it, but would've liked more suspense 
 Unlike Cussler's other series, I found this first story of the "Oregon Files" slow going at first and rather confusing. There are just too many things going on (no problem, I suppose, for multi-taskers!) and way too many characters to keep track of. Also, there's little to no character development even of "Mr. Chairman", Juan Cabrillo. The fact that he and his companions are mercenaries (with a penchant for good deeds that pay well) doesn't compare favorably with the NUMA heroes. However, the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides I expect from Mr. Cussler and co-writers. I look forward to the subsequent Oregon Files with high hopes.  
 This book is such a downer.  Besides the ridiculous sibling rivalry between two grown-up sisters, and all of the complicated problems between Julie & Romeo's families, we have an eight-year old, Sarah, running the show in Julie's house.  Besides watching Charlie & the Chocolate Factory endlessly, she manipulates adults in to buying her lottery tickets!!  They have their very own Veruca Salt living in that house!!    If you want to read a depressing story about an extremely dysfunctional family and a woman with no backbone, this is the book for you.  It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first one.   
 Actually my son loved the book but it fell apart as did all the similar Star Wars books.  (He is not hard on books, our pop-up books all survived his early years intact.) I bought a copy for the library at my son's elementary school and that one fell apart too.  These books are to expensive to have the binding be so shoddy 
 It is usually a bad sign when there is a guide included to explain the movie makers reasons for making the movie and to explain the lesson they want to teach.  The movie does give you a conclusion for the anime.  There is little to laugh at in this movie, the directors are to focused on making their point.  They have decided to make the anime and movie more "real" than the manga and as such have lost the light hearted humor and in their attempts to be "realistic" have created inconsistancies that can not be explained.  The music and animation are excellent.  But I would recommend buying the soundtrack and renting the movie 
 The amount of praise given to this work does not surprise me given that there is a widespread, yet subtle, socialist movement in America as well as in Europe.  Despite this, the book is a failed attempt at reconciling the ideal with reality.  Rawls commits one of the many age-old flaws of collectivism, attempting to force morality on immoral beings. Rawls' entire work is fundamentally flawed in that the hypothetical situation from which the entire theory relies, selectively allows certain knowledge, assumptions, etc. while conveniently eliminating others.  For instance, empirical evidence that shows capitalism outperforms other economic systems cannot be known in the original position.  This is profound when one considers that we live in a hostile world that requires nations to invest in security of which economic power is imperative.  Thus, capitalism may be a necessary injustice in order to safeguard liberal democracy.  If we compare the human condition prior to capitalism, one can see that perhaps a collectivist system that may contribute to capitalism's downfall is immoral, if it leads us back in this direction.  Consequentalism perhaps?  Despite this, the people in the original position cannot have this knowledge.  Therefore, information that is direly relevant to the construction of a social system in a hostile world cannot be used in determining its structure.  Somehow though, the people do understand the important of the right to vote, equality, etc. This is absurd and impractical.  Rationale beings need to analyze as much information as is available and pertinent to any decisions they make.  Rawls continuously attempts to explain his "tweaks" as rationale but it is obvious that they are all implemented in order to discount human nature and proceed in theoretical terms.  On a side note, Rawls' first principle calls for the right to vote, what would his state do if citizens began to vote for a more capitalistic system that defied his "justice"?  Iron fist?  Nevertheless, it is quite obvious what Rawls is attempting here.  In a hypothetical situation where we all have to fear being born without intelligence, strength, status etc. we will take the safe route and ensure ourselves the highest index of goods.  This may be true, or it may not (human nature seems to embrace risk taking) however this situation is irrelevant because of its exclusion of relevant information.  Hobbes for instance accepted human nature and the potential for a wide array of circumstances in his hypothetical Natural Condition.  While Rawls may have some strong arguments in declaring that his two principles are the epitome absolute justice, this does not mean they are practical in a hostile world.  Essentially, what Rawls is saying is that none of us deserved to be born intelligent, responsible, hard working, but that we were simply lucky in the natural lottery.  Because of this arbitrary distribution, he believes that we all must compensate for those unfortunate souls that were born unintelligent, lazy, and perhaps even immoral!  I'd admonish Rawls not to attempt applying his insane reasoning to the criminal justice system (Poor, unfortunate murderer).  If Rawls believes that the laziest, dumbest, and most immoral person still deserves a living wage despite not working, he has contradicted himself in that this justifies slavery, forcing individuals to work for other individuals without compensation.  This simply cannot be justice as "fairness".  Nevertheless, I'd recommend it to all free market advocates simply to strengthen their positions.  As a warning however, be prepared for a work that lacks brevity, organization, coherence, and most importantly, reality 
 This item worked for a while, but required fiddling (unplugging and replugging repeatedly) with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car.  Eventually, however, it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets.  Don't waste your money on this piece of crap 
 I picked up this volume because its title suggested that it would encourage hands-on science activities     that are essential to good teaching and effective learning. Unfortunately, I discovered on reading it that     the author combines a deep antagonism for the scientific "establishment" with credulity for numerous     fringe ideas. The first experiment that he suggests tests the hypothesis that your pet uses psychic powers     to tell when you'll be home for dinner! Sheldrake frequently presents anecdotes as "evidence". The "do     it yourself" promise of the title is broken for the reader who doesn't intend to begin raising homing     pidgeons or doesn't happen to work in a laboratory capable of measuring the physical constants (such     as the speed of light) to nine significant figures. Far too few cautions about the pitfalls of psychic     research are given (in chapters about the feeling of being stared at, or "feeling" the touch of a severed     limb). Despite the nearly fatal flaws of the book, I liked a part of its message, that important science     can still be done by amateurs. That's about the only aspect of this book that is commendable 
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 I was HORRIBLY disappointed in this book. I look forward to Debbie Macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically.   Not this time. Chrissie was a pain in the neck, and the way Susannah handled her relationship with her daughter (allowing her to whine and blackmail her) almost forced me to stop listening to the book in the mddle. Her mother's sudden change of heart concerning her move to assisted living was almost laughable, except that this is a very real problem among people of my generation and I would have liked to have read a little more believable solution.  There is hope, however. Susannah is buying a flower shop on Blossom Street in Seattle. Could it be that she and Lydia Hoffman (The Shop on Blossom Street and A Good Yarn) will meet and appear together in a future publication? If so, I hope it's better than Susannah's Garden 
 Ned Holness, aka Carlos Mencia, is well known, amongst comedians and followers of the art, as a joke thief. He's not even a "beaner," he's half German, half Honduran. He's, in short a poser, a liar, and a thief.  You're better served checking out who he lifts from (namely):  1. Joe Rogan 2. Paul Mooney 3. George Lopez (an ACTUAL Mexican 
 How could a great director like Tim Burton take a concept that is slam dunk good and change it so much as to kill it this bad. While it does have some good points most of this mess is just wrong. Allowing the humans to talk makes the hunting of them more cruel than in the first films when men were seen as cattle and pest. Talking humans did in the series and this movie as well. The apes come across as just cruel hunting and killing speaking animals and this sinks this turkey fast. A real let down and waste of tim 
 I've been a fan of Bruce Campbell for a long time, ever since seeing Army of Darkness and Brisco County Jr. actually. In the early nineties Bruce Campbell burst on to the scene with an original and fresh personae that was side-clutching, rolling on the floor hilarious at times. I remember being devastated when they stopped producing Brisco County, and then so excited when they announced Jack of All Trades. I didn't get to see the Jack series though as it wasn't carried in my area. I decided to rectify that last month and order the series as a kind of an early Christmas present to myself. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. I am not sure whether I would have found this series funny or entertaining a dozen years ago when it was released, but after watching the first two episodes I just didn't care to watch any more of them. I felt that the half hour format didn't permit any real character development or permit them to write any really interesting plots to build on the Wild, Wild West promise of the show. Or maybe it is just that I am older and my tastes have changed. But, for whatever reason, the show did not grab me at all and I don't see myself wasting any more time watching additional episodes. I love watching Bruce Campbell, but the magic of Brisco County, Jr. just didn't seem to be present in this series. If you are a real Bruce Campbell fan though you might go ahead and give this a try. Just because it fell flat for me doesn't mean it will for you. I think Bruce Campbell is a one-of-a-kind and maybe I just hit this on a bad day. Long live Bruce 
 I did not find the information in this book to be accurate or helpful. 
 I got this product for my daughter.  The password feature was difficult to program and the voice recognition was so precise it was almost impossible to reproduce the right voice inflection and pattern for the journal to recognize.  My daughter often could not make the journal open. After a frunstrating week or two, she stopped playing with it altogether 
 This book begins with the absurd claim that 'the natural numbers -1, 2,3, 4 etc- appear to have been present at the birth of the universe; part and parcel of the original material from which was knit the ever-expanding continuum of space-time.' The author does not explain in whose mind these numbers are supposed to have appeared or how a concept can be present without a mind to concieve it. Like many mathematicians he seems unable to grasp that mathematics is a language. Thus it's not uncommon to hear ridiculous statements like 'the universe is governed by mathematics' As if numbers exert forces. But this is the first time I've encountered the claim that numbers existed prior to life!   
 1994 William J. Bennett wrote "The De-Valuing of America: The fight for Our Culture and Our Children", 1995 followed " The Children's Book of Virtues", 1996 "The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral Stories" as well as "What Works: William J. Bennett's Research about Teaching and Learning", 1997 "The Children's Book of Heroes", 1998 "Our Country's Founders: A Book of Advice for Young People "as well as "Choosing The Right College: The Whole Truth About America's 100 Top Schools ", 1999 "The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals" as well as "Patriot Sage: George Washington and the American Political Tradition", 2001 "The Broken Hearth: Reversing The Moral Collapse of The American Family", "Virtues of Family Life: Stories from the Book of Virtues "as well as thirdly "The Children's Book of Faith ", 2004 "Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House", 2005 "The War Against Excellence: The Rising Tide of Mediocrity in America's Middle Schools" -- and so on: a true cloudburst of conservative forefingers lifted up fully, all publications, together just as stoutly as this Old Testament, Bible Part 1. Of course the one, who lectures dearest children and her moms at "what has to be believed in", does not like that pacifist, relativistic thinking climate, which is too characteristic of the intellectual elite at universities. He rejoices, that the academic world represents a minority. He is right with that. The majority can be conducted by third-class educationalists like William Bennett. Besides Christian false piety a clear sympathy with military solutions is part of this type of writing. Of course Iraq must be covered with war and if necessary, Iran also. The soldiers have to be admired as heroes. One does not have to think about this, why some countries on this globe like to criticize the USA. This undermines only the fight morals of the soldiers. The unutterable, one-dimensional arguing of this William Bennett indeed does not get beyond the standard of an armed forces parish priest. No book for universities or politics interested adults, but one for boys who would like to become once a soldier. One should read this book with the flag in one's hand .  
 Clive Barker produced but did not write THE PLAGUE...but what a stinko movie. All the kids in the world under the age of 9 go into some kind of vegetative state; ten years later they awaken and start killing people.  Why?  We are never told..and the ending is the biggest copout of all. DAWSON CREEK's James van der Beek frowns throughout the movie, and Ivana Milocevic just looks bored; the movie makes no sense whatsoever, so don't waste your time like I did 
 Living in southwest Florida in the area of much of the locale of this story I was constantly reminded of the tangle of the mangrove forests which are typical of the coastal waters of this part of the world and the Ten Thousand Islands in particular. Virtually impenetrable. So was the confusing mass of cracker family detail piled on the reader. One has to force one's way through it and the result is a pretty thin story at the end. However the author's tidbits of history about the area and the spoilation of the Everglades is of interest for those having some knowledge of and curiosity about the subjects. I also felt that this New York born writer carries a lot of his Yankee baggage with him which causes him to unload the usual northern liberal unsympathetic, vulgar, racist stereotyping of southern life of the past on the readers. Way overdone 
 In Edward Klein's The Kennedy Curse: Why America's First Family Has Been Haunted by Tragedy for 150 Years, there isn't much new here except for pure gossip, rumor and innuendo.    Klein starts off to make this a pseudo-scientific study of facts contributing to the Kennedy curse including lots of psycho-babble, genetic factors, etc.  He claims his book is a detective story.  He tries to show how "the Irish immigrant experience of poverty and humiliation developed into an obsessive lust for power and dominance over others at the expense of all ethical behavior."  Throw in domineering fathers, cold mothers, alcohol, drugs, sex, thrill-seeking behavior, ADHD, restlessness, boredom and impatience, and you get a prescription for tragedy.  Many people believe a black cloud has followed the Kennedy family for many generations.  It actually appears that the Kennedy's followed the black cloud on their own.    In trying to prove his curse theory, Klein spotlights seven family members including immigrant Patrick Kennedy, Joe Kennedy, Sr., Kathleen (Kick) Kennedy, JFK, William Kennedy Smith, JFK, Jr., and JFK's maternal grandfather, John Honey Fitz Fitzgerald.  He barely mentions other Kennedy's that have suffered tragedies including Bobby Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, and Joe Kennedy, Jr.  It was interesting to read about the immigrant experience of the Irish, as well as some of the lesser known family members including Kathleen Kennedy and Honey Fitz.  But overall, there isn't much new here, and what is new seems mostly rumor and innuendo.  For instance, Klein accuses JFK of having "chronic venereal disease" and claims it is possible that this caused the death of his pre-mature son, Patrick.  This is a pretty serious allegation to make without proof.  He also tells how Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's friends destroyed her drug stash after that fateful plane crash.  I don't believe the Kennedy's are saints and I know they've done some atrocious things, but give us hard facts.  Overall, my recommendation is to skip The Kennedy Curse.  If you want to read more about this fated family, there are much better and more comprehensive books to be had.  It is hard to believe this book was written by a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. 
 Tao Teh Ching is a monumental work.  Unlike other religious texts, the Tao Teh Ching is barely 5000 letters spread over 81 single-page poetic passages.  You can probably read thru it in a couple hours or less.  But for the serious reader, it can take a lifetime of study and contemplation.  In ancient times, scholars in China and Korea really did spend a lifetime on this one text, not only sudying, but transcribing it, discussing it, and abiding by its tenets in their daily lives.  I've myself pored over it many times in Chinese, Korean and now English, and every time I read it I cannot but be amazed by the wisdom of Lao Tse (or, as some allege, the group of people who contributed to this text).  The problem with English, or I suppose any language not associated with Chinese, is that it is almost impossible to translate Tao Teh Ching with sufficient coherency.  Chinese words are each and all very efficient, in that virtually every single "letter" is replete with meaning.  Therefore, whereas the Chinese may use 10 words to describe something, English might require 10 times that words to adequately translate the meaning.  For example, in the second passage, third stanza, the translated text says, "therefore, the Sage manages his affairs without Ado."  What does "without Ado" mean?  In chinese this is stated in two letters as "Mu Wi" - non-action.  It does not mean to sit back and not participate or instigate any activity.  Rather, "Mu Wi" means doing things in a very natural, spontaneous way that is not forced, does not create conflict and has no secular motives.  As there are no secular motives behind the action, it is as if the Sage does not "act" in the way other poeple act.  His actions are like breathing, and almsot imperceptible; thus it is as if he does not act.  Concepts like "Mu Wi" and "Mu Ji" - non-knowledge - abound in Tao Teh Ching.  These cannot simply be translated away with a couple english words.  In short, a Tao Teh Ching ranslation requires pages and pages of footnotes to accurately reflect the rich meaning behind every passage.  Moreover, many passages can be read in more than one way.  In fact, different translations sometimes say radically different things about the same passage precisely because of this ambiguity.  Any serious translation of Tao Teh Ching should point these out.  Tao Teh Ching is very concise, and written in a poetic style.  But unless you are versed in ancient Chinese language and tomes, you should really consult the literally thousands of guides that scholars wrote over the years to help you read thru the text.  Tao Teh Ching is not some kind of Buddhist sutra that you can just recite over and over without knowing what it means.  It is deeply profound and rich with hidden subtexts.  In China and Korea many of these guides - some of them more than a thousand years old - still survive.  I've yet to find an enligsh guide.  But I am sure they exist.  PLease find them; refrain from reading the translation by itself, for most times all you will see are a jumble of meaningless words 
 I used the first edition of this book as a graduate student in my econometrics class. The book is very confusing and hard to understand. It's still of no help to me now that I am a professor and writing research paper. Whenever I need a review in econometrics I use Judge et all; "The Theory and practice of econometrics." It is a better book, well written, and easy to follow. Unfortunately it is off print. We need a better book than the one by Greene. If it was for me, this book should be put where it belongs, in the garbage 
 I wish that tCoJCoLDS was as good at applying these principles as GBH is at writing them.  "He can talk the talk, but he doesn't walk the walk."  I'd be glad to provide anyone with details, andersandrobintronsen@yahoo.com  Love & Honesty are the Foundation of Christ's work here on earth, NOT endless, mindless details such as earrings, piercings/tattoos,'pretty' clothing: suits & ties, floor length dresses/skirts. It's thoughts of Kindness, Mercy & Forgiveness that count with Heavenly Father, NOT what we wear, how we look. Have a Great Day, God is Love.  
 I did not like the book, which is fundamentally flawed from the concept and proposition. Sorry to have wasted my time going through it 
 This children's book about Galileo has very beautiful illustrations, but the history leaves much to be desired.  It's a perfect example though of how myths about the past take on a life of their own independent of historical evidence or historical context.  Sis offers another variation on the "warfare" of science versus religion  with Galileo representing the modern rational scientist (which he was not) and his opponents in the Church representing ignorant, dogmatic tradition.  Of course the reality was much more complex, especially considering that Galileo did not have proof that the earth moved.  This book shows why children are so often misinformed from an early age for the sake of telling a good story 
 I purchased this dvd because I am a new fan of the Christopher Lee vampire films. Adapting the character to the groovy year of 1972 was not a bad idea for this film, but it was overdone. Still, it's fun, but if you if you are thinking of buying this film in hopes that it will be as good as Horror of Dracula or Dracula, Prince of Darkness, you may want to pass 
 Ehhhhh. What is this? This is one very stupid movie. How do I get a refund 
 This book started really strong and started dying about half way through.  The first half flowed pretty nicely, the authors all had very close styles of writing that made it really enjoyable.  About half way through, one of the big characters just disappeared and became a minor one, the styles of writing changed, sex and violence suddenly were added in what seemed like a PG-rated book, and the flow of events suddenly changed and left you confused.  At the end, things seemed to make some sense, but at the same time your thinking "What?" Started strong, ended badly.  Too bad too, I really liked Booger 
 The video certainly has potential, however as someone that has been working out for over 10 years this tape is WAAY too easy. I barely feel a burn while doing the ab workouts, and they are entirely too short. Perhaps if they were three times as long and did all four back to back it would be a worthwhile workout. But I have much better ab tapes that kick my butt with 5 minute segment(notably The Firm abs and Tamilee Webb ab tapes). If you are an advanced exerciser I say pass on this one 
 As a long time fan of Paula Deen, I was looking forward to another wonderful cookbook.  Not so for this one.  It has repeat recipes and if you're a regular of her show, many of the recipes have been on the show.  It has wonderful family stories, (which I don't need for a cookbook), and the layout and red font color is not cook friendly.  Overall, it was not what I would have expected in a Paula Deen cookbook and therefore I rate this one a big flop!  How many times can you publish gooey butter recipes 
 Well I have looked into different books on beaded flowers and saw reviews of this book so I went to my local library and requested it. Well when I got it I sat and looked through it while I did like how the instructions were simple and clear I did find it was lacking in projects I got a few of the other books out there and feel they are much better. I did love the galeray of flowers in the middle of the book and would have rather had the patterns for some of those flowers instead. I will say if you really want this book find it at the library and copy the first few pages in techniques and return it. Don't buy it 
 This is too difficult for my 5-year old to work. Initially I couldn't get it to work...it took 20 minutes of rubbing to get it to lick. Now I can get it to work much faster (5 minutes...still pretty long for a child) by rubbing EXTREMEMLY hard and fast. At first the tongue was not wet, but eventually after getting it to work several times, it did become wet (guess it takes a while for the water to work its way into the tongue?). Don't waste your money or disappoint your child 
 Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.  The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.  If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club" 
 No doubt the 4th turning was a refreshing revelation.  And the more dated predecessor Generations was a great secondary read.  From that I gathered there was a sort of synergistic relationship with each skipped generation.  Boomers relating to GI generation and Silent relating to the 13th generation, simply stated, a reciprocating bond of grandparents and their grandchildren.  Parents sure didn't like the antics and conduct of their children but they sure love those amazing grandchildren .  So it all makes sense that we get this tertiary and purely subjective read from Howe about what essentially are his darling grandchildren.  When I read about students turning in their teachers for espousing their pollitcal viewpoints I think millennial.  When I read about the yet to be calculated damages of Thimerosol in vaccines introduced in the 90's I think millennial.  Add ritalin and a V chip in the back of the neck and you get the ideal personae of a denizen of Huxley's Brave New World.  
 This was originally a fabulous 4-color printed book, but, it has been reprinted with very poor quality black & white photocopy looking pages. I contacted the "publisher" who basically said tough luck, this is business, and this is how we make our money. Buy it used!!! Because as you may have figured out, an art education book with low quality black and white examples is worth it's weight in beans 
 The book A Gathering of Days is a journal of a young England girl growing up facing some trials and tribulations.  The whole book consists of Catherine's journal entries about her happy, sad, and eventful life as a young child growing up in England in the 1800's.  The journal was given to her by her grandmother, which later Catherine passed down to her granddaughter.  Catherine experiences many difficult times as a child.  At the beginning of the book, Catherine's mother dies leaving her with her father and siblings.  Later in the story her dad remarries and Catherine has to get used to living with a new brother and step mom.  Her step mom teaches her many new things though that she never would have known, like quilting.   	The whole narrative is told from Catherine's point of view.  She describes through her journal her feelings and emotions that she is going through as a child growing up.  The story is realistic in such a way that young girls or even children can connect with Catherine as they may be facing the same situations that she does.  By reading her journal, children can also see what is was like to grow up in England and compare it to their lives.  The author does an acceptable job of describing the characters so the reader is able to visualize them in their head.  The story though is a bit confusing because it is written like it was back in the 1800's.     	The overall story was okay.  It was realistic in such a way because the reader could see what it was like growing up in England in the 1800's.  The reader could also connect with the main character as she describes her feelings and emotions. 
 it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read.  I read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about.  The writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read.  I ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over.  I know this is supposed to be for emphasis, but I just found it indulgent.  The lack of correct punctuation was distracting, too.  Had I read this when the book first came out, before everyone knew he lied, I would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of AA.  Although I have not attended AA or any similar support groups, I feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions, that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own, which in most cases I am sure they are not.  I found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than James Frey, and I can't say that I felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character.  Maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself....but I am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he isn't feeling so badly anymore 
 The characters in Pamela are not only entirely unbelievable and impossible to like, but are also incredibly long-winded.  Pamela is an infuriatingly self-righteous pricktease who can't seem to understand why her master, a disgusting mysoginist, gets excited every time she flirts with him.  Then she falls in love with him, inexplicably, and marries him.  Suddenly she becomes Ms. Submissive, begging her husband, whom she continues to call "master," to give her "more wonderful injunctions" to restrict her behavior.  She even seems thrilled when he hits her.  Richardson's writing is repetetive, boring, and entirely devoid of beauty.  His protagonists are either creepy or unbelievably stupid.  This may well be a candidate for the first English novel, but that doesn't mean you should read it.  If there were a zero rating, this book would receive it 
 I agree with the rest of the reviews.  I've read this series since its' inception, and enjoyed almost all of the books.  The sex has gotten stanger and more prevelant, but even through the last book it was still an adjunct to the plot.  This one however has nothing BUT sex.  No plot, no action.  If you took out all pages which contain sex you wouldn't have 5% of the book left 
 This book was immensly boring. I feel utterly stupid for having wasted my time reading this blithering mass of mindless jargon. This mystery did NOT keep me on the edge of my seat like it should have. The characters were poorly described and muh! What a waste! I'm just sorry that I couldn't choose to give negative stars 
 Man, these guys suck. I couldn't stand listening to the 30 second samples. Click out of this page and move on with your life 
 Newt and William are going to write a new book.  It will be called an Alternate History of World War II.  In it Germany will win the Battle of the Bulge BUT lose the war.  Their next book will be an Alternate History of the Revolutionary War, in it the Colonies will win.  Then they will together write an Alternate History of the First World War.  In this stirring book, the ALLIES WIN, THE ALLIES WIN. What is the point?  Also read Sidewalk Sam below for a fuller explanation of this lousy book 
 After having read Baldacci's "Camel Club" this one came as an utter disapointment.... the book starts off describing the assasination of a US senator and how the lead secret service agent in charge of his protection ended up out of the service and discredited for having lost his charge.... sounds like an interseting way to start the book; the main problem is Baldacci never takes the time to introduce any of the characters.... after a while i couldnt keep reading the book because i felt i didnt care for the characters enough... i didnt really care to know what happened next to them since i didnt really "know" any of them... it was like reading a newspaper article.... a way too long newspaper article.. 
 Never mind's that it's pretty stupid - "John Tucker Must Die," like a lot of movies about high-schoolers, actually hates high school and just about everybody in it, and by extension, American kids; it's the kind of movie that, if parents caught an hour of it, would make them think less of their children for watching it, and to a fearsome extent, pretending to live it out. Early in the movie one character, a cheerleader, remarks about stealing her mother's estrogen pills: "Well, guys use steroids to build their pecs." That estrogen will do the same for the cheerleader's breasts is laughable, but considering the hot debate of steroid use among kids - considering kids have died or flown into abusive rages while using them - that could be most casual, sickening line of the year.   But it is what to expect from Hollywood screenwriters in their 30s who write exploitative trash for money then have the artistic gall to call it mild, girlie comedy - not unlike those fabulous "Laguna Beach" hacks who use insidious, and I mean insidious, editing techniques to create faux docudrama among teens with facial expressions and confused responses clearly mismatched, again and again in the sloppiest manner, to the previous line of dialogue. "JTMD" asks us to believe that the title character (Jesse Metcalf) simultaneously dates three women (Ashanti, Sophia Bush, Arielle Kebbel) without them knowing it, is able to afford repeated dinners at the nicest restaurant in town, owns a great car, stays in four-star hotels for high-school basketball road games, and my personal favorite, owns and drives a yacht. He and his brother have no parents to speak of.  Neither do the three girls, unless you count the cheerleader's mom reference. One of them (Bush) is an avowed 17-year-old vegan vixen, however. And when they discover they've all been dating the same guy in gym class, they get in a brawl and are not suspended, but sent to a 23-minute detention without a teacher.  Is this a satire, as "JTMD" bills itself? An edgy comedy? A smarter, cleverer film knows that teachers hand out discipline, in this post-Columbine world, for looking at each other funny, and that a brawl would constitute the lead story in the six o'clock news. A cleverer film has the girls chase not a superstar athlete, but, say head of the drama club. A cleverer film recognizes teen humor is mined not out of blase, ultra-hardened brat girls, but sweet, emotional, sunny girls. A cleverer film would know a dark comedy, if that's what "JTMD" intends to be, can't have cheesy lines and yachts sitting around to be driven.  Instead we have a fourth, "smart" girl (Brittany Snow) is introduced as the girls' grand, "Taming of the Shrew" plan to woo John and eventually stomp his heart. This angel, of course, begins to fall for John, who is not particularly charming or interesting or anything beyond possessive and very wealthy, which are, if we follow our MTV, two of the trinity (the last being sheer, drop-dead cuteness emanating from those soulful eyes said guys must have, preferably brown) that makes up male desirability. Director Betty Thomas pretends that humor are four very different idiots insulting each other over the cliques they belong to. Ashanti gets the shortest end of the stick, adhering fiercely to the idea that cheerleading, in an empowered, open society that has a foreign Hindu woman as CEO of Pepsi, represents the canopy of female of achievement. Go figure - you break the glass ceiling with a cheer pyramid!  We've been pounding this Earth for years now. Why do teens and young women still trail along, lapping it up? There is no real wit in the movie that you can't see from some third-rate comic being fed lines on a VH1 program, no style, no genuine attitude. It's all buried behind this driving notion of painting a portrait of a catty, young, rotten, unidealistic America most interested in getting tail, getting even and throwing s-uh-weet hoopty-rah parties. It is not immoral so much as it blank, a double zero signififying an unceasing period of meaningless motions to mimic, most involving self-debasement of young bodies. What fools Hollywood sees our children to be, wants them to be. What numb, donkey fools. If you need more proof, Jenny McCarthy has been cast as the voice of reason - and she's borderline believable.   Ya know, so much ugliness is spewed about "Islamofascists," these manaical, stoneaged fiends who apparently can't tell you the sky is blue, spending most of their time taping martyr videos, finding Mecca and concocting devices to destroy our way of life. Consider, though, that one of the more recognizable items in Muslim countries is the satellite dish . A year from now, this thing's on a movie channel, and well, whatever evidence terroritsts thought they needed to chart the American decline into shame, they've got it. Not because it's absent morals, but humanity - the better for the terrorists to treat us as the faceless collateral damage they believe us to be.  
 There's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject, but Mr. Winchester abuses the privilege. There's no digression too minute, no reference too arcane, no place where one word can't be replaced with 100. When he does finally get to a set of pertinent points, the writing is excellent. That's what kept me from giving it a worse review. Too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of economy-brand mixed nuts.   If you're prepared to work your way through the innumerable detractions and root out the nuggets, the book is worth your time. Otherwise, pass on it.  
 this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha ga 
 Eugene O'Neill's play "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a Pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about his family. I must admit that though Eugene O'Neill is considered by some to be the father of American Theater, I did not enjoy reading this play. The Tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. I also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension O'Neill offered no conclusion. The day in the life of the Tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. No happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a wholly depressing read that I really could have done without. However, after learning more about Eugene O'Neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, I began to have a greater appreciation for this play. O'Neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair I felt while reading this play demonstrates O'Neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. While O'Neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as Eugene's own family never got a happy ending. I did like the clever way O'Neill showed the Tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. At the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. The audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. Slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. Thus showing that no matter how hard the Tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. Although I still believe "Long Day's Journey Into Night" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to O'Neill's exceptional writing.  
 Take Eugene Levy (Puhleez!), his former Canadian (R.I.P.)SC-TV alum John Candy and add 'Commando's' Dir., Harold Ramis and (!) James Keach (!!) to the writers and what do you have? An only moderately funny John Candy movie! There are some great bits in here - but this movie is  the greatest waste of space (make that talent!) since Greenland! Robert Loggia and Meg Ryan are wasted in stupid stereo- typical roles. And Levy with Ryan?! About  as bad as Billy (Clipper-fan, his only  redeeming quality!) Crystal with Ryan!  Or Tom Hanks! Lester did better here  than with 'Commando',but is that really  saying much!? 
 This book says it all. Frankly I'm suprised no one has mentioned these little inconvienent facts:  (BTW this book is free on the Internet)  * Look for the words "fox", "snake", you'll find ample references to fox sage and snake ghost, and spiritual posession. * Page 18 - Master Li mentions FLG can cure illness, and obtain over  10,000 other superpowers, including levitation.  Need I say more? Don't fall for Falun Gong's cultish teaching, I beg you. Is "Jesus only saves white peopele" cultish teaching? You decide. 
 This film is a documentary, not a movie.  For those of you who admire European films with honest, casual nudity, this film may not be for you.  European films with honest, casual nudity usually are non-pornographic in content.  This film brings the anatomy down to a degrading level.  If you want to view this film, fine, but be prepared for some tears and nausea.  This film is not for the faint-hearted.  Though here in America we do need to let loose our prudishness when it comes to casual nudity, yet, to Europeans who tolerate young children being victims of sexual exploitation I ask, where are your child protection agents, your social workers, your law-enforcement agents, your religious leaders and, for crying out loud, the parents?  I admire Europe's easy-going ways when it comes to casual nudity, whether on the screen or on their beaches, but when you view this film, you might think that a lot has to be said for the way we protect our children in America against sexual exploitation.  I cannot think of a more vicious, sinister crime.  I believe the body has a soul, only these young lads were cheated out of a healthy outlook on the body, let alone a normal, healthy childhood.  My poor heart just cries out to them.  I practically saw the devil through that pornographer in question. I was going to rent "Angels, But Not Angels," but this film, and "Mandragora", were enough for me 
 What Prince made so special in the 80ties was his abbillity to create innovative music and at the same time appeal to a big audience. Diamond and Pearls appealed to the crowd, considering the 2 million copies it saled, but there is nothing new or exiting to be found on it. Prince even becomes a trendfollower by introducing rap in his music (Jughead) And offcourse there is "Gett off", a nice funk tune, but like all tracks on this cd, very mainstream. Many of the singles that were pulled from this album became great hits (Diamonds and Pearls, Cream, Money Don't Matter 2Night), but they are also amoungst his most uneventfull songs. It shows that being a commercial hit does not equal quality. Only "Willing and Able" and "Strollin'" are showing a tiny glimpse of Prince's true talent and his willingness to experiment with his music. Prince made over 30 albums in his career (I'm proud owner of all of them) and I'm sorry to say this album belongs in the bottomhalf of his catalogue. It was one of his biggest commercial successes and the album sold millions of coppies, but it is also very "middle of the road". It misses spontanity and originality. What is left is a well produced R&B album (perhaps even overproduced), with a handfull of good songs. But non will leave a lasting impression or define Prince's talent. If you seek to be introduced to Prince music get Purple Rain, Sign Of The Times or Lovesexy instead.   
 I am a huge fan of Linda Howard's books. I have purchased each and every one of them. I live in Israel so getting her books in English from the U.S.A. isn't cheap Cover of Night was the most disappointing book of Linda Howard's I have ever read. It was boring and I foung myself turning the pages and looking for something interesting to read in that particular book. I hope the next one is more interesting. I will keep looking forward to her books since I have enjoyed and re-read many of the ones I have 
 I'd heard good things about this book.  This was a quick read.  I was irritated by the main character's low expectations in life.  When I was done with this book I was like, "what was the point of that?"  Enough said 
 Do NOT read any Nancy Drew books! They're boring and girly. If you want a real mystery, read a good one like Chasing Vermeer or The Witches of Worm. THIS BOOK IS SO STUPID, I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE LIKES IT!!! 
 It was so bland and uninformative I actually returned it, very rare I return a book, I can usually find something in it I like!  : 
 This is the most misleadlingly (is that a word?)titled movie I have ever seen. Amazing caves? What caves? The first 15 minutes of this reletively short 40 minute film don't take place in any cave. All they do is talk about them. Then when they finally enter a cave they are there for a few seconds. The few and far between cave scenes are interspersed with lots kayaking scenes, laboratory scenes, and classroom scenes. Was this film funded by the pharmasutical industry? The lead scientist in the film is always saying how she does this cave dwelling stuff to find exrtremophiles that will create new cures for diseases. Blechh! I wanted a movie about caves that showed beautiful caves. Granted, the latter half of the film provided more cave time but it was too little too late with too much of an environmental-disease-curing propaganda feel to it than I could stomach. It should have been titled "How To Search for New Cures in a Few Caves while Being Environmentally Conscious." Somehow I don't think that title would have sold many IMAX tickets or DVD's 
 This review is about the regular edition DVD, not the Criterion one.  The DVD is a piece of garbage. IT CLAIMS TO BE WIDESCREEN, BUT IT IS NOT. IT IS ENCODED AT A FULLSCREEN DVD RATIO WITH LETTERBOXES. Not only does this waste space, but it gives the picture actually a smaller resolution than it should have as a DVD. I wouldn't be surprised if they took a pan&scan print and chopped off the top and bottom, like the Back to the Future box set fiasco. I will be comparing to my friend's copy he taped off TV to see if it is so 
 These authors were brave trying to write a lasting hardcover on technology that dates faster than sliced bread. Sure, the information is comprehensive and tries to cover all technologies, but in such a general way that those of us with more than a skerick of knowledge will get bored quickly 
 If in reference for gods and goddesses, this is not the most informative book. I would have given it 1 star, but there were some decent illustrations, which is the only reason it gets 2 stars. It really reads like a very boring textbook, and doesn't go into too many gods and goddesses. It gives a lot of history about the ideas in celtic dieties, but not too much into specific gods and goddesses. Read at your own risk 
 I have read several Catherine Coulter books and I am afraid to say they keep getting worse !  I really enjoyed her writing at first; kept looking  for all of her stories. But after reading so many, I find the major  difference between each of her characters, especially the men, is their  names. There are a few unique traits perhaps with each of them, however,  they are so closely related they have become easily predictable. Most of  the men have been in the same situation, say the exact same things, treat  the women identically in every story, to which the women respond  identically in each...etc. This one in particular was the very worst, at  some points, I actually laughed at the silliness of the characters. I  really couldn't believe how ridiculous some of the dialogue was.I thought I  would finish the novel despite my disappointment but I just can't. I could  go on but there's really no point.  Ms. Coulter is a fine writer, I just  wish she would write a different story...maybe put some real effort into  it 
 I really enjoyed The Perfect Storm.  So, I gave Ms. Greenlaw the benefit of the doubt and started her book.  I was less than impressed.  I lasted till page 53 where I just ran out of patience with her plodding technique and her lack of story. This is a bad book attempting to ride on the tail of Junger's book.  Sebastian Junger's blurb on the cover was "Anyone who loves the sea will love this book"  I think not 
      There is no scientific basis for the "Mozart effect,"  none at all.  The experiment in question was conducted on adults, not babies.   The results of that experiment implied that the subjects actively listening to music immediately before taking intelligence tests performed slightly better on those tests because they were more alert than the subjects who had been day dreaming in silence.         Those seeking scientific papers thoroughly debunking this silliness will find them in "The Biological Foundations of Music," published by the New York Academy of Sciences (ISBN 1-57331-307-6), which is currently out of print, but is probably available at your local library.          "Music, the Brain and Ecstasy" by Robert Jourdain is an excellent introduction to music cognition.  Howard Goodall's "Big Bangs" and Dowling and Harwood's "Music Cognition" can be purchased used and will be appreciated by advanced musicians and novices alike.          Parents wishing to introduce their children (and themselves) to music might consider purchasing "Leonard Bernstein's Young People's Concerts," which are insightful and an absolute joy to watch.         Do not buy "The Mozart Effect."  It is a waste of your time and money.  Instead, just order some Mozart or Brahms or Bach, sit down, and listen to it:  you don't need Campbell's manipulative schlock to help you "unlock the creative spirit" within 
 With the caliber of musicians playing on this album, I expected a hard hitting original. Instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of "filler" salsa. No surprises here. The classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious, you'll play this one once 
 maybe 2 songs were good......... the rest nothing special. save ur mone 
 For all of the supposed 'resistance' built into this machine, it enables you to do  many -more- repetitions than you'd be able to do  of simple bodyweight 'core' exercises,(crunches, leg lifts, situps, and a multitude of others). Why is that, and what is the effect? 1/ Why : The resistance is -less- than the resistance supplied by the weight of your own body being moved around without any equipment. The so-called 'resistance' actually -assists- you on the return motion, the exact opposite of exercise.2/The Effect: You must do an incredibly high number of repetitions do get any effect at all, and it won't be much even then. High rep work should be full-body cardio , not isolated ab work. Ab work should be the same as any other muscle-building work : After you can do 15 reps , the resistance should be raised: Exercising the abs, obliques, other core muscles  to strengthen and build them. If an exercise doesn't get difficult enough to make you stop after a minute or so, it simply isn't difficult enough to do you any good. There is no such thing as spot reducing exercise. Modern ads know better than to claim the lie of spot-reduction, but they still strongly imply it. Why do they get away with it? : Because people never stop looking for an easy way out. The re-sale value of these gizmos goes down to around 5 bucks as soon as you own it. Why? : Because the market is flooded with as-seen-on-tv, home-exercise junk that's collecting dust 
 Just a warning - 8 minutes doesn't count warm up, stretching, or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise (something that I find really annoying and ineffecient!).  I have not read Jeorge's book.  I got the routine from an excerpt in O! I don't understand why he doesn't pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing - it's such a pain getting up and down, up and down.  Plus, I feel like you lose that whole idea of "no rest".  I'm sure I expend more calories to get up an down, but it's all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself.  I have been following WW while I have been doing the 8m workout (more like 10-15 for me), and I have not lost one pound.  I'll keep doing it, because it's probably better than nothing, but I'm not impressed so far (about 3 weeks) 
 If you are interested in the entrepreneurial world, you might find this book an entertaining read.  However, if you are an entrepreneur or want to be one, this book is most likely not going to help you.    I have read so many business books (including books on start-ups) and invariably with the exception of a couple of books, those for start-ups are of low value and do not provide sufficient information desperately needed by entrepreneurs.    With so many fluff books on start-up companies and entrepreneurs, there is a great need for more in-depth how-to books.  This one certainly has not bucked the trend.  It seems that so many of the reviewers are just so proud and honored to speak of Mr. Kawasaki's previous stent with Apple or his garage.com firm (which I still do not think he is sure what their mission is) that they have not given the book a truly subjective and unbiased review.    When reviewing a book for entrepreneurs you should ask yourself the foillowing question:  Does the book really show you how to be successful?  Is the information so valuable that you will study it and take notes or refer back to it for future use?  There are very few sources of valuable education for entrepreneurs anywhere.  Therefore it is important that the authors of these books provide what is left out in business schools.  Traditional business topics are covered well in business schools so there is more room for business fluff books.  Despite this fact, there are still many books on traditional business topics.    In contrast, for entrepreneurs, the only source of education is the book market so you should stay away from fluff books or motivational type books, all of which teach you nothing.  
 I generally like and admire Faulkner's work, but this novel (or whatever it is) got the better of me.  Usually I make myself finish any book I read no matter how difficult, but with "A Fable" I simply couldn't do  it (and I've managed the entirety of James Joyce's "Ulysses" and  Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past".)  I may have a Master's  Degree in English, but I still had great trouble following what was going  on in the book, much less appreciating what it was trying to say.  It's  amazing to me that the Pulitzer Prize committee could even manage to get  through this thing, much less give it an award.  I haven't given up on  Faulkner, but for the first time since I was a college undergraduate, I've  given up on a book.  It took "A Fable" to bring me to my knees 
 The Da Vinci Hoax by Olson and Miesel  The following clarifications are structured such that they first present the contention listed in The Da Vinci Hoax (DVH), the page number, and reference data that counters the contention. The Da Vinci Code is abbreviated DVCode in the following discussion. DVH selectively quotes some statements by Bart D. Ehrman that supports DHV premises and suggests he is a reliable authority. The assumption transferred to the reader is that Erhman supports the DVH authors. DVH ignores other statements by Ehrman either because his books were not read carefully or in their entirety. In the discussions that follow, I reference some of these other statements. The reader is urged to refer to Ehrman's texts and Teaching Company Courses for more information. My personal observations are printed in italics. A bibliography is included in the last page.  DVH in response to the DVCode's premise that what we perceive as historical accuracy has been  influenced by history's  winners p 27, "is nonsensical since it rests on the premise that `accuracy' is in the eyes of the beholder and therefore cannot ever be objectively gauged".  Ehrman - Lost Christianities p 47 "As with political and broad cultural conflicts, the winners in battle for religious supremacy rarely publicize their opponent's true views...And so, in early Christianity, as we have seen, most of the writings of the losing side in the battles for dominance were destroyed, forgotten, or simply not reproduces for posterity - in one way or another lost.  DVH p 122, and 123 "...the depictions of Jesus in the four Gospels are filled with concrete, historical details ...the historical evidence that does exist upholds and supports what the New Testament describes." Ehrman - The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture Introduction "My thesis can be stated simply: scribes occasionally altered the words of their sacred texts to make them patently orthodox and to prevent their misuse by Christians who espoused aberrant views. ...these scribes `corrupted their texts for theological reasons." Ehrman continues in his text to describe in each chapters a different heresy and then discuss "the textual variants that appear to have been created out of opposition to" each. The point being that what we have passed down to us in the New Testament should not be interpreted literally as `historical'. In fact we have very little independent evidence to support the stories in the New Testament that were handed down by oral tradition and, in the case of the Gospels, only written down 30 to 60 years after the death of Jesus.   DVH p 58 in response to verse 114 of the Gospel of Thomas "But Brown never bothers to have his characters quote from the final verse of the Gospel of Thomas". P 59 "The Gnostics, then, equated being `spiritual' with maleness, hardly a pro feminist perspective."   DVH is interpreting the passage in light of modern day understanding of male and femaleness and not in the context in which it was written.  Ehrman - Lost Christianities p 63 "... in the ancient world, the world of this text, people generally considered gender relations differently than we do...For ancient people, male and female were not two kinds of human: they were two degrees of human"  p 64 "and so, salvation for this Gospel of Thomas, which presupposes a unification of all things so there is no up and down, in and out, male and female, requires that all Divine spirits return to the place of origin." Which is similar to what Paul says in Galatians 3:28 "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus"   DVH concerning the canonization of the NT books p 65 "In fact, there was already a growing consensus about the entire New Testament cannon by the middle of the second century" and implies this occurred before the Gnostic gospels were written. The dates listed on p 64 for the Gnostic gospels range from 120 CE to as late as the fifth century. Ehrman - Lost Christianities P 230 "the first Christian author of any kind to advocate a New Testament cannon of our twenty-seven books and no others was Athanasius, the fourth-century bishop of Alexandria. This comes in a letter that Athanasius wrote in 367 CE...there was no official, churchwide pronouncement on the matter until the Council of Trent in the mid-sixteenth century." Many of the Gnostic and other "heretical" Gospels existed before the canonical Gospels were finalized.  DVH concerning the Divinity of Jesus DVH p 69 " if first followers of Jesus did not believe he was divine" Implying that they believed he was divine but Mark, the earliest Gospel does not state He was divine but that he was the "Son of God."  DVH p 66 "Why should the writings of the Gnostics be considered more dependable than the canonical writings, especially when they were written some 50 to three hundred years later than the New Testament writings?" Ehrman - The New Testament and Other Early Christian Writings General Introduction "The earliest New Testament book is 1 Thessalonians written sometime around 50 C.E. the latest is probably 2 Peter written around 120 C.E...At about the same time the Gospel of Thomas appeared, as did the church manual called the Didache and the apocalypse know as The Shepherd of Hermas. These other works were not included among the books of the New Testament when the canon came to be fixed in the fourth and fifth centuries. Yet they also represent writings of the early Christians. And many of them, at one time or another, were considered Scripture. The purpose of the present work is to collect all of the earliest surviving Christian writings in one volume. For the purposes of convenience, the term `earliest' refers to the first century of Christianity, 30 C/E...to 130 C.E. or thereabouts". The reference book lists 12 Gospels, 2 Acts, 14 letters attributed to Paul, 21 Epistles, and 3 Apocalypses for a total of 54 writings, half of which did not make it into the canon.. The canonical gospels were written 40 to 65 years after the death of Jesus p 9 Matthew was written 80-85 C.E. p 40 Mark was written 70 C.E. p 60 Luke was written 80-85 C.E. p 92 John was written 90-95 C.E. All of the early Christian writings were written down from stories passed on by oral tradition.   DVH p 76 concerning references to Mary from Magdala in the four Gospels - DVH lists 2 references to Mark 16:9 Ehrman - The New Testament  p 72 Mark "ends with women fleeing tomb because they were afraid." p 73 "some copyists of this Gospel were so put off by the ending (Mark 16:8) that they added one of their own, appending twelve additional verses that describe some of Jesus appearances to his disciples" The point being the references at the end of Mark (starting at the quoted verse) 9) were later additions. Some scribe added the verses to make it more similar to Luke. It is surprising that DVH would quote a verse that most scholars agree was not original to Mark to prove a point.   DVH p 112 "There is clear and copious evidence that the early Christians, dating back to Jesus' time on earth, believed that Jesus of Nazareth was divine." DVH p 117-121 lists 9 authors of the second to third century that purport to believing in Christ divinity but he dismisses other authors of the same time as not dependable as they were written after the New Testament writings - see p 66 response. Can he have it both ways? DVH later states on p 171 However, in Jesus time the term "Son of God" did not refer to a divine person; it was a messianic title ...As time went on and the early Christians recognized the divinity of Jesus the title naturally took on a deeper meaning - the meaning the council of Nicea (325 C.E.) would ratify. The data DVH lists seems to contradict. If you can't trust the heretical and Gnostic writers of the second and later centuries, how can you quote these authors' views. Ehrman - Lost Christianities p 254 "As time went on and proto-orthodox Christians came to believe that Christ was both divine and human, they needed to explain how that was possible. Near the end of the second century, one of the common solutions was that Christ himself was God the Father, come to earth in human form."   DVH p 123 concerning the historical evidence of Jesus "the historical evidence that does exist upholds and supports what the New Testament describes." p 167 "The historical claims of Christianity about the person of Jesus of Nazareth are based on historical narratives ... the witness of the early church, and increasing amount of archeological and scholarly evidence. Bart D. Ehrman The Historical Jesus Part 1 p 17 Scholars have come to believe that some of the stories of Jesus life in the New Testament Gospels are historically inaccurate ... because compelling evidence exists to do so. The evidence is of two kinds: (1) some of the accounts are told in more than one Gospel and, when these are compared with one another, clear discrepancies emerge, and (2) some of the accounts are implausible when looked at with a careful eye to what we otherwise know about history." p 20 According to Mark, Jesus lived through that day (Passover), had the Passover meal with his disciples that night, and was put on the cross the next morning on the day of the Passover itself. In John's Gospel, though Jesus was executed before the meal even began." So Jesus was either crucified on Thursday or on Friday depending on what Gospel is read. p 20 concerning the birth story "Where, for example was Joseph and Mary's hometown originally? Was it Nazareth, as in Luke, or Bethlehem and in Matthew." ... we have relatively good documentation for the rein of Caesar Augustus, but no mention in any sources of a worldwide census. ... Quirinius was not governor of Syria during the reign of King Herod in Palestine but ten years later." So the historical evidence not only contradicts some of the events of the birth story but the two versions in the Gospels contradict each other.  DVH p 133 referring to Teabing referring to Constantine as "a lifelong pagan" states that this was not true. Later on p 142, DVH inserts the quote that "pagan referred to persons who had not been baptized." Earlier on p 139-140, DVH states that he "was baptized by Eusebius, the bishop of Nicomedia. He (Constantine) died a few days later." By definition, Constantine was almost a lifelong pagan because he was not baptized until a few days before he died. The text within the DVH defines and supports the statement in the DVCode that he was a lifelong pagan until a few days before his death.  DVH p 144 "the depiction of a `hybrid religion' that mixed together Christian and Pagan elements misrepresents how Christians took certain symbols and feast days and Christianized them, cleansing them of those elements not compatible with their doctrines and practices but keeping what could be used for good ends." What is DVH definition of a hybrid, if not that? This situation could easily be described as a hybrid. p 148 "but the Mithraic beliefs and practices that Christianity is accused of "Stealing" did not come into vogue until the end of the first century at the earliest, far too late to shape the Gospels and their depiction of Jesus." As stated earlier, the Gospel of John was written in 90-95 C.E. and Matthew and Mark in 80-85 C.E., which seems to be pretty close to the end of the first century when the other practices existed.  DVH p 159 implies that Christians began worshiping on Sunday and not Saturday after the death of Jesus. ... This was to honor the day that Jesus rose from the dead having been crucified on a Friday, Jesus rose from the dead on he third day - the day after the Sabbath, or Sunday." But he later says on p 160.Justin Martyr, writing in the middle of the second century, makes the first known reference by a Christian author to Sunday "; all prior references had been to the "day of the Lord". And later on p 163 "once Christianity had separated from Judaism (especially after the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in A.D. 70) and emerged as a unique religion ..." Many early Christians celebrated both days with Old Testament observances on Saturday and other Christian observances on Sunday. DVH implies that Sunday worship was established shortly after the resurrection and then there were no Saturday observances.  DVH p191-192 "the only person with a proper claim to being the living Grail is the great Mother of God, Mary Most Holy." This is presented without any evidence or proof, it is just his opinion.  DVH p 197 in references to the documents supposedly supporting the DVCode "Moreover if these documents were first century originals, they would have been written in the form of scrolls, not pages. How likely would they be to survive a millennium of storage and several more moves across Europe during the past 900 years." Bard D. Ehrman The New Testament - A Historical Introduction to Early Christian Writing p 448 shows a picture of the front and back of "P52, a fragment of the Gospel of John ... discovered in a trash heap in the sands of Egypt. This credit card sized scrap is the earliest surviving manuscript of the New Testament, dating around 125-150 C.E." This is Papyrus written in the form of a codex. While it isn't first century, this second century document definitely received rough treatments and does exist. The early Christian documents adopted pages as their form of writing. The timing of the transition was complete by the second century and pages did exist in the first. Scrolls were not the only form.  DVH about the Virgin on the Rocks p 254 "Brown's interpretation then takes on an even stranger turn, as Jesus and John the Baptist are misidentified. He writes that the Virgin Mary sits with `her arm around an infant child, presumably the Baby Jesus ... Art historians and scholars have always understood that the infant on the left, under the arm of the Virgin Mary, is John the Baptist. ...Why does Brown transpose the identities of the two infants? So he can write that instead of the `usual' depiction of Jesus blessing John, ..." Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia "The London version also contains attributes missing from the Louvre version, notably haloes and John's traditional cruciform stick. These clarify the identification of the babies Jesus and John, and were added by another artist, probably after Leonardo's death. ... However this difference may well be explained by the possibility that the distinction between Jesus and John was thought to be insufficiently clear in the earlier picture because John is with the Madonna, and that the pointing gesture directed too much attention to John." It appears Brown was referring to the Original painted by Da Vinci and located in the Lourve and not the reinterpretation in the second London version. One might ask why would Mary be leaning towards John and cradling him in her hand instead of her son? Why would the angel have to support Jesus?   DVH p255 has a long discussion about how Langdon is wrong about the identification of Jesus and John. "Brown must grasp at straws-and apparently calculates that most readers will not examine reproductions of the two paintings for themselves."   But in the Special Illustrated Edition the two pictures are printed next to each other on page 147 for easy comparison by the reader.   DVH in reference to the Virgin on the Rocks and The Last Supper p 258 "the Vigin's left hand bears more than passing resemblence to the right hand of Christ in the Last Supper..." Visual comparison of the face of Mary in the original version of the Virgin on the Rocks (below on the left from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_of_the_Rocks) and the figure to the right of Christ (below on the right) bears more than a passing resemblence. The figure appears more feminine that masculine. We will never know what Da Vinci's intention as he did not write it down. It is left to the viewer to interpret the art. Interpretation then is only opinion. "Experts" do not always agree.           DVH p 271 " If Peter's motion with his left hand really were so threatening, why does the figure lean toward him with complete trust?" We do not know if the figure was originally leaning and then the threatening gesture occurred. Besides, who would feel threatened sitting next to Jesus who could raise people from the dead. The text continues "The motion, in fact, conveys trust and intimacy, which would be expected of a relationship between two disciples Peter and John." These comments are the authors as there are no references to other sources and are actually quite a remarkable for the authors to recommend such an intimate relationship between two men.  DVH regarding the disembodied hand p 272 "The dagger is being held by Peter...Almost every art book we consulted mentions that the hand is Peter's ..." On careful examination of the original image after removing the "restoration" paint (from http://milano.arounder.com/category/fullscreen/IT000005356.html) Peter is wearing blue and the crook of his elbow leads down to a brown hand to the left of the dagger hand. Follow the sleeve down to the hand as illustrated by the arrow. Peter's hand is circled. The hand holding the dagger has no sleeve and is behind Peter's hand as seen in the ellipse.           DVH p 280 As the past chapters demonstrate, there is no lack of evidence for stating frankly that the Da Vinci Code is filled with errors big and small." I have not referred to the extensive bibliography that the authors include in the back of the book. I have several of Bart D. Ehrman's books and have access to the Internet references and I found inconsistencies in these sources with the authors of the DVH book. I wonder if the other sources were consulted, would they also reveal additional errors. If the authors discount a book that contains errors, what opinion should the reader of this book have about the accuracy contained therein?  DVH p 296 "It is also strange that the novel is presented as a thriller but is rarely, if ever, thrilling."  Checking the Amazon.com site reveals that it received 3.5 out of 5 stars in 3067reviews. The Da Vinci Code won best book at the British Book Awards and was on The New York Times best-seller list 18 weeks. Not everyone found it thrilling but many did. It resulted in many questions and a flood of authors who were compelled to write their own books aimed at debunking the DVCode.  The DVH book contains many of the authors' personal opinions that are presented as facts. This difficult to read book presents as a well researched scholarly study that proposes to expose the errors in a book of fiction. The DVCode has embellished some historical facts and proposed conspiracy links. Based on the definition of "conspiracy" as a secret act with a coverup, it is very difficult to prove a conspiracy theory as truth or falsity after the fact and the available evidence depends on how well the secret is kept.   Was Jesus married? There is no compelling proof either way. As DVH states about Mary's bloodline on page 102 "even if there were some validity ... what would it matter?"   I ask you "What would it really matter if Jesus were married? Should that diminish your faith?   Methinks the authors doth protest too much.    Reference Material  Bart D.

 I completely recommend this book if you like being underwhelmed, or if you want to be whipped into a catatonic stupor. If you must read it, get it from the library so you won't feel like you did when you bought the Ding King from the TV commercial. (As for the writing style, I'm not sure our president can push a subject against a predicate, at gunpoint.) If this was written by a ghostwriter, he or she should be taken out and shot.  As for the veracity of the text, don't believe it. Karen Hughs, the probable ghostwriter, called up Bush's former national guard base after he became governor, or the national guard's commander-in-chief. She told the commander she wanted to be able to check his records. Translation: I'm going to purge anything bad about him before I write his book.  George's words ring as hollow as his vaunted national guard record and his smirking heir of superiority. This book says that he continued to fly for a number of years, which was patently false. After his two million dollars worth of training, he tried to get a slot in the Air Force post office of another base in Alabama. He was turned down. Then, he refused to take his flight physical. Flight physicals are orders, not requests. Years later, Karen Hughes would tell a cowed press that Bush didn't take the physical because his personal physician was in Houston. No one questioned that these exams are given by Air Force flight surgeons, period.  This book was not only inaccurate, but dull and too self-serving. I recomment it only as a Christmas gift for a person you only pretend to like. (Don't forget to add drums and trumpets for his or her children too.) The collapse should be total.   By page 5 this book was by my bedside as a cure for insomnia. (A Charge to Sleep.) If you have a choice of painting on New Year's Eve and watching it dry, or reading this, go with the paint.   If someone gives this to you, change your home phone number. It can only mean he or she really doesn't like you.  Look for this book in a clearance bin near you.  
 Glitter was pretty on my pastries but I was under the impression it would be flavorless and it actually had a yucky aftertaste 
 I have seen Julia Ormond in some good movies and she is a great actress. This is not one of them. Senseless subject. The audio is bad, or the language is not what I am used with, so I understood only half of what they said in the movie. Stay away from this one 
 I was guided to read a few books about Mary Magdalene these past few months.   The relatively short story Joan Norton shared with us in her book was an added confirmation of the special bond between two historical figures whose lives were distorted by too human narrow views. This is a touching, intensely personal account of the power of their love 
 Berberian's work is one more example of why writers, especially first-time writers, should write about what they know intimately.  It is painfully obvious from his ponderous and endless recitation of his character's physical training techniques and his love for particular kinds of foods, that Viken has nothing else to talk about.  Existentialism?  Hah!  More like pedanticism.  Berberian's characters are flat, uninteresting, and tell us nothing new about the Mideast.  Where is the conflict in his characters?  Where is the multi-layered (and therefore believable) mileu of the cyclist's world?  Where are the characters that could provide an alternate perspective on, or at least discuss, the objective reality of terror?  Most unforgivingly, where is the drama?  Pass on this author, until he decides to write about something he at least sparingly knows, and doesn't have to research from square one 
 I've had this toaster for four years now. It just started going down hill recently.  -It started toasting too darkly on the settings I had consistently used for years.  -The digital setting knob no longer works, it is stuck on 4.  -It only shuts off when manually popped up.  I have to agree with other reviews that said it doesn't toast very even. I've noticed this in my four years of use.  So if your willing to pay the price for it to last 4 years get it. If not, try another with better reviews 
 I would not buy this album because the bass fiddle is TOO LOUD and over-rides the pianist.  
 The curiously gifted songwriter Stephin Merritt is best known as the guiding force behind several acclaimed indie-pop groups -- most notably The Magnetic Fields, who amazed, delighted, and sort of overwhelmed us all with the three CD collection 69 Love Songs (and then followed up with the underwhelming album i.) Over the past few years, Mr. Merritt has also written songs for three music theater productions by Chen Shi-Zheng, and Showtunes is jam-packed with 26 of them.  These tunes encompass everything you love (or perhaps don't?) about Stephin's songwriting -- they are clever and witty, compact and concise, tuneful and cloying... and a bit precious at times. There's one major problem however -- Stephin isn't singing any of them.  Instead, the Showtunes are (appropriately, I guess) performed by vocalists and choruses from "the original casts" in a mannered, over-enunciated, Broadway-esque style that sounds more like Gilbert & Sullivan than The Magnetic Fields. And sadly, I couldn't stand it.  Maybe listeners more enamored of musical theater than I am would not be as distracted by this (I can't stomach Cole Porter songs sung this way either.) Besides, the arrangements are fantastic, using unconventional ensembles that convincingly blend Asian instruments with lute, autoharp, accordian, marimba, and steel drums -- thankfully without the electronic clutter that sometimes intrudes upon Magnetic Fields productions. (Happily, a few instrumental selections are sprinkled throughout the CD.)  But unfortunately, all I could think about while listening to Showtunes was how much better these songs would sound if they were sung by Merritt's soulful, resonant, unpretentious baritone voice instead. And I suspect that many of his other fans will feel the same way, hoping as I do that Stephin has worked through this musical theater phase once and for all.  In the future, if he combines the formidable songwriting and orchestration skills heard on Showtunes with the sincere and direct vocal performances that graced so many of the 69 Love Songs, I expect to be amazed and delighted by Stehpin Merritt again and again.  Meanwhile, be forewarned: The Magnetic Fields meets The Mikado may not be your cup of Oolong tea 
 I bought this case for a Sony Vaio SZ140 after seeing a spotlight review saying that the Vaio would fit perfectly inside. I ended up returning the bag for a refund for two reasons:  1. My Vaio (13.3" screen) was just slightly too big to fit in the case. The case itself is very well padded with thick foam. I probably could have forced it in, but it would definitely have taken some forcing. I'd guess a Macbook would fit better.  2. The case itself is just too bulky. I bought it looking for a sleeve that would protect my notebook while carrying it in a backpack or messenger bag. This case is very large for a sleeve and would barely fit in my bags. True, it comes with a shoulder strap, but if you're going to use that you might as well go with a regular-sized bag so you can carry your power cords and other accessories.   This case seems to have trouble making up its mind whether it's a sleeve or a regular notebook bag, doing a poor job at either. It's too big for a sleeve and too small for a bag 
 My Krups FME1-14 12-Cup Coffeemaker developed a terminal leak after 2 months, so it was too late to return it or the 4 extra filters I'd bought for it.  I do hate wasting money 
 First, to debunk the product description, the most terrifying "Jaws" ever will always be the first. Nothing after that is even in the same league. And this chapter continues the devolution that started after the ending credits of the original, topped only by "Jaws 4- The Revenge," in being worse. "III was originally released at the theater  in 3-D, which didn't improve it by any stretch, rather made it more of a novelty. In viewing in non-3D release, it's even worse because you can see how the director catered to the 3-D scenes, which are obvious when you watch it now. The acting couldn't be more "made for TV," as can be said about the whole storyline, the scenes and the deception freely utilized by the camera and director. This is one of those movies where you constantly find yourself scoffing, "Yeah, right!", when seeing many of the sequences. Even the very ending of the movie caused us to laugh with contempt when exiting the theater. Once again, another movie, regardless of how bad it is, I peak at it occasionally when on the Dish just to watch Lea Thompson, even though her acting in this one is nothing for the time capsules. The same can be said of the whole cast in fact, including, shamefully, Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar winning "Officer and a Gentleman" role. He couldn't have a more annoying, over the top, archetypical character. I hope the check was worth it Louis. There's nothing nearly as suspenseful, dramatic, or engaging as the original. There are no characters that you really care about- there's no depth, merely posturing by the characters. And the climax' plausibility is an insult to one's intelligence. This movie is just plain bad. In that it can be worth a watch alone, just to take pot shots at the absurdity of it all and to see how far down making a buck had dragged down the once proud brand name of "Jaws. 
 Surprisingly 9 out of 10 galleries in New York are NOT looking for new artists. This book is for a buyers market, those looking to make an "investment", which is the sad state of art today. If you are an artist looking to break into the N.Y. scene it will only be good as a gallery guide. Borrow a copy or get it cheap 
 The unit did not recieve or transmit half the distance that was reported across a flat surface.  100ft. would be pushing it 
 While there is some interesting information in the book, it seems to be riddled with errors and sloppy research.  It also has quite an amount of bias - for example Strathern says that the three greatest economists are Marx, Smith and Keynes.  Marx isn't even an economist.  Further - 'Franklin D. Roosevelt, the greatest president of all'.  He might have been a reasonable president - but the greatest of all??  The Great Depression didn't prove Keynes right.  Actually, the New Deal slowed the growth of the US out of the depression (see for example the recent International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook 2002 (recoveries and recessions).  There are many other errors in economics understanding. (This book is titled 'Dr Strangelove's Game' in Australi 
 I was very excited with such a inexpensive purchase for high count sheets, but very soon I learned it was not such a great deal.   Beware if using them on an older mattress which is not thick!  After putting on the fitted sheet, it looked like a huge skin on a baby elephant!  Loose material everywhere.  My real complaint is the pills, which appeared only a few days into use.  They snag on rings, watch bracelets, etc.  I would never purchase this material again.    
 I wonder if Jance wrote this just to get a movie credit based on her novel. One cannot help but be suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write in a Tom Clancy or John D. Macdonald style just because that's what film-going audiences like. I do not think this is a bad thing, but I, like some of the reviewers here, are so fed up with clich? plots that just borrow from i.e., Macdonald's "Cape Fear," or use that tired Native American romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets through the roof. As for her writing style, she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown. What we're left with are people who are one dimensional like both the Walker parents, Davy, his fiancee, and to some extent, Lani, who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding Medicine Woman. Her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone-challenged. The men in this novel just weren't credible when they spoke. I kept seeing Jance speaking for them. So we're left with a high-concept piece that is still waiting for Hollywood to call and possibly star Penelope Cruz as Lani Walker. What's the Tohono O'otham word for "2 thumbs down?&quot 
 This blender comes with the battery unit that sits on top of the removable motor which sits on top of the blender shaft. This makes the unit entirely too tall to apply the proper pressure and very uncomfortable to maneuver while on the stove or counter. I tried using it for whipping up some potatoes and the power proved too weak to do an adequate job. Sorry Cuisinart. This is quite a disappointing product 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 As an avid reader of Early American history and a native Pittsburgher, I was very excited to read about the Whiskey Rebellion. I already knew the basics of the conflict, but I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into a well researched account of this often untold piece of history. Sadly, Hogeland's book was a far cry from solid history. His Marxist interpretation of history was a first let down. Hogeland cannot see past the economics of the situation. Certainly, economic issues were a driving force behind this rebellion, but to see the 2 camps as "popular" and "creditors" seems disingenuous. He overly favors the rebellion without seeing the wider implications of Hamilton's policy. He misreads critical issues such as assumption, the excise, etc. All in all Hogeland can tell a good story (he is a journalist), but as an historian he leaves a lot to be desired. My advice, buy another book 
 This guide is missing secret character moves and how to unlock them. No other secrets or krypt info was listed either 
 This book, though very informative, is taken from so many other already available sources that it reads more like some student's book report. The  most inaccurate passage being that Jeff in "The Killer" wears  white gloves like Jeff in "Le Samourai". I own "The  Killer" and do not remember seeing him wearing gloves. Also,  Christopher Heard claims that some scenes from "The Killer" match  "Le Samourai" shot for shot. That is completely untrue. Obviously  Mr. Heard has not done his homework and thoroughly researched his subject  matter. All in all, it is an interesting read if you are unfamiliar from  where some of the material is plagerized 
 Unfourtunately, after the anticipation was over. I started into the program and found it never really got moving. It was nice to see Joe talk about things and demonstrate some things, but it didn't meet my expectations of Joe Morello. Thought he would of been more technical. For a begineer this could be a good DVD. 
 I did not find the author's arguments for faith to be at all compelling.  Examples used a "evidence" in many instances were simply the opinions of people whom the author interviewed while preparing for the writing of the book.  The case presented was also extremely biased with minimal, if any, counter arguments being presented.  The majority of "experts" interviewed were of the clergy, so how would one expect those people to feel about faith 
 ...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.    John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.    A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.    It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.    It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.  Watchable, but barely.  The Player covered this terrain so much better.  
 this is big, he does what he does and says in the ripped my pants episode. you have to see the episode to understand the toy. great for the spongebob fan. only thing is that his body is made of very thin plastic like 3 latex balloons stacked up texture and what it looks like and feels like. the child needs to be old enough to not push the button over and over and to leave him alone when he is doing his thing and not to keep moving him. it is more of a novelty for the biggest fans, not a toy.I am glad we got it as fans but if not good as a gift to young kids to play with

 This kit is just junk. The "deluxe blower brush" is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. There is a "tweezers" that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. There are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. The "lintless cleaning cloth" is an about 3" x 5" piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. This kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges 
    It has become common for those with political agendas to try to obscure those agendas by presenting them in books that appear to be a combination of scholarship and plain old common sense. The authors of such texts have clear agendas, yet want to distance themselves from "special interest groups" and appear as a neutral, disinterested parties who are just being helpful. This is one such effort. The author has a clear anti-public education, pro-voucher, anti-funding agenda that shows up in discussions of a broad range of issues.     The real problem with this book is that the author relies on scant evidence and weak analysis, including hypotheticals, to try to refute what he portrays as "myths." His review of the Star project on class size (which ignores other collaborating studies) is an excellent example. His critique of the issue of small class size is extremely poor and can only have one motivation - to oppose increased funding for public schools.      Throughout the book, Mr. Greene selectively picks through data, presenting it in charts and graphs in an attempt to give the book an objective, scholarly feel, while repeating the theme that teachers do not need more pay, schools are not underfunded, vouchers are a form of school reform, and private schools outperform public schools. In doing so, he actually perpetuates several myths, such as the myth that, as a group nationwide private schools outperform public schools.       I tend to dislike books that lump common perceptions and research-based concepts together as "myths," but I dislike them even more when the "myths" are "debunked" by opinionated statements posing as scholarly conclusions. For example, in the chapter on vouchers, the author states that the evidence conclusively shows vouchers are successful. This is not a factual statement, it is an opinion. Mr. Greene, don't present opinions as facts, your readers are smarter than that.        This book will not shed any new light on these issues to anyone who works in the field of education. It is a poor choice for someone wishing to understand current educational policy issues due to the author attempted to hide his clear bias. There are no alternative solutions offered. Mr. Greene's interpretation of the research ranges from simply repeating what is well known to highly opinionated statements presented as facts to being simply incorrect. His analysis of current research is flawed and incompetent. I do not recommend this book and wish I had not wasted my money 
 a Sniper is a highly trained sharpshooter or marksman, the word sniper has nothing to do with a murderer..!! Snipers are military or police personel who deserve great respect ! 
 Why did Mr. Bernstein come up with such a meager product?--as though someone with an "in" suggested, "Hey, there's a commercial niche for a small book on Jefferson.  Give it a go."  I wish he hadn't.  He gave little substance either to Jefferson or his book and made factual and interpretative missteps in the bargain.  Save your money. 
 If this is the book of the film, god knows how bad the film is. I worship B5 but being in Britain we have not seen the TV version. This was a terrible hactchet job of hashed together bad ideas that lead nowhere.  Thirdspace was very good, but this is awful 
 this video is nothing more than artistic license with the Scriptures.  My family was amazed at how many points we found in the Scriptures that were DIFFERENT than what was said or acted out in this film.  We REALLY enjoy other parts of the Bible Collection films, such as Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David, Solomon, Jeremiah, and Esther.  BUT THIS ONE doesn't deserve to be named off with the B.C. set (nor the Sampson one).  If you want to see some common yet erroneous doctrines presented, then this film won't bother you.  The only part that was continously Biblical was the tension between the political religious parties.  All else was corrupted and shoved together incorrectly.  Finally, the "artistic license" taken where you see Saul/Paul go from being a wrestler, to the full naked backside of the characters, to a single nude breast of a woman later as her and hubby go to consumate, and the buttocks hanging out of a few others along the way....well, it was embarassing to see such unholy material guized under a holy subject and Biblical atmosphere.  Simply put, the story of Saul/Paul was "hollywood-ized" in this film....great liberty was taken, inappropriately.  Don't buy if you want Biblical 
 I read this book for leisure over the summer, and i was completely underwhelmed. Reading reviews of it one gets the impression that it should be a very good look at Shakespeare and his work. I found it dry, almost like a text book. For anyone intrested in Shakespeare I would not reccomend this book, it is dull. 
 Does anyone even care that the "Author" John Miller, formerly of ABC's 20/20 and then the head of counterterrorism for the LAPD, is currently the Assistant Director of Public Affairs for the FBI in the BUSH regime...I mean...Administration.  This book is Propaganda. Period 
 In a story that should be familiar to anyone who has seen or read The Big Sleep, a old dying billionaire charges a pair of detectives with the task of tracking down his daughter, who disappeared under highly suspicious circumstances. The detectives, Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, aren't the first ones who have tried to find her - that is Desiree Stone, daughter of Trevor - in fact, the man originally hired for the job vanished himself not long after claiming with great certainty that she was still alive.  Dennis Lehane crafts a spiraling plot where you wonder if anybody at all is telling anybody else the truth about anything. There is a cult-like group preaching some sort of church message somehow linked with a grief counseling center, and Desiree may have been a member of either or both of these groups... or was she? All of the events surrounding her disappearance are highly suspect, so much so that our detectives aren't even sure she exists at all. And if she does exist, just what is her agenda? Some say she was seen with a dangerous man named Sean Price, but does he exist? It's a big confusing mess for Kenzie and Gennaro, but a page-turner for the reader following along closely.  In the end, though, this book turns out to be fairly predictable, despite the twists that Lehane works in throughout. It's an effective detective mystery, but fails to capture on anything other than a visceral level. I enjoyed it a lot while I was reading it, but nothing really stood out for me after I completed it. If you are familiar with the standards of film noir, none of the twists will surprise you too much, although they do hold up to scrutinization of continuity. 
 Flowery. Verbose. Rambling. Compound sentence upon compound sentence. This book was unreadable for me. I quit 
 The authors treat this topic with the same dense, obtuse, poorly worded approach they used to write the Statics text. If you ever want to use your textbook except to do assigned problems out of it (that is, you want to learn from it by reading it) don't expect it to help you much, if at all 
 It has pretty much all been said, let's just say it again 'cause I'm sure Firaxis/Firefly will plant positive reviews here. The game takes ages to load, the voice acting is silly (British? Australian? Herman's Hermits?), the progression is totally linear (ie the game fails to become more complicated at higher levels), the graphics date to 2002, and the citizen 'fetching' system is completely random and opaque. Sit and watch for awhile: your huts will change size every thirty seconds.   Most importantly, boo Sid, boo. You could've produced this bad Caesar3 ripoff and called it anything, but you called it "CivCity", and even put a tiny Civilopedia in it. Haven't you got enough money? The Civ Series is brilliant. Don't cash it in 
 I bought this without reading the reviews, it was a mistake.  I am designing an addition and need a clear guide from forms to finishing.  This isn't it.  As meantioned, it is a collection of articles.  While informative, there are major gaps in coverage and I am no more ready to design my foundation than before.  There is more useful info on foundations in the framing books I purchased 
 I had great hope for this item after reading reviews, but found that it didn't function as described, and that the three buttons that control it are so close together that my fingers were unable to press them individually...and I have tiny hands.  It's a great idea, but needs a re-design before I could use it. 
 Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.  This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.   And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.        
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 Lousy musicianship here, frankly-- missed notes and poor intonation.  I was hugely disappointed when I heard this album.  Greatly recommend A Festival of Carols in Brass (Philadelphia Brass Ensemble) instead, which is pure joy for the listener 
 This book does not compare with 1) Atlas Shrugged, or 2) The Fountainhead.  In my opinion, those are two of the finest books ever written.  If you haven't read them, put We the Living aside and read them now.  I could not finish We the Living.  I got sick of the stupid relationship.  I guess I got about 1/4th the way through.  Maybe my tastes are changing 
 Easy to install.  We used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates- you can still hear the engine running, but no movement.  Hardly any use at all- maybe 10 times.  We tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you can't open it to see the inner workings. I have never received a bad item from amazon before- I am very disappointed with this product. 
 This is a fairly weak recapitulation of shibboleths found in other texts and utter useless if you want to train teams to be self directed.  The author thinks teams are groups of people in the workplace to achieve goals set for them from "above."  The time for that kind of thinking is long pas 
 Like many people have repeatedly said, Bigger Faster is not a good album. 4 Non-Blondes are the epitome of a one-hit wonder band. Anyone thinking about purchasing this album needs to seriously rethink what they want to do, because the only song they'll want is "What's Up". Even that one song on repeat listens is going to get old after more than one listen. And then it starts to latch onto your brain stem and slowly kill any function your brain was capable of. It's really a dreadful song in retrospect. Linda Perry (doesn't she look like a post-op Perry Farrell?) undulates like a dying cat when she wails "Hey yay yay Yay yay yay Yaerggggghhhhh-- What's going on". It's simply grotesque. I remember that several bands in the early 90's tried their hand at this quasi Folk/Grunge conglomeration, and results were disastrous. Another one of these acts in question was Blind Melon. Sure, everyone (myself included) loved "No Rain", but if you bought the full-length album, you'd wished you hadn't 
 I guess I missed the point. I can see how this film could be considered a horror "classic". I'm sure the violence was ground breaking in 1972... in fact, one of the comments in the "making of" on this dvd was that teenagers were actually throwing up in the theatres. I don't think it's a well done film overall... it's lacking in story, music, direction, and suspense. The acting is not too bad, but could have been more intense and believable in some scenes. If I was craving some good 1970's horror, I'd rather watch "I Spit on Your Grave" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" 
 I read "Gettysburg".  I listened to "Grant Comes East", an unabridged version on tape.  I enjoyed the first.  On a positive note, I got so excited during the Confederate attack on Washington that I almost wrecked my car.  But.  The alternate plot of Gettysburg is feasible but the farther time passes from July 1st, the more difficult it is to accept the authors' projection of alternate history.  The idea of moving the Army of the Tennessee to Pennsylvania and putting them into almost immediate offensive action is asserting a near impossibility.  That Army was virtually inactive, under Grant and Sherman, from July until the battles around Chattanooga in November.  They were as exhausted by victory as Pemberton's men were by defeat.  The rescue of Washington by the 54th Massachussets is a tip of the hat to political correctness.  The authors portray them as battle-hardened veterans.  As of that time (prior to their assault on Ft. Wagner), the unit had no combat experience.  Except for his raid into "the hollow shell" of the Confederacy, Col. Grierson's career had been unremarkable.  It is difficult to believe that his men could have been transported to Pennsylvania, mounted on new, unfamiliar horses, and been a match for Wade Hampton.  I don't plan to read the third book of the trilogy.  My son began reading it and was so turned off that he didn't finish it.  This could have been a great series but I think that Newt (whom I admire as a political strategist) lost his courage about half way through Grant Comes East and stopped pursuing his Confederate victory at Gettysburg to its logical conclusion 
 I thought I had purchased a guide to remote viewing. Instead 80% of the pages are brimming with personal experiences I could care less about, 101 methods on how to quiet the mind and an overview of 10 most spiritual men!  If I had wanted a book on calming my mind I would have purchased something with "YOGA" in the title. If I cared for a biography on Mr. Targ I would have purchased one. And if I was into Hari Crishna I would have time traveled to the 70's!  This book was a waste of time and money. The only "method" the author gives could be explained in a single page, 200 word office memo. "Place a thing in a bag; go into the other room..." -What? That's it? -   The title is totally misleading! 
 I thought these wipes would be a handy solution for the office or situations where I don't want to carry around a bottle and a microfiber cloth.  But contrary to what's promised on the package the wipes left big watermarks on lenses, which ended up dirtier than they started.  The wipes work okay on a computer screen, though 
 I was excited to find this book and enjoyed it as much as the other reviewers seemed to--until several chapters into it the author began making gratuitous, snide political remarks. I ignored the first of them, but they soon became so distracting I put the book aside in disgust. If I had wanted to read political commentary, that's what I would have bought. I would have accepted her broad interpretation of what comprises a "Quirky History" had she not used it as a platform for hurling insults. Her editor, if she had one, should have striken them out. 
 I was raised in Virginia and never understood the details of the Battle of Yorktown. Now I see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together. Immediately after finishing this book I returned to Yorktown with an entirely different understanding. I could relive the battle as if I had been there during the war. It was fascinating! I never learned this from history books.  Male Age 60 
 Let me join the other reviewers in panning this book. The color illustrations are nice (compared to the Adobe manuals, which have gotten thin and have no color), but that's about it. The details just aren't there. For example, the author will show you the star tool, and talk about using its dialog box to set options, but doesn't mention using the Command (PC:ctrl) or Option (PC:alt) keys with this tool, nor what they do. So not only does it read a bit like a manual, but it's an incomplete manual. Beyond that, there's not much content -- try Cohen's "Creative Studio" book or Steuer's "Wow!" book, or better yet, get the video training from Total Training 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 This movie is one of cinema history's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success. "Saturday Night Fever" from a few years before is another example, but that movie could actually stand on its own. Jennifer Beales' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside, I don't think this one could.  I understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80's children, and I will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema. The problem is, the movie's plot is a slow-moving, wasted opportunity.  Physically, Beales is sexy enough to keep your attention, and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made. But her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character. Come to think of it, the acting all around is a bit weak.  But that's not the problem. The movie suffers from two fatal let-downs. The first is the plot itself. Feminism-affirming depictions aside, it's pretty simplistic, unimaginative stuff, even for a dance movie. What's worse is how slow it all moves. The drama sequences in-between dances drag on, straining your patience and sympathy for the character's plights.  The other more tragic flaw, since it is a movie about dance, is the cinematography. While it's certainly not the worst cinematography ever, (check out "the Limey" next time you want a headache.) the dance sequences look like they've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor. We're supposed to be moved by Beales' character's natural talent, but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits. By the time the final dance scene finally comes along, the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out, bad editing. It almost seems the judges let her into Juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute.  Perhaps I'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing. But if it's a movie about dancing, one would think the least they could do is show dancing. Many movies before and after Flashdance managed to get this right ("Saturday Night Fever" certainly did, to its great success), but maybe nobody told this movie's director. It's a shame 
 I read the book because of several people mentioning it. His thoughts may sound correct, but there is much lacking in authority and application. He claims to be a minister for the Lord's church. However, some of the comments he makes leads me to believe the church where he ministers has fallen into apostacy. Some of the things he suggests may have some spiritual backing and some things may look good on paper, but I doubt if the application would work. As an instance, he suggests there is no need for a weekly collection. He suggests that a collection is only necessary when there is a specific need. Couple this with the suggested "house church congregation" and the thought that some elders should be paid for their work, one asks, when it come time to pay the elders, from where will the money come? I only hope those who read this book will continue to look for restoring the church according to the Bible 
 This film gets 2 stars for good production only. Fans of the book will be grossly disappointed. Anthony Hopkins was grossly mis-cast. It stays too far from the book in order to be an "acceptable" movie and too much is lost and twisted in the conversion. Frankly, I'd think McEwan would have enough money that he wouldn't need to sell out this way. The characters have no chemistry with one another. The ending is ambiguous. For all the "movie" magic weaved in, it lacks drama. A mere phantom of the book. Skip it 
 My first viewing of Fahrenheit 451 since its initial release in 1966 was last night via DVD.  Any casual film fan who watches will fall to sleep very fast. Based on the novel by Ray Bradbury, the clever idea of the future sets the stage for an interesting movie. The vehicle that the 451 unit drives is one of the most unusual devices science fiction will ever see.  The plot, the sound and the characters are all completely uninteresting, minus Montag, whom Oskar Werner plays very well.  The moment with the lady with the hidden library was probably one of the silliest examples of what books meant to some. FAHRENHEIT 451 may be considered a classic to some, but without a remake quick, this is a boring artifact to science fiction theater. In the future, the government outlaws books and promotes people to do nothing but watch TV and take drugs. Miserable firefighter Montag, set for a promotion in the 451 book burning unit, takes up the suggestion from a fellow monorail passenger to read a book. His life then goes upside-down from there. Skip the movie and read the book instead 
 I did not see what the big deal was, and would not recommend it. Her language and the way she treated people is offensive, Eurocentric, condescending and narrow-minded -- typical of many travel books of this period. For those trying to learn about Tibet, there is not enough here to satisfy. This is your classic I-am-to-be-admired-because-I-left-the-comforts-of-civilization-applaud-me themed books.  She is not a traveller but a trophy collector 
 I had previously read Poul Anderson's take on Conan ('Conan the Rebel") and found it irritating - Conan is overdone and overblown in the extreme. To my disappointment, I found that the original Conan has every feature to his character that I disliked magnified by a factor of 10!  But, to be honest, what has turned me off with both books is both authors' use of language - it is as if they both sat with a thesaurus and looked for the macho words to substitute for the regular ones. That's okay for some scenes but for every single action Conan takes? The phrase that made me put the book down was when Conan "laughed gustily". I did too, and then I put this book down and picked up anything else 
 I had great results with this product with the first use.  However, when I used it the second time, the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface, leaving me with a smooth, useless triangle.  I replaced the triangle, thinking I had a "dud", but had the same thing happen with the second pad.  The cream will work without the pad, but not as effectively.  If the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface, they will have a winner with this product.  On a positive note, I love the facial product 
 I am in complete agreement with reviewer "zmusicman" in absolutely panning this book.  I found The Sacred Romance to be so poorly written that at many times I could absolutely not understand what the point was at which the authors were clumsily trying to arrive.  Okay, one thing was clear:  God is courting us and trying to get us to enter into a "romantic" relationship with Him, which promises to enter us into the whirlwind adventure of our lifetime.  Hmmm, I have to wonder if the authors were somehow referring to the theological concept of Divine Eros, which has been expounded upon by the Church Fathers and in Orthodox Christian (and perhaps Roman Catholic?) theology.  However, their arguments and illustrations show that even if they have heard of Divine Eros their understanding of it is faulty and extremely shallow, resulting in a self-centered, thirsty for self-esteem sort of "I'm OK, You're OK" relationship with the almighty God.  This is not surprising in light of the fact that this book was written by "evangelical" counselors (not respected theologians) more bent on emotions and warm fuzzies than on the Truth in relation to God's relationship with man, man's fallen nature and sinfulness, the Eros of the Holy Trinity, Christ's Incarnation, etc.  The next big problem that I found lay not in the idea of "romantic" adventures in the Christian life (for if you read the lives of the saints you will find this, as this concept is not new, much to its credit.), but in the so-called messages of the heart and messages of the arrows.  Basically these are the things that either help or hinder our relationship with God.  However, according to Curtis and Eldredge, all of the wonderfully happy and pleasant things occurring in our lives are helpful and all of the not so pleasant, mean, and traumatic things that others have inflicted upon us are arrows from Satan to keep us away from God.  This is, of course, ludicrous and completely unscriptural as the Bible teaches that all things are under God's providence and, although the Devil can harm us, not every unpleasant and uncomfortable occurrence is necessarily from the Evil One or even to his temporary victory.  Many "arrows" are allowed to occur and are even blessed by God for our spiritual growth and health (obviously the cultivation of humility is not a big priority for these guys as it might make someone uncomfortable).  The result: humans remain a bunch of "whiny spiritual babies" who can't take the pain required to gain the Kingdom!  This is obviously dangerous to our souls and I fear that all of the earnest but misinformed readers and workbook filler-outers who buy into this pseudo-psychology (as tempting as it may sound) are placing themselves in spiritual danger.  Finally, I must return to my original critique in once again stating that this book is terribly written.  The authors rarely finish a coherent thought.  Entire chapters are presented without a lucid conclusion.  The quotes from scripture are taken out of context (such as the rambling on Job) and, worst of all, they use literature and film in an attempt to prove their theological assertions as being true.  I am not saying that fiction and the arts cannot contain glimpses of the truth, illustrate a point, or even be biblically based- of course they can.  However, they are not the Canon of Scripture or Church Tradition.  The last time I checked my Bible there was not a Gospel according to Forest Gump or an Epistle to the Last of the Mohicans (of which the authors referred only to the movie, not the novel).  Thus although these films most definitely contain Christian themes they cannot possibly prove theological precepts as being true or false!  On a different note, after reading about 145 pages of nonsense and boo-hoo heartstring tugs disguised as personal accounts on the spiritual life, the authors finally caught my attention with a rudimentary introduction to spiritual warfare.  "Alas", I thought to myself, "They are starting to speak my language!"  My excitement soon waned when two or three short pages later they made an offhanded and clumsy reference to the concept of spiritual "detachment" without even citing it as the drowning of the passions or crediting it to St. John Climacus' Ladder of Divine Ascent and the monastic tradition of the Orthodox Christian Church.  Why would they, after all?  Why not just make the public think that you've reinvented the wheel by making the spiritual life easy, carefree, and painless?  Self-denial, discipline, and obedience just don't sell books.  So Curtis and Eldredge apparently decided to merely borrow the term, clean it up, polish it and paint it, and present it to the unsuspecting masses in a spiritual "get rich quick/miraculous diet pill" sort of way: It might work, but it will most likely destroy you.  Come on Christians, its time to go back to your roots and seek the Truth of Christ.  He may ask you to change your ways, it may sometimes be unpleasant, but the pay off is eternal.        
 This is totally not what I expected. It is nothing but a how to guide for the software and nothing more- No useable info without software.....After reading the write up, I figured I would be able to get something useful, But No...So unless you have the software, don't bother, total waste of money. 
 This book has lots of good advice for those navigating the college years. However, this book is homophobic, and therefore, I must give it a poor rating. Preaching hate is not what I want to find in a Christian book. The book offers bad advice on how to treat homosexuals, and has no advice for homosexuals reading the book 
 I thought this story needed to go through more drafts. The "conflicts" keeping the characters apart were unconvincing -- I kept thinking, "no one would act that way".  This made it hard to sympathize with their plight.  Similarly, the roadblocks in our hero's way -- such as being considered a suspect -- rested on completely irrational behavior by all (not that that's unbelievable for government agents, but still). The ultimate resolution of the "mystery" was a letdown.   The info about the Big Hurrican itself was interesting 
 As someone who has had twenty years of experience both at the executive level within nonprofit organizations and on the boards of others, I found this book disappointing narrow in focus, overly dependent on specialized jargon, and rather uninspiring. When Carver talks about "policy governance" he means his very specialized theory, the Carver theory on board organization. "Step by step guide" means a highly detailed and technical presentation of the Carver system. Essentially this book may be useful as a handbook to those who hire Carver or consultants who follow this particular system. I think this book is being sold to people who will form mistaken impressions based on Carver's reputation. The title "reinventing your board" is misleading in tone because the book is really intended ONLY for people who have "bought into" Carver's highly detailed system and who already have very strong familiarity with his way of thinking. Business books about "reinventing" generally try to inspire, offering a mine of interesting examples, and at their best, teach by "showing."  While there are some very useful and important observations and suggestions embedded in the book, the pedantic style and insistence on numbered, sequential steps made me feel as though I were reading a manual about reinstalling Windows 98 
 I could barely make it through to the middle of this book. The author (Shatz) seems to have dedicated his life to anti-zionism... and, okay, so be it. But as a gentile agnostic, I find the idea of collecting writings of jews who detest Israel to be a ploy, as if just because they are Jewish, they know better than the rest of us that it is right to be anti-israel. Yet Shatz writes for the Nation with arrogant, cynical bitterness about Ajami, an Arab who frequently takes on the Arab establishment! Mr. Shatz, if you, a Jew delight in finding other jews who are anti-zionist, then why does it stun you that an Arab might be against Arab nationalism?  Hail a clue taxi. 
 This movie is almost too easy a target, and I don't want to spend much time on it as the essence of this film has been captured effectively by many, many other reviewers.  At heart, "Date Movie" is just a bit of silliness--it has no ambition, no goals other than to showcase its preposterous spoofs.  Truth be told, I usually don't mind silly escapist fun--as long as a picture knows it's not very good, you can't really hold anything else against it.  My issue with "Date Movie," thus, is more complex.  Movies like "Scary Movie" or "Airplane!" have done a great job skewering other films and pop culture icons--but the primary difference between those films and "Date Movie" is that they frame their spoofs and gags around an actual plot.   My irritation with "Date Movie" comes from its absolute laziness in not even attempting to tell a story.  Heck, it doesn't even fake it.  No, apparently the sheer delight at seeing someone in a fat suit is supposed to carry us through an entire film.  The gags are so random--and don't get me wrong, you might chuckle occasionally--they end up making no sense whatsoever.  Have we gotten so jaded that we don't even expect a rudimentary storyline?  It's sight gag, after sight gag, after sight gag--with a sound gag thrown in for variety.  And it's not even as if these jokes are clever.  By shooting at the easiest pop culture targets and liberally adding unnecessary bodily function humor--it's as if the filmmakers expected us to lap all their "hilarious" antics up.   There are talented people in the cast.  Surely Alyson Hannigan (a star of the small screen) deserves better.  But at least she, and the others, are game and throw themselves into the proceedings--but to little affect.  If I wanted to see sketches and skits with no connection, however, I'd watch SNL or MadTV (which might actually be more entertaining).  "Date Movie" misadvertises itself in the title--there is no movie here!  Normally, like I said, I wouldn't judge an inoffensive bit of nonsense like this so harshly--but this negative review goes out to all the creative screenwriters who couldn't get decent projects greenlit due to this example of filmmaking by committee.

 Will work fine if you only use a few light coats.  Not designed for a family of four in a colder region.  It's now proped up in the corner as it has lost two leggs and half it's hooks.  Now shopping for a new one.  Looked nice in the oak 
 I bought 2 Barbie DVD and this is one of them. It's dark and scary at the beginning and the story line is not that great compare with the other one I have (Mermaidia). It doesn't attract my daughter like Mermaidia and she doesn't like it that much. Don't buy this. Get the Mermaidia one 
 I ask that because the male lead singer of one of the '80's best contributers to the synth-pop genre, Human League, said that on the audio liner notes portion of their "Very Best Of" album. The three  former members of this group left in the early '80's and formed their own  music group, being Heaven 17. I'm sorry to say that, having listened to  this album one night this past week, I find the CD's entire song selection,  in my opinion, to leave a whole lot to be desired. I don't even remember  any of the titles, and I can't understand how any of these purely mediocre  tunes ever could have been a hit in any country. That is essentially it for  me, the reason I didn't give this album only one star is that, thankfully,  it's not the absolute worst I've ever heard. I don't think that my taste in  music could possibly be that bad, I've got taste, decency, dignity,  integrity, and a reputation to uphold after all 
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 Calling this a greatest hits, let alone a Complete Greatest Hits,is a travesty. This pile-up Is woefully lacking in so many ways it's hard to know where to start. I have seen Lightfoot in concert from the late 60's to the early 80's. He always talked about how much he liked to write ballads. You wouldn't know it by listening to this cd. The big hit "If You Could read my Mind", had an equally great song called "sit down young stranger on the flip side. It was Gord's only vietnam era protest song, but you wouldn't know it by hearing it. I could start with where is "steel rail Blues"? but that wouldn't satisfy a casual listener/critic. What is really missing here is the ballad genius of Lightfoot. "Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" was really the last of his great ballad songs, and,unfortunatly the only one he is remembered by. Where is "Ballad of the Yarmouth Castle", "Ode to Big Blue". "The Patriots Dream", "Cherokee Bend", and "Miguel", from the "Summer Side of Life"? I have always thought that Lightfoot, a Canadian, got left behind by the more strongly courted and promoted American folk singers. There are just too many songs on this cd that don't stand up to sooooooooo much of Lightfoot's best live and studio work. There is a double cd of early hits on united artists that is excellent and comprehensive of Gord's early work. If you really want to hear the great songs of Gordon Lightfoot, wait for a more thought out, comprehensive cd or box set. This a pas 
 No George Harrison, but Milli Vanilli and Paula Adbuhl? This just goes to show you what a joke Rolling Stone has become. Looking at the publication date they omitted George Harrison after his death. What insensitivity, compounded by the fact that he was one of the Beatles to which credit is certainly due for helping to exist a culutre that a magazine like Rolling Stone started as a result of, and certainly thrived from.  Rolling Stone has lost most of what little respect I have for them anymore. 
 While this was nowhere near as bad as IMPOSSIBLE, this was just boring and very repetitive.  And the end - the storm - wasn't that in Bittersweet?  A storm on a yacht and the hero comes to claim the heroine??  I have read Danielle Steel for half my life now.....named my daughter after her....but I long for the day when I can say "She's BACK! 
 The Corporate Mystic purports to be a guidebook for leaders of the future, but in reality it morphs the primarily anecdotal experiences of a consulting firm with Zen-like philosophy in a mostly ineffective effort to help the reader become more spiritually connected to his career.  As a member of a volunteer book discussion club for high-potential leaders in the education feild, I am writing this review on behalf of not only myself but a half-dozen other peers who bought this book based on the positive reviews on Amazon.  Unfortunately, the whole of our group has been so grossly disappointed with this read that we have all agreed to abaondon the book halfway through.  And I'm not sure I will ever finish this book independently.  While it is not a downright awful book for leaders, it is fundamentally distorted.  Specifically, an initial claim that the authors have seen more spirituality in corporations than in cathedrals is supported by stories of business leaders and seemingly random Eastern philosophy, all in attempt to define the leader of tomorrow as a "mystic."  While this is a nice catchphrase for a book title to generate sales, it really doesn't seem to work as the actual basis for an entire text.  Though the book is organized logically, if the reader cannot get past the initial claim regarding spirituality (as I and my peers could not), then the reader will be left feeling a bit disjointed throughout the remaining text.  Hendricks and Ludeman do share a few interesting ideas that can be implemented into one's work and life right away--and I'm sure there are more of those in the 2nd half of the book--but even their best insights so far have seemed like an elaboration on common sense or a recycling of someone else's mediocre ideas.  I'm sure this book has built a fan base in the wake of Enron and its siblings in our ethically-challenged era of corporate America.  But I would wager that leaders in even the most ethical companies do not consider their leadership abilities to be rooted in spiritual mysticism.  In summary, the back cover of the book captures a quote from Gary Tooker, CEO of Motorola, in reference to this book.  He calls it "A unique and thought-provoking perspective on management and leadership."  While I agree this book is thought-provoking, and certainly unique, I also notice that the above quote does not overtly support the book, either in accuracy or relevance.  Although you might not completely waste your time by reading The Corporate Mystic, you can do better elsewhere 
 Reading through John Irving's "The Cider House Rules," I found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity. In obtaining a bachelor's degree in English, I had to read a lot of books. Among them were many books that I did not like, but never before had I read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety.   Every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along. People become pregnant, have abortions, and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens. This goes way beyond mere foreshadowing. The book doesn't flow naturally, you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows, playing the puppet master. There are just so many coincidences, so many old friends just happening to run into eachother, so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly, all of the characters vaguely, distantly connected to eachother. I don't want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the Eames (rhymes with screams) family is just too much coincidence to bear. It's as though the author is God, and the characters completely lack free will.  And then there's the "protagonist," Homer Wells. I put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story, Homer Wells barely does anything in the story. He barely even speaks during the story. He is virtually a non-character, devoid of personality or will, around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve. The scenes that do not involve Homer Wells at all, and they make up the majority of the book, are without fail the most interesting scenes. I think that the real protagonist of the book is Dr. Larch, but even Melony seems more real than Homer does.   The story is very long and rambling. Subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on. Minor characters keep popping into the story, then disappearing, only to pop back into the story exactly when they're needed. Conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten (like the situation with Debra Pettigrew).   After such a rambling, at times rather boring plot, the ending feels rather rushed. It is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything, tie up every loose end, in the last 25 pages (and tying up loose ends, in this case, means a lot of people conveniently dying). To spoil the plot just a little, Homer Wells, who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul, suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion. I personally am pro-choice as well, but I found that Homer's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters 
 Some of the Reacher novels--such as The Killing Floor--have been incredibly good, but I was genuinely disappointed in this one.  The author describes Reacher as heroic, a loner, etc., but instead he should write in such a way that we reach these insights without being told.  Phrases, such as "back in the day," get repeated much too often.  Reacher has become a caricature of himself 
 Based on the title, I expected this to be an account of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.  There is certainly some of that.  But it's really a book about the author/war correspondent.  The book reiterates countless times how the author was the first American into Nagasaki after the bomb.  That's impressive (although later in the book we read about someone who got to Hiroshima earlier)-- but the book doesn't contain much substance about Nagasaki.  The rest of the book is a mish-mash of other aspects of the war, and it gets repetitive about how merciless the Japanese were to our prisoners.  Toward the end the book tries to become political and focus on censorship, which wasn't very interesting 
 This music bridge is obviously a product that should not be in the market.  I spent at least 10 hours in three different chat and phone sessions with technical support until they asked me to return the unit (got a used unit in exchange).  After upgrading firmware in the router and downloading the utility from their web site to replace the one in the CD, and three more sessions with the tech people, my PC can finally ping the bridge, and every now and then the utility can even find it.  No way to play music through the bridge though.  Tried changing WMP speaker settings, turning firewall off, uninstalling and installing the utility, everything I (or tech support) can think of.  Also, when the bridge is powered my network becomes unstable and the PC's connectivity goes on and off. I have Linksys router and phone adapter, but if I had done a google search before buying, I would surely had gone for a different product, such is the number of negative comments I've found afterwards 
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 This case actually scratches and destroys your pearl. The inside is very rough and uneven; pieces of leather are sewn together in a cheap way that destroys your phone. The phone doesn't provide any protection on top. I really regret buying this ... my phone is all scratched. Get a soft case that stays on permanently. Pass this one up 
 As a recent Econ Major from the University of Washington, I found the book outdated and inconsistent.  It had the nauseating sense of a political polemic dressed up as an "economic treatise."  I can only agree with a handful of his "realist" conclusions.    While reading Eat the Rich, I found the first few chapters on theory semi-humorous and the rest of the book dry, just like most economics texts.  Apparently the dismal science is humorless by definition.    As for Mr. O'Rourke's so called libertarian credentials, I would like to revoke them after reading this book and his romance pamphlet for the U.S. military (called Peace Kills).  Just because you are a member of the Cato institute, doesn't mean you are a consistent libertarian.  In fact, it probably makes you an inconsistent one.    Obviously I have more complaints, so I will save us both time and just relate one more.  Why would you seriously treat Albania as a capitalist country?  Then call it anarchist?  It seems that P.J. has a bit of an axe to grind here.  If he would have just looked at the Fraser institute's study on economic freedom - he would find Albania ranks number 91st in government regulation of business, 74th on protection of private property and 69th on the relative (taxed) size of government out of roughly a 100 countries.  Obviously Mr. O'Rourke hasn't done his research very well (or his empiricist radar was turned off) if I was able to do a similar analysis in a few moments without going to the country in question.  How can the 69th largest government be called "anarchist?"  I am truly puzzled.  (After looking at some of the recent historical data - I wonder if O'Rourke was asleep while writing this chapter.  I have been generous with my numbers for the former Communist country.)   All seriousness aside, I liked P.J.'s earlier stuff better, most notably "Parliament of Whores".   He is much funnier and seems to be more at home with politics.  Yet, from what I have seen, he is writing another book about economics - God spare us.  If you are truly interested in learning Economics - try Gene Callahan's "Economics for Real People." 
 I own this product but on choosing a waffle maker for my daughter, I did not consider purchasing another one.  I have had it a year, using it about once a month.  It sticks and the light doesn't always work. It does make waffles but I will be purchasing a different one in the near furture. 
 What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about 
 Even with the promise of Chevy Chase dying in the first reel, this film is so dumb and bad. It's easy to think that Benji typed this film all by himself. Except he would have eliminated Chevy's voiceover. I was so expecting to enjoy this film as a cheesy cinema classic, but it was too painful to be fun. Chevy Chase films like vinegar remains bitter no matter how old it gets 
 Dreck conjured from the dimwitted semi-erotic fantasies of a chinless anemic Englishman resting on laurels from 20 years past. Borderline child porn with delusions of grandeur and pretensions of meaningfulness 
 My husband and I did not bother finishing this book. We skipped around to different chapters, as the editors suggest, in hopes of finding something erotic. The editors clearly had lofty aspirations for this book, but their  intentions fell short of what they managed to achieve. Unfortunately, most  of the stories were poorly written and laughably ridiculous; a bad  combination. You can get mediocre erotica on the 'net for free. Don't waste  your money 
 In two minutes it flucuated over 5 pounds.  Don't waste your money.  The 11$ Sunbeam dial scale is more accurate 
 I read One Step Closer first and found it a great book.  Easy to read with a lot of insightful commentary.  Then I read this book and just did not like it at all.  It reads like a college term paper and is nothing but quotes from other authors.  I just don't see how that qualifies as a "new book" 
 This was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author's task management system.  This was the beginning of the "scientific management" line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book.  The essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time.  He also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success.  Still, a reader shouldn't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources.  The book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers 
 Twenty-something Bette lives in Manhattan, has a close knit group of friends, enjoys romance novels, and apparently possesses little fashion sense or celebrity IQ. Everyone Worth Knowing is the story of how she becomes an accidental success in the surreal world of celebrity public relations, and finds romance--real and fictional--along the way.   Maybe it's just me, but Bette seems to have problems many people would love to "suffer" through. Although told a lot of things about her, I never got the feeling I could really picture Bette or understand what she wanted, even in the end. Her story feels underdeveloped and many of the events predictable or random. Still, if you liked The Devil Wears Prada and enjoy modern formulaic romances, you will probably enjoy Everyone Worth Knowing 
 i read DYING FOR CHOCOLATE and THE CEREAL MURDERS, both of which i found barely passable, but i wanted to continue in the series anyway. This book was a big disappointment. the mystery barely progresses at all, and suddenly you're hit in the face with the killer. there is way too much focus on the church. i'm not a religious person and i was seriously lost in this book, skimming and even skipping several chapters. i just wanted to know, whodunnit?? but even the solution was unsatisfying, complicated, and left me feeling cheated out of both money and time 
 There is no royal road to Hegel. This book was written by a political scientist, not a philosopher--and it shows. A reviewer above said that one who wants to avoid Hegel's technical terminology should read this book. Patten not only avoids Hegel's technical terminology, he shows no signs of understanding it. There is no substitute for reading Hegel himself. But if you _must_ read Hegel through a secondary source, get Peperzak's Modern Freedom. Save up because it's expensive 
 In the end I was disappointed.  Throughout the book two separate stories take place. One is a record of Bob Dubois, whose life is ruled by circumstances and bad life management skills. The other tells of Vanise Dorsinville, a young Haitian woman, who struggles to survive as she makes her way to America. Neither is a pretty story, and when the two characters finally meet it gets even worse. When I finished reading this book I was angry at myself for muddling through all the italicized Haitian accent dialogue and French Creole voodoo terminology.  Yah mon, true 
 This book was required for a course I took called "Postmodernism". While I do not dispute the intelligence of these authors, I do question their communicability and the success of their "arguments". The task they take on is to destroy the Hegelian dialectic. Do they succeed? If you were to remove their self-absorbed semantics which riddle the text with unexplained vocabulary, sans apology, you would find there is not much really there. My proof is that a respected and intelligent professor could not interpret, rework and teach the same material much less communicate it. It is an exercise in ambiguity 
 It's a real bold move placing the start and end date on the cover. I figure he's got about 9 more months of sales before this book will go into the pile of outlandish titles along with "DOW 36,000" or "DOW 100,000"  I read the book after hearing the podcast on Jim Puplava's Financial Sense online site.  Mr. Brussee relies heavily on Treasury Inflation-protected Securities as the best place to put your money during this "depression."  The main problem with that assumption is: How can you rely on getting accurately indexed inflation protection from the same agency that's responsible for reporting the inflation numbers? In a word, can't.  Since the measure of inflation (as measured by CPI) was changed several years ago with hedonic adjustments, anyone investing in TIPS is placing a lot of faith in the government to be honest on two conflicting fronts: undereporting inflation to keep the growth of entitlements down while accurately reflecting the growth of inflation on the TIPS bonds.  Not gonna happen!  As for the author's claim that the housing market rolling over is going to kick-start the next depression, and that it will start in 2007, I can hardly wait to see this play out, either for or against the author's claim.  Unfortunately, as I alluded to in my opening of this review, the book is more likely to land in the pile of outlandish claims than to provide you with accurate "what to do in case..."  A better plan for a depression, if you indeed buy the author's claim that one starts next year, would be to read Robert Prechter's book, Conquer the Crash. His book is filled with several practical resources on how to survive and prosper if a depression actually hits, and it's a lot better advice than to rely on the one-trick-pony of TIPS to protect your wealth.  Pass on this book 
 As a lecturer of e-commerce, I was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the Internet.  However, I am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored.  The author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the Internet has brought about.  The result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic.  I have nothing good to say about this book - money wasted 
 As another reviewer said in his 1-star review of this book, the sections on poker are excellent but they are buried inside of seemingly endless chapters on Ted Binion's murder, the author's grandparents, and all kinds of other nonsense.  While those subjects could possibly be fascinating, McManus isn't nearly good enough as a writer to make them interesting.  So what we're left with is a highly-compelling description of the 2000 WSOP for about 1/3rd of the book and then 2/3rds garbage.    Best avoided if you're looking for a poker book 
 After reading all the other rave reviews, I thought I had found the dream machine!...but...alas my old Krups, though slightly on the down side of it's brewing and steaming life, does a much...I mean, MUCH better job of giving me a strong tasty latte every morning.  I may just order another Krups at a seventh of this price, and be glad I had it to return to.  Soooo, my recommendation is to not buy this machine if you like a really rich espresso, and a really foamy, hot latte.  
 I read this book because I was desperately in need of something to entertain me for a rather long flight, and it was the only thing I could find on a shelf at a train station other than a few romances that I wouldn't come near with a ten-foot pole.  Anyway. On to the review -  It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.  That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight. It was a tolerable read for the most part.  Baldacci's a decent storyteller, but a sucky writer 
 As with other books edited or affiliated with Jean Smith, there seems to be confusion as to how many days there are in the year.  This book says there's 365, while another of Smith's collections about Buddhism says there's 366.  In fact, both books only have 356 entries.  This type of glaringly obvious mistake is representative of the lack of depth and detailed consideration given to the content of this book.  I would look elsewhere for "wisdom" if I were you.  I wasted another fifteen bucks on this one 
 Not playful, not energetic, nor creative , unlike what they've done before. Looks like something they quickly threw together to make a fast buck. I love this band, however, only when they're at their best...and this is completely the opposite!  Ced Gee is horrible on the mic and makes Lil Wayne look like a genius. Buy a Kool Keith solo album instead!  They definitely wasted the opportunity to show the new hiphop fans why they've earned "legend" status 
 After a brief email correspondence with Bryant, it's easy to see why this was such a boring, poorly written book. I'm glad I was given the book and didn't actually waste any money on it. The book jumps from one newspaper article to another, and never really tells me, an avid baseball fan anything I didn't already suspect about players taking steroids and other performance enhancers. I mean really, it's been going on for ages in all sports. Bryant's obsessive fascination with race and racism really comes through when he spends an entire chapter on Barry and Bobby Bonds and race relations between writers and players. His never really backs up any of his racial assertions with any more then anecdotes and opinions. He blames Bobby's alcoholism on the way he was treated by the baseball world and blames Barry's problems on everyone but Barry. He claims that white writers make life troublesome for difficult black players but treat difficult white players with kit gloves. Tell that one to Steve Carlton, Howard. Please do yourself a favor and don't waste even five bucks on a used copy of this. Your time would be wasted to even get a copy from the library. Mine went in my recycle bin 
 the whole movie is all 'bout a girl who got assaulted by that witch who swore 2 get her revenge on the girl's father so spirits started slappin' the girl 'n' kickin' her back 'n' forth 'n' pullin' her 'n' pushin' her i feel that was the whole movie all 'bout i was waitin' 4 some other scenes cuz what the spirits did 2 the girl wasn't scary at allllllllll......think 'bout it twice or more be4 buyin' it................ 
 This is exactly what I DONT like about KMFDM's new sound--I sure hope this is not the singer from MDFMK, because I liked that singer, but this chick sounds like that newer vocalist from Pigface--boo--thumbs down! 
 When will conservatives start trying to use facts, reason, and common sense?  Instead we get vitrol once more, sometimes disguised as reasonableness.  Anyone who tries to paint with the same brush the liberal embrace, temporary as it was, of Russia in the 20th century, and support for the UN in our current day and time is once again using misdirection, reading events in current history through the glasses of ideology...actually sounds a bit like those who chose communist thought while ignoring how it plays out in the real world when the theory is filtered through flawed humans.  We get the transformation of our democracy into a place where patent ideological claims ride rough shod over the plain facts in front of us.  
 I'm a postdoctoral level biomedical researcher who has used many other biostatistics books before. This book is currently used for entry-level biostatistics at my School of Public Health. The bonus is that this book is geared towards epidemiology (eg, there is a chapter on rates and standardization), and I liked the CDROM that comes with the book and contains datasets.   Unfortunately, the authors have chosen to derive many key concepts from probability theory. This is fine if you are comfortable with probability concepts. However, most students with background in social sciences are not: thus I found that this approach often adds an unnecessary level of complexity.   Most of the examples are long-winded, dragging on from page to page - flipping back and forth is extremely frustrating, and the layout makes it difficult to grasp what the point of each example is. Also, the long-winded style makes this book a poor desk reference if you just quickly need to check a formula or definition. Sadly I have to say that I very rarely use this $100 book - there are plenty of more accessible and succinct entry-level texts that cost a fraction of this volume. And yes, Google is better learning tool than this book 
   I read through the book in about an hour.  Outside of the helpful exercises (which earned an extra start) I found it too be too much for anyone that's employed and doesn't have exclusive access to weights.  If you're not at least 6 months into working out this book will be too much to read.  
 It tells about conventional stretching (but claims to be different) only which one can find for free in many websites. A big waste of money. Moreover, it gives non tracable references.  For stretching I would suggest-- "Stretching" by Bob Anderson for beginners and then  "Stretching scientifically" by Thomas Kur 
 I was very disappointed with this rain suit. I bought it, especially after seeing the above review, since I too bicycle to commute. I'm not sure if they sent me a different rain suit or what, but the one I got didn't have the overall pants. I bike an hour each way and, after the first ride, the pants have holes around the bicycle seat area and the material is breaking down at other points in the pants as well. The jacket immediately started coming away from the bottom snap. (Definitely not a "rugged" suit!) I didn't have a problem with being too hot, although perhaps that is because this is springtime in New England. I wouldn't bother buying this suit unless your commute is quite short. 
 I hate to say this, but Child ripped the main structure of the plot, as well as the precise ending, from, of all things, an episode of KNIGHT RIDER titled 'Dangerous Maneuvers' from the fall of 1982. Everything is there: the army brats bonded together by accident,the love interest being not entirely white, the MPs dealing in crooked merchandise,one of the MPs being the father of one of the two main characters...but the weirdest part is the climax...I was sitting there in a state of shock, gasping at the tv,since right in front of me was the ending of The Enemy. Maybe it isn't exactly identical, but it's so close it's really strange...You won't believe it at first. I didn't. This was just yesterday too! The Sleuth network... Then I remembered that Child worked in TV for many years.  By the way, except for the baby face and easy smile, Hasselhoff would make a credible Reacher, he's about the right size. Too young, of course.  Anyway, it was very creepy.  It could be coincidence, but I doubt it. The climax is almost an identical scene. Yet I don't think it would be legally plagiarism, since there are dissimilarities as well. Interesting to think about. 
 I purchased this book as a requirement for a course I was taking. Although the title did appeal to me, since it is a topic that I have a high interest in, I was pretty much disappointed after having read through it. It was hard to read and understand, I had to reread through many of the chapters. I think the topic was great, I just don't feel the authors did justice to the topic 
 they said the cd was new. that it was still in its shrink wrap and everything. instead, they sent me an old, delaphadated and used cd.  it had many scratches on it, and one of the tracks wouldnt even play 
 After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.    Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead.   What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  And what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!   Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.   After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in Him or anything for that matter!   This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.   We never get closure on Lyra's parents. We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from. We never see Will reunited with his mother. We get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how. Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it. The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing. The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of disovles. Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.  Another reader pointed out: " Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly."   It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd. This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life. 
 Roger Ebert is a great movie reviewer and he is the most famous film critics in The United States, but this book will be an unnecessary waste of money.  To find all these reviews, a film lover just has to go to Ebert's website on the Internet.  There, the reader will find all these reviews and many more!   
 Ordered all 3 Alton Brown books.  The cooking and baking books are loaded with info for curious cooks and bakers.  The kitchen manual you could do without and your money could be better spent buying a good 3 ring binder and some good paper for making notes and writing down recipes 
 I read this book in my local libary and found it very interesting. It also applies to government which have become infected with consultants and "reform" fads. Another good book was "The Witch Doctors,  making sense of management gurus. WE already survived TQM, and now are  going throug"reinvention" which was supposed to be all done in 3  to 5 years. Now 7 1/2 years later it takes 2x the number of people to do  half the work in twice the time. This is is causing burnout in a lot of  people. I'll buy the book when it comes out in paperback 
 I read the works of folks like Vince Flynn, Lee Child, and, I thought, Nelson DeMille, for the escape--the action--intrigue. Someting to make the plane flight go faster.  I don't read for thinly-veiled, current-events, quasi-political commentary.  (There are recognized exports available for that sort of thing.  For example, a tour-of-duty in Vietnam gives neither me, nor Nelson, "expert" status on the conduct of warfare.)  DeMille, as he matures as a person and a writer, has taken to slipping his "agenda" into his storytelling.  Consequently, the "story telling" aspect of his craft has, in my opinion, atrophied.  He, of course, has that right. But I, for one, am done reading his books. There's always the news if I want current events commentary. And better suspense writers if I desire an entertaining escape.     
 Heavy, Short Battery Life, Rechargeable Batteries last a couple of months then need replacing. I do not recommend this product 
 It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that, it's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy, predictable, low-budget horror movies from the early nineties. The FX are funny at first, but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy. The acting is uniformly terrible, and one has to image that the typically enjoyable Barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her 
 Limp movie by today's standards, with jarring switches from locations in NY to obvious Universal studios backlot. Very TV movie in its look and overuse of extreme closeups.  A view of the 60's counterculture that didn't even ring true then.  I also seem to recall that when I saw this in the 60's that Susan Clark points out the actual Coogan's Bluff (a real natural landmark in NY) to Eastwood's character during their scene above the Cloisters.  She tells a little story about it, tying it to the character's "bluff" about how tough he is.  If I am recalling correctly, that scene has been clumsily trimmed out on this DVD.  Note how in one shot Eastwood is wearing his hat, but in the very next one it is off.  At that point the dialogue appears to jump from one subject to an entirely different one.  Without this scene the title doesn't even make sense anymor 
 I read this book on the advice of a friend who said it was an american literary masterpiece.  To my surprise I found the book boring and devoid of any value.  Miller spews out a self-absorbed diatribe intermingled with profane and tedious nonsense.    After a while I thought - why am I wasting precious time on this book?   There are other far better literary works.   
 Not much to say about this item it sucks. very thin and cheap made. Does not seal at all and does not keep the bread freah This is the worst product i have every got from Amazon. 
 This book is fine for someone who is already organized, knows where everything is, and just wants a more streamlined approach to schedules and time management.  I may use some tips for organizing closets, etc, but  there was very little useful information to help me get motivated. Just  reading the book lets you know that Emilie Barnes is born organized 
 The intro is tight, the rest just sucks... End of review! 
 The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution 
 This was  thrilling book. I laughed, i cried and when I got frustrated with the book I sometimes wanted to close the book and never open it again. What really made me cry was in this book Amy looses her best horse to cancer and scince she was a little child she new him. I recommend this book to anyone who is an animla freak like me and i absolutely can't wait to read the rest of the series of Heartland books. 
 My husband and I tried using this book and it's methods for almost a year with not even a hint at conception. The author's "frank" opinion about trying to conceive after 35 is negative and discouraging. I refused to believe that I was infertile but because I am over 35, it was very difficult to determine my fertile window using these methods. It caused undo stress and anxiety and my husband and I finally broke down and spent the money to purchase an OVwatch. We conceived the first time using the watch. I am not trying to plug them for any reason other than it works. We conceived twice using the watch after a year of frustration and depression. They are the most decent, supportive, positive customer service oriented company I have ever encountered. I found Terri Weshcler to be incredibly negative and judgemental of women trying to conceive at a later age-and the last thing you need is another seed of negativity when you're trying to conceive 
 This book is not worth your money; I wish I hadn't paid full price. I was expecting some fun, some chills, some scares and it really only gave me goosebumps thinking of the fact that I paid for this when I could have gotten something better to read for the price I paid.   Don't get me wrong it had some scary moments but was overall it was a flop. Much of it was boring - especially the flashbacks which went on for chapters. The ending felt forced and rushed.   And oh man did the women in the book run around naked a lot. C'mon even when you are being pursued by a madman you cover up! I don't want to speak ill of the dead (I read that Richard Laymon has died) but this just seemed like a weird fantasy playing out for him - all the naked and lesbian-suggestive moments.    Save your money. 
 To keep it real, I bought this album and returned it the same day.  Warren G is at his best when puts out mellow, laid back beats and laces them with simple, but catchy rhymes.  This album is full of bouncy beats, and the flows don't really ride the beats well.  I though reuniting with mista grimm would be a good idea, but it wasn't used right, and George Clinton doesn't belong here.  This album was made for a particular west coast type of fan, and not really intended for hip hop fans in general.  warrens best was his first, and take a look over your shoulder was tight too, I still don't know why people hated on his second album.  That album was tight.  His third, I want it all, was okay, but you could notice a bit of a decline, and this one just dropped his status.  His next album, the g files:code 213 should get him back on track though, as I heard he is taking it back to his roots.  That should drop sometime this summer, 2003 
 I value the Amazon Product Reviews and have purchased many items based on customer feedback.  I purchased this phone from Home Depot for $69.95.  I am returning it today.  It is to large for comfort, the reception is bad, the letters too small for those of us who need reading glasses... I could go on 
 Not at all what I hoped for, this book does not do much for you, if you're planing on useing it to help you manage your low carb diet you'll find that this book is kind of crippled it does what the title implies, but it does JUST that, it would make a BIG difference if it stated if the number of carbs it lists include fiber content or better yet, if it listed both carbs and fiber 
 I had been recommended to read Anne Perry, and told by someone that the first book was one of the best, and was very disappointed by what I discovered.  It's one of those books with much "telling" of what characters are feeling and how they are developing rather than "showing" those feelings and developments.  It is written in an anachronistic style, doesn't have the true ring of the Victorian era at all.  (I am comparing to books written in that era - Dickens, Thackeray, Conan Doyle).    The author also does one of my least favourite things, which is to forget key information.  (spoiler alert)  Inspector Pitt is the one who tells the family the name of Edward's mistress, and they later spend much time and effort trying to hide that fact from him.  How amateur.  After reading other glowing reviews of the book - "it all seems immediate and alive", her excellent knowledge of upperclass Victorian England life, "excellent characterisation" - I am left wondering whether maybe I read a different book from everyone else.  Perhaps the later books in the series will improve. 
 I never quit reading books. I could see how this story would be confusing and hard to understand. I was able to keep up with the reading and understand it, but it was just plain boring. This book I just wasn't into. I didn't look foward to reading it. So I didn't finish it. Morrison jumped around to much.. once I started getting familiar with characters, she would switch it up. I don't know how it ever ended, but I wasn't patient with the book to find out 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 This book is a must read for everyone caught up in busyness.  It starts slow and the early chapters might turn off those with deep beliefs in striving to achieve - but read on.  Everyone must set priorities that are realistic and in accord with one's gifts.  Those priorities must (absolutely must) include family, spouse, and spiritual concerns.  Chapters 9 and 10 are where the rubber hit the road for me, and I am using hindsight to make that judgment. Sixty to Eighty hour work weeks don't cut it and put me out of touch with God and family 
 Before I even had the opportunity to use this product, it has disappointed me.  I have washed this item per the manufacturer's instructions.  The bottom pad came out of the drier all pilled.  I wonder how many more washings this pad can stand.  Truly a disappointment 
 We enjoyed the early parts of the film because of the humor, but my friend, a survivor of Auschwitz Birkenau and a forced labor camp, was finally outraged by this treatment of the Holocaust, as was I. A child in Auschwitz would have been gassed to death immediately so there would be no chance to make a game of the camp experience! My friend would have been gassed to death, because he later found out they gassed all kids under the age of 18 soon after he left for a labor camp. Watch Divided We Fall instead! Or for a very good depiction of life in the camps, watch Fateless or The Grey Zone 
 However it doesn't work as well as my previous one from Pavoni. The cover on the Capresso fits around the outside of the grinder so when you transfer the ground coffee to another container there is always some cleanup required. It also takes longer to get the beans finely ground. 
 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 This book is put together by an author with credibility. However, he picked and chose excerpts of certain tapes to suit his purpose. I do believe, however, these tapes actually debunk many of the myths put forward by Nixon-haters 
 When this book starts with the supposition that these are some of the things that the United States should do, it negates the fact that the United States has done a significant number of those things and does not distinguish between the things it is doing and should be doing.   Additionally while contributing a solution to the war on terror in Iraq, the group failed to outline the specifics of strategy necessary and used ambiguous terms that could mean many things to many different people.  What I found most troubling about the report though was the arrogance of these folks. While this is well intended, the United States is a sovereign state and we are assisting our new friends in Iraq who are also a sovereign state. Iraq is not a providence of the United States and that relationship, however unique in the world right now, does not make Iraq the 51st State or an extension of US foreign policy. There are channels that even our state department officials and their diplomatic corps must work through. There are intelligence channels in the largest CIA office in the Arab world being worked. The US military in Iraq is working in a unified chain of command with the Iraqi's to secure their borders and Baghdad.   The problem however, is not adequately addressed through this report and that is the brain-drain in Iraq that has occurred from 30+ years of tyranny and war. This is the core issue that fuels the sectarian fight and smart people can help Iraq rebuild its basic services and infrastructure that has been destroyed by more than the United States presence and the war there.   There is another problem with Iraq that the report does not even attempt to touch. Where is the rest of the world? After all these, are State Department Heavy weights? How about Saudi Arabia and Kuwait restructuring and forgiving significant amounts of war reparations from Saddam Hussein still owed by the Iraqi people and government. It is 2007, let us move on, and forgive. How about the mighty European nations who currently aren't part of the coalition of the willing? They have seen what two world wars can do to their home lands. They know the death and destruction and have lost their taste for war. How about some significant contributions in humanitarian assistance instead of the people in the crowd pointing fingers and attempting to look "too cool" to get their feet sandy and roll up those sleeves and get some humanitarian aid in there and how about some oversight so the oil-for-food thing doesn't repeat itself.   Let us get the EU to shift their oil purchasing power away from the tyranny in Iran and encourage growth in the Iraqi government by buying Iraqi whose government is doing its dandiest to be more pro western than any other Muslim government in the world with the exception of Turkey.  How come these ideas weren't on the table?  How about the use of American forces specifically in changing the rules of engagement in the country. If Americans are fired on, we are going to kill you period. If you hide in a mosque, we will hunt you down and kill you. If you use your religion and innocents to further your political aims, we will kill you.   How about pressuring the Russians to assist in Iraq rebuilding by forgiving the Iraqi debt and to stop selling terrorist guns.  Let us really get serious about the problems. They had many good starts in this book but it definitely didn't do enough...and talking with the Iranians hasn't done the EU and Japanese any good...a liar is still a liar and after all they've stated they want to blow us up...are there reasonable people in the government or have they all been exiled, jailed or killed as was the case in a totalitarian régime like Iraq? Just something to consider. 
 What a joke. Liberals are wonderful people, really. Ha, NOT! They can't argue good politics so they attack someone who can. Nice..what looser 
 I ordered this bike for my granddaughters 4th birthday.  The first shipment arrived on schedule, but the box was total destroyed and without opening you could see that the bike was scratched and dented.  Delivery was refused and another bike was sent.  The 2nd bike arrived, with the box being in less than perfect condition, but delivery was accepted.  When my son started assembling the bike, he found that several of the parts had been assembled at the factory incorrectly and he could not assemble the bike.  The bike was returned for a credit and we went and purchased a similar bike locally.  We still have not received a credit for the return of the bike.  I am very disappointed and will not purchase from this vendor again 
 Well I purchased this bike because I previously had a Schwinn recumbent bike that I was pretty happy with but had to sell it because I moved. I'm very disappointed with this upright bike though. I think the seat is very very uncomfortable, so uncomfortable that I don't want to use the product. The seat design in itself it horrible. The way it bolts on is a little strange, and it appears all the Schwinn upright models are like this. Even though I have the seat bolted down all the way, it still wiggles. As others have mentioned, my box came trashed all ripped and with holes in it. In fact, the UPS driver actually told me that I might want to refuse the product, but I took it anyways. I think I'm going to attempt to return this if possible. Although the entire process is a huge hassle since I work everyday, the box is trashed, and how heavy the product is. I also had to help the UPS driver carry it up to my 3rd floor apt. I don't recommend any Schwinn upright bikes, although I likes their recumbent series. I hope Amazon will help me come up with a solution to return this 
 Is it just me, or does this CD sound horrible in comparison to the release on actual audio tape? It sounds very tinny on CD. Furthermore, they removed the most interesting, hilarious track, the one where Danzig improvs his "Bobby Steele's an a-hole" lyrics during Teenagers from Mars. That was half the reason I bought this, and was very annoyed to find it missing. 
 Is there substance?  Yes, not a lot, but there is a brief overview of history here.    Is there fluff?  Oh hell yes and way too much of it.  There are just way too many asides and way too much focus on kings rather than conditions.  For example, he explains that Caesar may have had a homosexual escapade in Spain.  NOT PERTINENT and a little offensive to boot.  Remove such things and you have about 50 pages of worthy reading and I have to question some of his findings in those 50.    He goes to great lengths to brush over Spanish atrocities in the New World and at Home, claiming they are basically English racism towards the Spanish designed as a PR campaign against.  I have no doubt that such existed as the two countries have long had problems, but that doesn't mean the Spanish Conquistadors weren't brutal (and downright evil at times).  And the Inquisition should never have detractors.  The most telling moment of the book happens, after detailing this "racism", he then goes on another aside to tell how the Irish sold out the Spanish for a bottle of whisky. Holy crap is that the pot calling the kettle black and how any editor would let that slip through, calls into question the entire book.  So I learned a little from it, but it's not worth your effort.  Seek other books.  
 Jerry Jenkins ought to be ashamed. He states in an interview on this DVD that he started a movie company because he thought this was such a good story that it needed to be told. First and foremost it's a terrible movie, Christian or secular it's just plain bad. The script stinks, the characters are unlikable and weak, the directing and editing is high school quality and most of the acting is pathetic. As for it being a "Christian" movie you've got to be kidding me. Why? Because there's no cussing? Is that what makes it Christian? The gospel is not portrayed in any way, shape or form. In fact the way I see it it's unbiblical. We even have the main character who doesn't really profess to be a Christian but since she mentions god we assume that she must be (in fact Jesus is never mentioned in the movie) she ends up dating an openly unbelieving boy. Is that the "Christian" message we want to send our kids? From now on if Jerry Jerkin's name is on a movie I'm not watching it. This movie robbed two hours of my life I'll never get back. If you want to see a family movie buy a classic made in the 30's or 40's.    
 I ordered this product for more than what its new price is on December 21, 2006 as a Christmas present for my mother. It didn't arrive until January 9th, and it arrived damaged!  We sent it back for a refund.  On February 2nd, this low-rate item arrived at our doorstep again, AFTER I checked several times by phone to make sure that my order was marked as a RETURN and not an EXCHANGE.  We decided to set it up and see if this one was better.  STILL DAMAGED in another area. I have called The Sharper Image over ten times now over a span of 2 months. I know their customer service number by heart, and I even know their direct customer service number (without having to go through the machine) by heart (call 1-888-344-5555 instead of 1-800...). Their shipment is slow and their processing is painfully slow! They've given me 3 different order numbers without telling me, so I couldn't get accurate information about my order online.  Beware of dealing with this company.  If you can, go into a Sharper Image store somewhere, take the thing out of its box to examine it, and only then consider bringing this product into your house.  One good thing is that they do give you a full refund, tax included.  At least that's what they told me by phone today.  By the way, this should be called a Foldaway Strider, not Elliptical.  It absolutely does not have the elliptical wheel or power that other more functional elliptical machines do 
 This is a big dissapointment from GC.  This whole album is pretty much a fake cry for help, trying to make GC fans think that they're miserable.  "I Just Want to Live", "Predictable", and "Believe" are the cheesiest songs I've ever heard.  They should have applied themselves instead of having false breakdowns saying, "Oh, God, feel sorry for me!"  GET REAL! 
 There's nothing new in this book that haven't already been said. I was fairly disappointed, as I was hoping for a book that explained to the point what people want to spend money on, and how to technically go about to get those images. Instead, I get "advice" that is nothing more than common sense.  In my opinion, you can skip this book entirely 
 If you like reality TV or soap operas, this DVD is right up your alley. Jamie is indeed informative and amusing during his cooking shows. I guess I expected something like that from this DVD 
 Let's not open up a can of worms by focusing on the virtue of the various "renderings" of the Ellen Coolidge statement.  If we do this, as other reviewers have done, then we are forced to refer back to the original statement and reexamine its apparent accuracy or logic.  When we are ultimately forced to do so then it is easy to determine that  Ellen Collidge's statement tends to add validity to one main idea that the authors of the American Myth book tend to want to undermine which is  that a female chambermaid did exist for Jefferson's chamber.  Theoretically, this could have been any of the Hemingses women including Sally.  A further attempt at an "intelligent" analysis will also reveal the "incorrectness" of the Ellen Cooldige's statement when she implies that knowone could have emerged from Jefferson's chamber without anyone noticing or as Coolidge tends to say, without being exposed to public gaze.   Anyone who has read any history on Jefferson and Monticello will realize that the porticles built in the early 1800's and adjacent to Jefferson's chamber (and so obviously "architecturally incorrect" as if done so out of a desperate need for privacy) alowed for easy concealment  of entries or exits into his chamber.  So regardless of the intent of modern day individuals such as Annette Gordon Reed having "incorrectly rendered" portions of such statements, we still have to focus on the real issue at hand which is the "accurate" interpretation of historical documents or facts that have been left by the real players that "actually knew Jefferson personally" and lived during his lifetime 
 This is among the most boring movies ever made.  All the actors give weak performances and the ending makes you want to go to sleep 
 What really bothered me about Hudsucker Proxy: Capitalism is the wonder of the world providing food and subsidence to everyone, even Communist slaves and Fascist toady's under a democratic people; yet, Hollywood insists on blasting Corporate Culture, when the overwhelming majority of businessmen are not only honest, they are exemplary.   So much Hollywood talent and money wasted on a bad idea, so what else is new?  The Coen's have jumped the shark with this take off of the American Screwball Comedy of the 30's.  I cringed every time Jennifer Jason Leigh tried to imitate Katharine Hepburn's classic gargle.  The poor actress may have destroyed her career with this stinker.   I can't stand Tim Robbin's politics, but must admit that he is the best actor to play a fool in the movies.  He almost carries this farce.  Paul Newman; however, is collecting a check.  He's been collecting checks since the 50's.  His salad dressing stinks too.  I'm amazed at how much money the Coen's command in Hollywood on such flimsy pitches.  I loved Fargo and enjoyed The Big Lebowski (not as much as some cult fans), but this film, why did they bother? 
 I do usability inspections as part of my job.  I bought this book based on Nielsen's reputation and the description of this book here on Amazon.com.  I was very disappointed to find that this book was scholarly, not practical.  After scanning the book, I returned it for refund 
 When I played the first composition on this CD, I started thinking that  perhaps I had purchased a really stellar CD because the first song was  really jumping. But after that, this CD is disapointing to me. There are  maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally  unmemorable. With the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her  first CD, Joyce Cooling could have made one good CD. But, in my opinion,  there aren't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this CD. Joyce  certainly has potential, but she needs to work on her creativity. She sound  here like an artist still maturing in style 
 Please save your money! The so called "Heroine" was so annoying I sided with the bad guy. Enough said. 
 You would learn more from the Protege OWL pizza tutorials. The book has no discussion on inferencing or how to actually make an ontology with OWL. The one example is simply a representation of the hours that a business is open. It could be expressed in plain RDF(S) and does not provide any indication of the power of OWL. For example, it directly specifies the hours for each day. A better example could define hours in terms of the type of day (weekday, weekend, holiday, Thanksgiving) and then infer the hours for each day.  The book uses unusual terminology holonymy, hyponymy, etc. (generalization and composition, respectively) OWL forms only half the book with the remainder covering URLs, XML,RDF, RDFS. Removing that material would have allowed OWL to be covered in appropriate detail.  Only the XML/RDF serialization is described, which is only used for exchange between tools. There is no discussion of the abstract syntax, N3, Turtle, etc that all provide a more human readable serialization 
 I get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide!?  The one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night.  Why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself!?!?  It is not matching the character 
 This book waste a page to explain: download speed = file size/bit rate even with ilustration (WOW). The rest of the book has the same technical level. Amazon, dont you check what you sell 
 Vaillant's book, from any expository writing standpoint, is poor. He also doesn't address, let alone explain, the psychological/psychodynamic aspect of drinking, which was beyond his purview but exactly what I was interested in 
 Jane Smiley's _A_Thousand_Acres_ had a great deal of potential.  It had a powerful plot (King Lear) that has been little-adapted in modern times.  Smiley chose an interesting and rich setting in her modern day heartland farm.  However, the actual execution of the book leaves much to be desired.  First and foremost, Smiley writes exactly like a writer who has just completed a college writing program.  She uses smart and subtle humor (one may say wit), metaphors and similes.  The problem is that one is conscious at each and every juncture that she is using a simile, a metaphor, or a quip.  While more seasoned writers might have woven beauty into readable text or else have chosen to complexify and engage a reader, instead she chose a middleground that is neither challenging nor readable.  The reader constantly is forced to swallow some rather ridiculous metaphors, all the while conscious that they are swallowing a textbook, but ridiculous, metaphor.  And while the plot taken from Shakespeare had a lot of potential, it was handled quite inexpertly.  Yes, Smiley chose the intelligent path and abandoned Lear about 3/4 of the way through (so that everyone doesn't die).  However, once again, she writes in a way that makes every reader -conscious- that she is adapting Shakespeare, and at times the plot seems ridiculous in its current setting.  Yes, she sheds new light (the protagonist is the Goneril-character, who was a Shakespearean antagonist) in a very intriguing way.  Yes, she invents new excuses for her behavior (former child abuse)... however, had she not tried so hard to make the reader conscious that she was adapting Shakespeare, these plausable interpretations might not have seemed -in-plausable.  All in all, a book with many potent seeds that were not sown to anything near their full value 
 Although I enjoy the stories in this book, and am interested in the subject matter, I find the book almost impossible to read.  Every sentence ends in an exclamation point-it is so manic!  manic! manic!  I haven't been able to finish it-I can only take it in small doses because while I read it it seems as though everyone is screaming and breathless (which, who knows, they may have been-after all it was on a ship in a storm).  Just a little hard to read, but very interesting 
 The book is filled with plenty useful advice but it is so poorly organized that its potential effectiveness is marginalized.  I had hoped to learn some key strategies and tools to use in a converstation.  However, I spent  most of my time trying to understand how each little tidbit of advice fit  into the bigger picture of actually starting and controlling a  conversation.  Somewhere amongst all the advise are the key elements to  becoming a better communicator but its left to the reader to assemble them  into a practical guide to conversation 
 Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the "strongest/purest" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 "perfect" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.  Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with "the deathbed edition" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.   I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.   To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for. The "true" editon, written by a YOUNG Whitman at the height of his powers.. 
 My smoker arrived dented and chipped, which I wasn't happy about but I could live with -- I don't expect a relatively inexpensive outdoor oven to maintain its new look after some wear and tear anyways.  However, the rails along the sides that hold the shelves are not welded together well.  In fact, two rails arrived completely broken off (opposite sides and at different levels) and a third was tenuously held in place by a single weld.  I thought that the broken-off rails were parts to be used in the oven's assembly; otherwise, I would not have unboxed the smoker and put it together.  I would have returned it.   Because I had assembled the unit before realizing that it was broken, I thought that replacing the broken parts would be easier than disassembling the unit, re-crating and returning it.  I called the distributor three weeks ago to order replacement parts that have not yet arrived.  I've already waited longer than the distributor indicated I would have to before receiving the parts.   If alternative gas-fueled smokers didn't cost a multiple of what this costs, I'd be really angry.  Hands down, this is the most unsatisfactory purchase I've made from Amazon.  In spite of the impairment of not having a fully functioning smoker, I have seasoned it and used it once.  The chicken I made was promising. (My hope that my experience with this smoker will improve lets me award a rating of 2 stars based on this one use.) If I ever get the parts I need, I think the smoker will be adequate for initial experimentation with this kind of cooking.  If I like the results, I'll replace this smoker with a better one 
 Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us. 
 Although the author claims in the forward that he is merely relaying these conspiracies and has no opinion, his extremely biased opinion is starkly apparent throughout.  Additionally, some of the accounts are relayed using blanket statements without a source or explanation as to how the conclusion was arrived at. If a particular conspiracy did not fit the political views of the writer, it was vehemently attacked.  If it did, many crucial points were glossed over.  According to this book, the CIA, FBI, and the Mafia, have been the root of all evil during the 20th Centur 
 If I am not mistaken,this is Jonathan Kellerman's third book involving a suspect religious cult.  It gets a little tiresome.  The plot was not as suspenseful as his books usually are.  But it is easy reading, and the writing is entertaining enough to read if you are a Jonathan Kellerman fan 
 Although I normally enjoy Kate Atkinson's books, I didn't like this one.  It goes back and forth between dreams and reality and it is hard to tell which is which.  I didn't even finish reading the book, although, I must admit, I did read the last chapter 
 A broad view of vacation homes. Chapters on Colorado, Florida, etc. Not really enough "nuts and bolts." Would be good if you are in early stages of deciding to get a vacation home. A good websurf would probably provide more info 
 This is a revision of the "salad shooter".   Leave this one on the shelf, guys and gals, and go out and buy a real food processor.  It doesn't handle the medium not to mention the tough jobs, and it is a real pain, literally, for anyone with an arthritic hand.  Mine went to the Salvation Army after just one use.  Maybe there it will be worth ten cents to someone who needs a sturdy cardboard box 
 I bought this book to prepare for my relocation to Qatar (from Australia).  The book is so out of date it is downright useless. For example, even basic information such as visa requirements is wrong (you *can* get a tourist visa when you turn up at Doha airport). And recommendations about what's on, what's good, what's bad are meaningless - many of the things described don't exist any more or have been superceded.  I was seriously considering sending my book to Lonely Planet and asking for my money back, but it's easier to hop onto the web and complain instead. More useful too!  Having said that, I don't know of any other guides to buy instead. My suggestions are:  If you're planning on moving to Qatar, do. Quality of life here is fantastic, except that outdoor activites are curtailed by the heat most of the year. Recommend you get in contact with someone who lives here for tips.  If you're planning on a holiday to Qatar, don't. There is almost nothing here for tourists, except for 4WD'ing on the dunes which is unique and fun (go for Arabian Adventures, they're the best operator). I would recommend instead Oman (for the scenery and Arabic culture) and Dubai (shopping, astonishing real estate developments)  Back to the book: Completely out of date, and you can pick up the history bits off the net. And I'm just talking about the Qatar section here, no comment on the other two countries (but I would *really* question why you would want to go to them 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen

 Two things about this book are depressing. First, the author has no patience or self-discipline, and thus cannot possibly learn to play piano well. So why does he go on this "quest" to obtain an expensive piano? The real reason, which goes unsaid but runs as a sad subtext through the book, is that it is easy for the author, who has money, to spend that money on a piano, and the satisfaction of owning the piano serves him as a substitute for the satisfaction that would be gained from learning to play it. The second reason this book is depressing is a quality that this book happens to share with countless "personal journey" memoirs that are coming out these days. It is that the author does not have the discipline, education or interest to write a serious work of non-fiction about pianos, piano manufacture or piano playing, and so turns to the much abused memoir format to squeeze a book out of what are, ultimately, mundane experiences, shallow insights and personal challenges that are ultimately abandoned 
 Though this book has lovely quilts, it is very light on technique. It is more a showcase for the artists quilts. I purchased the book hoping for concise clear instructions and possibly some patterns to get started; this book has no patterns and is really light on instruction. If you enjoy looking at beautiful quilts only, then you will enjoy this book. If you are looking for something with a lot of technical info, keep looking, this is not the book for you. 
 This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.  Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.  This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this.  
      The Mulberry Bird would be most appropriate for your family if you have a fairly closed international adoption where the birthmother took care of the child for a while before relinquishing him/her.  It would not be as applicable in an open adoption situation or where the child was relinquished at birth.          The story itself is fairly contrived and very sad.  The mother bird really loves her baby bird but after many weeks she realizes she cannot keep her son safe by herself (the father bird flew out of the picture before the baby bird even hatched).  She visits the wise old owl for help and he suggests that she give her child up for adoption.  Does he help her by returning her baby to the nest or by finding food for it?  No, the ONLY option the owl presents the mother bird is to give her baby bird up for adoption to a faraway bird family (of a different species) and to say good-bye to him forever. She reluctantly agrees but always loves her baby bird even though she is no longer with him.  The baby bird forgets all about his life with his birthmother.       This story may be a good discussion starting point for some adopted children, but it just as easily could give them nightmares.  This book was so heartwrenching it caused my four-year-old daughter to sob quite hard after we read it, so hard that I could not even discuss the book with her.   I am going to wait a couple of years before I try reading it with her again, if at all.  Worst of all, the story only somewhat applies to her life, and I worry about what images the book has put into her head. Now I must endeavor to clean up any erroneous ideas that the Mulberry Bird Book gave her and to help her understand that her own story has both similarities and major differences.  
 I was thrilled when I found this book, since it was one that I'd been wanting to read for quite some time. I'd heard it was partly totemic, partly Otherkin-related, and so my curiosity was piqued.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the result. This is one of the reasons I'm not a huge fan of the New Age. The author claims to have channelled the entire work through communication with a "higher being" that watches over humanity, and is in fact one of a number of these higher beings. As is common among New Age channelling, the message is uber-positive, "love" and "peace" are thrown around like confetti, and the general message is "This generation is ever so special-time for you to realize your potential!"  Nowe, I have nothing against love, peace, and achieving one's full potential as an individual and as part of a society. Gods know we need more of that. The problem is that this particular conveyance of that message is wrapped up in a bunch of cultural appropriation and seriously revisionist history. We have a Caucasian, New Age author supposedly channelling information about Native American cultures, everything from White Buffalo Calf Woman to Hiawatha and the Iroquois League (the entity he's channelling supposedly was one of the main players at the forming of that treaty). It's pretty much a cliche, and it's a classic example of cultural appropriation. And, also in the style of the New Age, the channelling includes the idea that, prior to a point 2,500 years ago (conveniently at a time and place where we have no written history) the Native Americans were all peaceful and living in a virtual utopia-I'm surprised he didn't try to claim they were all vegan. And all of human history has apparently been manipulated by these higher powers-apparently humans themselves can't understand reality beyond a certain point; we have to have a higher spirit to help us.  Now, I have no issue with Unverified Personal Gnosis. However, it's important to view any UPG, no matter how inspired, with constructive criticism. The fact that most of the material matches with New Age revisionist history rather than commonly accepted history should be cause, at the very least, for skeptical comparison. The entire work, though, is presented as genuine, without any critique or questioning whatsoever. No, it's not romantic to analyze one's meditations and question them. But it's also not healthy to romanticize Native Americans as the "Noble Savages" while thousands are barely scraping by on reservations across the country.  This book would have been better off if the author had taken the results of his channelling efforts and distilled them into a direct critique of modern society, adding a grain of salt for good measure. He could have discussed the virtues of literal vs. metaphorical understanding of what he received. There are some good points in here, including the idea that a person can evolve beyond the basics of everyday life, and that the way we're doing things now is a Bad Idea. However, they're so wrapped up in apocalyptic fantasy, cultural appropriation and the basic assertion that we're essentially being directed by higher powers (instead of by our own wills) that the lessons in here are all but lost in a sea of drek 
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 ...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.    John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.    A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.    It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.    It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.  Watchable, but barely.  The Player covered this terrain so much better.  
 While this is an attractive volume, well-printed andwell-bound, and does include a nice selection of Lovecraft's best, Iwould not recommend it.  I really enjoyed Ms. Oates' notes in the front of the front of the book: interesting and well-written, so what's my problem? She provides synopses of the stories, giving away the plot and ending. What fun is it to read a novel, when you've been told the ending in advance 
 I'm not sure.  Maybe it's because I'm not a Gurdjieff follower or studier, but this particular book seemed like it was written by the founder of the Ego Strokers Anonymous Club.  Throughout, Gurdjieff doesn't talk as much about other remarkable men as how remarkable he himself is in these meetings with these others.    He consistently portrays himself as a sage, a knowledgeable business man as well as mystic philosopher.  He's just good at everything gosh darnit!  Not my cup of tea, but then again, maybe Gurdjieff wrote this book in a manner that it would only appeal to his real followers.    Whatever, in the end I persisted through it and was very disappointed- I found no good messages. In fact I barely underlined a single kernel of mystical, business or any other wisdom.  Rather unfortunately, I ended up making notes in the margins to dispute some of his arrogant assumptions and "know-it-all" expressions.  Perhaps I'll find one of his worthwhile works at some other point in my travels, but I doubt I'll ever come back to this one to look for anything. 
 This book takes the technology of 'readability' to new lows. The author clearly takes much pride in his extensive knowledge of the English language. I'm not saying you won't get useful information from this book,  it's just such a painful process. We all had classes we enjoyed and those  that put us to sleep. This is the class you had to bring coffee to. It's  also an invaluable resource if you want to learn countless stringent  guidelines for drawing an ER diagram 
 I have to say I am rather disappointed with this item. Considering its price, I was expecting a firm control garment. It's not that it isn't well constructed and it is very comfortable, but it isn't anything approaching what I would call 'firm-control'. I don't think it would qualify for the title 'moderate-control'either. Much too expensive for what is essentially a light control briefer 
 The episodes for Naruto are quality but in this case, due to errors in the description I can not recommend the DVD.  When I ordered the DVD, I made sure to check the language options of the DVD.  This one indicates that a Japanese language option is available.  Unfortunately this is incorrect.  If you do not mind this being an all english DVD with the television broadcast editting, than this is for you.  Naruto is not so far editted compared to other anime series that the series is hampered and the english actors do a relatively good job with the translation.  However, if you prefer the japanese version, this DVD is not for you. 
 Although there is much informative basic material in this book, I cannot stand the fuzzy math this author uses.  The percentage gains he reports in some of his examples are blatantly deceptive.  An example is Fig. 5-10, where he shows the possible gains achievable using the "gap" method.  He quotes a profit potential of $21062, which I dont dispute.  However, there is no mention of the actual money necessary to make the trades shown, which is probably somewhere around $30,000 (minimum).  This would yield a profit of around 67%.  The figure, however, quotes a profit return of almost 700%!!  Whether or not these figures are his, or if he borrowed them from another source does not matter.  He should know better!  This sort of misleading "fluff" does nothing but confuse the amatuer and leads to the expectation of gains much better than realistically possible with a small account balance.  Throughout the book, math like this is used to over exagerate possible gains from day trading 
 Whenever Clint Willis finally gets around to compiling a book about hating Saddam Hussein and Osama bin-Laden, then Clint and his cronies might have some credibility.  As it is, their blind hatred and knee-jerk reactionary attitudes against Conservatives have produced reams of commentary...loopy, mean-spirited, small-minded ideas that are fundamentally wrong about nearly everything in the world.  These pundits' loathing of Conservatism has blinded them against the real enemies of America and freedom.  Ironically, it's the Conservatives who provide the strength, vision, and courage to defend the rights of Liberals to spew their opinions. Hatred...that's what this book is.  At least truth in advertising is in effect here 
 This is a philosophy book. There is almost nothing about natural selection and not much more about religion, just plenty of standard philosophy loosely connected to a condemnation of current western culture and its supposed pseudoscience sustenance. Midgley uses the term 'evolution' to mean the philosophizing of scientists and science writers. As religion too is human philosophizing it is hardly difficult to make the two converge.  This 'evolution' Midgley citicizes as being too human-centred. As there is nothing more human-centred than the social sciences, humanities and religion and this 'evolution' is really philosophy then it is an empty criticism. Only the physical sciences look beyond humans but this is unacknowledged.  She is, though, correct in saying that natural selection is not about progress up a ladder nor about a hostile, doom and gloom world. Other than this her grasp of biology is suspect eg she asks how genes can be selfish when they die when the cells they are in die!!!!! No wonder the excellent work of people such as Dawkins is beyond her grasp if she does not understand the connection between body cells and germ-line cells.  Though I generally agree with Midgley's concerns about competitive greed and the destruction of our planet I think she is wrong to blame science, pseudoscience or sociobiology and to disconnect people in modern western culture from their ancestors and their cousins in other cultures. She is clearly out of her depth when it comes to biology, at least.  With a statement that evolution is the creation myth of our age plus the eye-catching mistitle of this book Midgley is far more guilty of hyperbole and melodrama and potentially far more misguided and damaging than, for example, Dawkins when he used the 'as if' selfish gene perspective.  There are a few interesting discussions of works by scientists and philosophers but, especially for the science writers she criticizes, I would very much recommend people read the books themselves and not simply accept Midgley's views on them. 
 I bought this book to see China's potential growth in every respect. I am very disappointed after reading the book. At the introduction of the book author gives his solution as "Double the military and double again if needed be. Build more B-2 ,F-22 , F/A 18 airplanes. Mobilize the industry for munitions production. Go forward for ballistic missile systems". Also he curses Clinton Administration countless times for its foreign policy and promotes Bush presidency. He claims that Clinton got campaign money from China and favors them. What about Bush-Saudý-9/11 connections? Not even a word.   He also trying to show Chinese Regime brutality like selling weapons to both sides at Iraq-Iran war (no word from Senior Bush, and Oliver North), Selling guns to 3rd world countries and make money (No Saudi-US gun Trade mentioned), no respect to UN decisions (What Mr. Bush did in Iraq?) Selling missile systems to Pakistan while US forcing sanctions (Mr. Bush lifted the sanctions after 9/11 to non-Democratic Pakistan regime).   He insists that's why US must declare war against China, not strategic partnership like Clinton did. Strategic partnership gives China open ýtself to the world and influenced by democratic system. On the long run, Chinese people will select democracy and bury the old communist regime like East Europe did.   There are many right points in the book like Týananmen Square Massacre, but the these accurate points fades due to being Clinton hater.   If you want to learn something about China, this one sided, extreme rightist book is not the one. Do not buy it and do not read it. 
 I connected all the cables as instructed, but it doesn't work, the light is not on. So I return it to Amazon 
 The plot was interesting, but less complicated than I expected it would be based on other reviews, and the "surprise" killer was evident from the beginning. The story is gruesome, but not as terrifying as it could be, and not shocking considering what else is available in prose and reality now. The writing was choppy and pedestrian, reminiscent of a high school short story with certain words replaced by "thesaurus alternatives." In such a common joe book, why use "masticated" instead of "eaten"? The book is written as a screenplay and would make a better movie than a novel. Also, the author continually quotes T.S. Eliot without explanation of why the character has these complex, provocative thoughts and only names Eliot as the author of the phrases in an author's note at the back of the book. Elsewhere in the book he uses "Only that and nothing more" as his own words, almost word for word the well known writing of Edgar Allen Poe ("Only this, and nothing more."-The Raven ) Recently another author's work was pulled from the shelves for using such similarities of "internalized" work. Not worth the time, read a spoiler if you want to hear the story. It only took me a few hours to burn through the book given its low level and I wasn't terrified, thrilled or surprised 
 Thank you for your interest.  Shout!Factory"  For the record, the episodes included are: Legends of Poker Borgata Poker Open Grand Prix de Paris World Poker Finals World Poker Open LA Poker Classic Bay 101 Shooting Star WPT Championship  Now, the Bay 101 Shooting Star event is terrible, featuring some horrible play by Danny Nguyen, which I actually find insulting to watch.  They've missed out the events won by Eli Elezra, Eric Brenes, Carlos Mortensen, [one of the wins by] Daniel Negreanu, John Gale, Alex Brenes, Maciek Gracz and Arnold Spee. (Perhaps it's worth noticing that in so doing, they've left out wins by 6 non-Americans. Surely it couldn't be that the WPT only want to show American winners in a ***WORLD*** Poker Tour?)  In the past, they've produced standalone DVD's such as Bad Boys of Poker, Ladies Night and Battle of the Champions. During season 3 they had several such events:  Ladies' Night II (with Isabelle Mercier, Cyndy Violette and Clonie Gowen) Poker By The Book (with Mike Caro, TJ Cloutier, Doyle Brunson, Phil Hellmuth, Mike Sexton and David Sklansky) Young Guns (with Scott Fischman, David Williams and John D'Agostino)  Still no news on these events either.  The WPT are, quite frankly, foolish for not wishing to release the full season, and until they do so, they won't be getting a purchase from me, particularly when rival TV shows such as Ultimate Poker Challenge and Poker Superstars Invitational have done 
 I placed a substantial order, mattresses, sofa set, table set and cocktail tables with this vendor and they cancelled my shipment becuase the cost to deliver the items they said was "too much" Nothing in their ads states they will cancel your order for such a reason and they state the shipping charge on the items and their site.  This was a great inconvenience to me and I feel they are not a reputable dealer and do not conduct their business in an honorable fashio 
 This book is, in hindsight, horribly wrong. It is now known that there are no WMD's in Iraq. Saddam did not pose a threat to America and the world at-large. It's just sad that the trumpeters of the Iraqi war were playing to the wrong song. It's packed with faulty and "highly dubious" intelligence. The CIA has since admitted as much but I do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a "massive intelligence failure" 
 I agree with those that say this book would be more useful if it came with solutions.  Right off in the first chapter, hypothetical situations are presented without any background information in the text.  If you haven't had some experience in Accounting, you are going to be left scratching your head.  The instructor in my class says that it causes you to think.  Hard to think if you have never come close to experiencing anything that is being discussed.  Some guidance would be helpful 
 In less than 3 months the seals didn't work because the velcrow came apart.  Everything inside gets wet.  Poor product 
 Despite all reviews posted here in this page are given 5-stars to this release, I need to be honest and explain why I am giving just one poor star. No, I am not crazy. Let me explain my point-of-view, and after that you can decide if this JH album really deserves more stars. Just to start, this album does not have a spinal-column that could guide the band(?) or the musicians thru a solid path. There are tracks played by a duo, trio, 4tt, and sometimes a very loose quintet, and each of these tracks have a different mood, without any presence of a jazz soul, or even a real smell of jazz. Maybe the intention of recording these tunes was to make a homage/tribute to Mr Strayhorn, or maybe a recognition for Mr Henderson value in the 20th century Jazz History as one of the most important hard-boppers ever. But the result was very poor. If you really love Joe Henderson (as I appreciate), try any of his albums from the 60's (as a band-leader or as a sideman), mainly those from the Blue Note era. In time: I gave one star, in memory of his brilliant carreer. This particular album deserve zero-star. 
 "The Last River - The Tragic Race for Shangri-la".......Tragic. Yes I'd agree that this book is tragic. Tragic that I bothered reading it.....tragic that I paid for it in order to read it.....tragic that Todd wasted his time writing it......tragic that I disliked it so much that I can be bothered writing a review. The warning should have come upon examination of the back of the dust jacket. "Advance praise for The Last River" it reads. In retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it. It seems that Todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be, and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal. So much of the content has so little relevancy to the story, that you soon tire trawling through it. This was my third Tsango experience. I do recommend the Outside documentary on the Lindgren expedition. "Hell or High Water" is not outstanding, but is worth a read, but on this book, my advise to Todd is please make this the Last River that you drag through the wringer 
 I was a bit disapointed in this book.  It is basically a blank journal for you to write in.  I was expecting a diet guide 
 This book was poorly written. Its plot was somewhat implausible and the characters were anything but dynamic. It seemed more like a screenplay thinly disguised as a novel, as it possessed very little literary merit. I would not recommend this book to anyone who values his or her leisure time 
 I received this book as a Christmas gift because I was interested in the Laci/Connor Peterson case. I'll admit that although I followed the case for a good amount of time, I stopped paying attention to news coverage once I found out about Amber and Scott's relationship. The whole thing disgusted me so I stopped watching/reading the news. When I got this book I was thrilled because I figured it would be neat to hear Amber's side of the story.  This book goes into detail everything about Amber's life, before Scott came along, during, and after. Amber uses this book to defend herself from the media's attacks on her personal life. I find it disturbing that she makes herself out to be a good, Christian girl (mentioning it several times throughout the book) and yet she admits to doing pretty "anti-Christian" things. She also defends her relationship with Scott, claiming that the two of them were in love, although she also says that she knew that he lied to her about his relationship with Laci. She portrays herself as a victim in this case yet she contradicts herself in so many ways.   If you don't know much about the Laci Peterson case, I suggest you read this book. As a warning, however, I will let you know that after reading this book you will have a strong dislike for Amber. And she certainly brings it on herself 
 I'm afraid that I was not as impressed as the other reviewers.  The book failed to mention that you need to have InfoPath installed to run some of the exercises.  There is little of how a real world configuration might look.  It does give some "click the screen" simulations of what the program might do.  But then, you could get the same thing by installing it yourself.  It would have been a worthy effort by discussing the structuring of a business collaboration project, then explaining and expanding business information storage, retreaval and search to tie it all together 
 I usually don't like to write negative reviews, and I'm sure that for many people this cd is wonderful. If you enjoy it I think you should get it. But as for myself, I find it very unpleasant. The crystal bowls produce a kind of low pitched hum that gives me a headache every time. There are pleasant sounds too, some higher pitched tinkling sounds but the hum is almost continuous and really ruins it for me. I bought this one with Seven Metals, Singing Bowls of Tibet about two years ago. Seven Metals I love, I listen to it almost every day. I practice meditation and love good meditation music, especially Tibetan bells.But Crystal Singing Bowls I really can't take. So before you order do listen first if you can. 
 Her premise is spot on.  If you are going to expend the effort to bring up emotions, use them for courage: the courage to do incredible things that will inspire the audience.  I really liked the sound of that, so I checked out this book.  Her 12 step technique is pretty much a rehash of method techniques.  There may be some twists lent to them from her empowerment philosophy, but I didnt see many real, applicable differences.  I wasn't drawn in by her writing style either.  I have read some acting books that got me burning to get back on stage, and this wasn't one of them.  I will admit, I enjoyed chapters 9 (which talks about making the most out of business) and 10 (inner monologue).  I think it's because these are ways to get your impressions OUT THERE for people to look at.  Even though she says she is trying to get away from it, most of her technique is too internal and too analytical.  Ivana Chubbuck, like many others, preys upon the insecurities of actors, and their need to be "the best."  Don't fall into the trap of buying into yet another self-righteous acting coach/guru.  A technique like this is far too rigid, and will do more harm than good. You will end up wasting your time and/or money and hurting your acting. Trust me when I tell you, you DO NOT need this book to act with courage or act to win.   If you are looking for a modern, fresh approach, buy "How to Stop Acting" by Harold Guskin instead 
 This would have been a good skit, or maybe a short story, but not an entire novel.  The book is tired like the town Wigfield 
 I liked this book in the end but it took me awhile to warm up to the two people in the story.  The girl was a bit of a witch at times and the guy could be a real jerk.  I thought she was kind of pushy and demanding.  He was kind of shallow.  But by the end, I did start to warm to them, but he did still continue to be a jerk.  I think it was an ok book to read, but in the end I never fully came to like either one of them.  I have read better chicklit 
 I am only in my 20's but I did grow up listening to the original album of A Chorus Line (my mom used to play it while we were cleaning) and I gotta say that this remake is awful.  The original cast had great passion in their voices and the new cast is very blah.  I don't recomend this at all.  If you really love and appreciate the music find a copy of the orginal and I know that you will enjoy it much better 
 I really wanted THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES because I thought that the story of the Mothman would be fascinating reading, a really intriguing narrative of the sightings of the tall, grayish man with wings and red eyes who could take off in flight straight up off the ground, an interesting examination of the myth and the legend. There is something to me very frightening about this type of legend, and I was eager to read the exploration of sightings around Point Pleasant, Va., in 1966 and 1967 before the Silver Bridge collapsed and nearly 40 area residents died in the tragedy. What a great tale could be told, I thought...  I am still waiting. This book is not well structured or told. It seems to be the dumping ground of every otherwordly event Keel has ever seen or heard of. There is little narrative arc here or suspense. Keel has the mistaken notion that loading the book with every bizarre occurence he's ever been told or witnessed gives him credibility, but it is actually the opposite. He and his "colleagues" saw so many UFOs and strange lights in the sky in West Virginia (and other places across the country) in the late 1960s, that one simply cannot believe that there isn't more corroboration of these sightings.   Keel does say that he doesn't believe in beings from other planets, but rather beings from a dimension outside of our own who like to make trouble for us, find things out about us, and sometimes warn us of things that are going to happen. Because of their inexperience with earth time, they often use out of date slang and drive old cars that are in mint condition and still smell new. For some unexplained reason, the "people" from this other dimension seem always to wear thick-soled shoes.   Keel as a true believer is a poor writer of a convincing book, as he often justifies a witnesses credibility by saying that they are respectable people, or some such qualifier. He anticipates, then, no need the reader might have to be convinced that thousands of sightings of UFOs and Mothman may need some evidentiary backup. This lack of the writer's disbelief and proof, the lack of any plot or arc and the muddled content of the book make this work a solid disappointment. Someone needs to let me know if the book that can be written about this ever is written 
 I had read a lot of John Irving when I was younger and was excited to read a new book of his. But this very long book is way below his usual standard. The characters are unlikable and not believable and it just goes on and on. If you want to read John Irving try his earlier work 
 The hardcover and the e-book version should not be linked together because the e-book version is only 12 pages! Complete waste of money, I wish I could return it. I made the mistake of reading the review of the hardcover version (which is shown on this page too), and since I had already read the original book, I though I was making a bargain. The joke is on me... :- 
 They have better charts in Excel templates 
 I have ready many books on manifesting the desires and this one was little out of Focus as I am not sure why Author wanted to make this book as 250 page book where she could have reduced it to 50 pages , giving exact steps 'What need to be done' instead of giving whole theory of 'Metaphysics'.  I was little surprised to read , author mentioning about Altar and Rituals, which I never felt a part of metaphysics or in achieving your dreams.   She often mentions about 'Jeep Cherokee' which I thought , was useless as she gets because of Dealers Favour and Her Mom's Love, nothing spectacular about this. This is Total Coincidence !.  I am not facscinated by writing style as she 'keeps on and keeps on.' and reader may get confused 'What I really Need to do ?' thoughts.   There are better books in the market and this is one 'Sure to Avoid as it will confuse the heck out of you'. Examples are of Pure coincidence and nothing of Pure Metaphyical here and author stretches this book to 250+ pages.   Authour could have made this book better by telling 'What need to be done' and 'What happens when you do this ' as there are lot more books on this stuff everywhere but it seems that she missed the Whole Point...    Read 'Mind Magic' by marta instead. Avoid this book.  Jay 
 A reviewer below has made a mistake, or his review was misfiled:  This compilation is not to be confused with "King of the Delta Blues SINGERS."  THAT is the compilation which contains the alternate take of "Traveling Riverside Blues."  It and its companion, "King of the Delta Blues Singers, Volume 2" also have much better mastering than any other Robert Johnson collections that I am aware of.  Unfortunately, between them, ten alternate takes have yet to be upgraded from either mastering of the "Complete" collection.  I have not heard "King of the Delta Blues"--I am basing this information on the song sample Amazon has provided.  But given the song lineup, this is a confusingly unnecessary product 
 Considering Nora Roberts' reputation and clout, you would think she'd insist on only the best as a narrator.  To begin with, this is the third book, but the first two were narrated by someone else, so there's no consistency.  The narrator of the first two books, David Stuart, was ok, but this person, Guy Lemonier, STINKS!  He seems to be merely reading the story out loud.  There is no differentiation between characters, making dialogue hard to follow, and considering he's narrating on behalf of a character, Phillip, who is supposedly the son of a doctor, I find it ludicrous that he doesn't know how to pronounce words like Imitrex (a medication).  Also, all three books are abridged to the extent that many of the funnier moments are omitted, and all the dialogue with Ray and Stella as ghosts is not included.  Don't waste your money on the CD version 
 I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer 
 Tried very hard to get through this book, but in the end gave up.  Don't need a paragraph to describe a blade of grass.  Put me to sleep 
 Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds.   There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.  If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter.   There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera.   Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs.  What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting.  Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post.  If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.  Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly.  I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me.  When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter.  Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters.  I originally thought, "it is Canon, it must be quality."  Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters.  This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.  PROS:  Can be used for film or digital cameras  Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting   CONS:  Bulky and heavy Not neutral color balance 
 Not that I know everything about crime - especially getting away with it - but A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM made it look too easy. Performances by Michael Caine as a done-wrong-now-doin'-wrong angry executive and Will Patton as  the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on  television.  But A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM needed to close a few holes in its  story to make it worthy of your movie theater/home video payment 
 I was eager to read this book only to find it a terrible dissapointment.  One would think that a 'scholar' such as he would have at least a basic understanding of the Hebraic roots of Judeo-Christianity.   It was obvious that he clearly was clueless to the known Messianic signs spoken of in the Gospels.  He is also clueless to the Pharisidical Judaism of the time..not comprehending that all of Christ's teachings were completely in keeping with true Judaism. All of which can be found in contemporary Rabbinical teachings of His time. This book, which some unfortunate readers will swallow as truth will only continue to propagate a backward understanding of the gospels.   Like it or not..the New Testament writings are Hebraic and explain what fulfilled Judaism is.  Those who need to divorce Judaism from Christianity are offering a church which is already confused, just more confusion. It is through studying the Hebraic roots that we even begin to understand the 'difficult' sayings of our Lord; 'fullfillment of the Law', binding and loosing (the Law)..etc as well as the parables.  The delivering of the deaf mute..was a Messianic sign, because the Rabbi's knew that 'they' had to ask the said demon its name but He did not.  Lazerus's resurrection was a Messianic sign because the Rabbi's believed that anyone could come back to life during the first 'three' days after death.  Cleansing of a leper was  Messainic sign because the Rabbi's understood that it was a 'divine' punishment, that only God could lift. How else can we link Isa 53 with the 'stripes' He was to received as part of fulfilling the punishment the Law required for transgression, and yet 'minus one'. Had our Lord transgressed the Law, then the Jews themselves could have legally killed Him.  Remember Paul (Saul)?  He also does not understand John and his huge part in the whole picture, in that the Kingdom 'began' with John.  He was the 'breachmaker' as fortold in prophecy.  This is Hebraic roots 101.   People, please study the Hebraic roots of Christianity and do not waste your time with this book. The fact that he keeps defending his position as 'not' anti-semetic, should give you a clue 
 ...this is nothing like the Spirograph I grew up playing with.  As everyone else mentioned, the gears are much too thin and slip constantly.  My 6 year old son was completely frustrated after wrestling with the design flaws.  Don't waste your money! 
 Why did they have to produce this album.  From start to finish all the tracks blend to white noise in my ear.  This was a severe disappointment.  Even more disappointing then Eve.  At least Eve had some tracks that you could 'aquire a taste' for not so with On Air.  If you're a collector buy it as cheaply as you can and let it gather dust otherwise don't waste your time and money there are many more memorable cd's out there.  I, unfortunately, own the cd and have listened to it many times and I can't even begin to tell you what one single lyric is on the album.  That is if there are any.  
 The opening poems in this collection, the more recent ones, gave me reason to think I wouldn't continue with the book, for they consisted of pseudo-formal poetry at its most representative.  Line breaks and stanzaic patterns had completely lost touch with meaning and content.  After these poems, the collection improves, at least marginally.  Every now and then a rhymed or off-rhymed piece appears, and many poems use either a loose pentameter or a free verse line of which, as Theodore Roethke would say, one can see the ghost of formal verse lurking behind it.  Pinsky uses assonance and consonance to enrich his lines; concrete imagery and language are plentiful, which will please readers who look for this feature first and foremost; but few lines herein are really memorable.  Still, I would single out poems like "Shirt," "Icicles," and "From the Childhood of Jesus" as noteworthy ones 
 I will not be passing it on to a friend.  The ending left me irritated; why should I close a book with questions in my head?  I will not buy another Picoult book.  I felt "snookered" by Keeping Faith and now I have been fooled twice.  I have to say I did enjoy the book up until the ending, but the Hannah ghost plot was unfulfilled and I was surprised to find out in the middle of the book that Ellie had short hair.  Why didn't I know that before?  Obviously, the characters would have benefited from better descriptions.  
 Lamp puts out very good, non-flickering light.  However, it is cheaply contructed with the lens cover easily dislogded.  For $100, this is unacceptable 
 Admittedly the idea of narrator being a corpse is a very intriguing hook for a film.  Thus Lado's debut begins with much promise.  It seems to have the makings of a fine giallo.  Where it completely and utterly tanks, however, is in the gialloness itself, for this isn't a giallo so much as it is a conspiracy story dressed up in the thinnest Hitchcockian device of a vanishing girl.  To me, what makes giallos so fun and fascinating to watch is the sheer edginess of the violence and sex.  You will find none of this here, except for an atrocious orgy scene.  There really isn't even that much of a body count to provide an added element of menace-come to think of it, aside from the dead narrator, there really wasn't anything menacing about this movie.  The climax and unravelling are both a joke:  Lado couldn't seriously expect any view to swallow the kind of world domination theory he was trying to shroud his film in.  He'd of done better trying to marginalize the threat/'menace' in the film as was done in a far superior manner with the Prisoner television series (when our hero was spinning in a chair and getting freaked out looking at a chandelier) where the setting was a tiny village in a remote and isolated location.  Finally, could somebody please explain the title?  I don't remember any reference to a glass doll at any part of the story.  If it's a metaphor, then both it and the title have to be the mother of all cinematic non-sequitors 
 Moore sets out to blame guns, rather than the people who make Prozac and other 'designer' seditives for the massacre at Columbine High School and runs afoul of Mr. NRA himself, Moses, better known as Charleton  Heston. Heston, gentlemanly as he is defeats all futile arguments Moore, an anit-gun (mostly) leftist has v. the Second Amendment. Long live the second Amendment, otherwise the First Amendment is gone, too! Moore should wake and wise up. Better Moore efforts that are highly recom- mended are: The Big One, Fahrenheit 9/11, Roger and Me and even the un- derrated Canadian Bacon 
 My wife dropped the original remote and it quite working.  It turns out there are PCB's inside and one surface mount connector to the other board came loose so I resoldered it and it worked for a little while, probably until the next time she dropped it.  I bought the updated remote and one drop was all it took to disable the receive part of it also.  Could not find the problem this time.  It still transmitted, but eventually quit transmitting after the alarm was on.  I unlocked the truck manually and every time someone opened or closed a door the alarm would go off and I could not start the truck.  I messed with it (while in the parking lot of an amusment park) for a long time and evetually got it to stop, probably by entering valet mode, I'm not sure.  Don't waste your money on another $100 remote.  I am shopping for a remote that is transmit only without the LCD.  Should be more reliable.  My suggestion is to buy a system that comes with 2 remotes: One LCD and one simple.  Better yet, buy a system that does not have the feedback, or 2 way, and save a lot of money and headache.  You won't use it anyway 
 Everything is fine, everything is OK. The simplest answer is the most likely.  Conspiracies are made up by left-wing wackos with nothing to do.  Did Iran-Contra ("Ask about the cocaine!"), Tuskegee, MK-ULTRA, Latin American germ warfare, Bay of Pigs, Allende overthrow, CIA LSD research of the 50s, '66 NY subway experiment, and the Arbenz coup in Guatemala all happen?  No they didn't.  Oliver North acted alone and was deranged and crazy.  E. Howard Hunt was a deranged loner who tried to kill Castro.  Uncle Sam was a crazy deranged lunatic that give African Americans syphilis in 1932.  He acted alone.  God bless America.  I love our leader.  The more than fifty people that died after the Kennedy assassination all committed suicide.  They were distressed by Oswald's murder of Kennedy and could not go on living.  Shame on you Mr. Oswald.  I love you Mr. Posner.  You're a lot better than that Oswald guy.  Mr. Posner: would you please write a book debunking the claims of The Chuch of the Sub-Genius?  JR Bob Dobbs is a nut and must be stopped.  God bless you and your people 
        This book was tiresome reading at times, with many mathematical tables of which were put in the book to provide an alibi for whomever might disagree with the man and how he came to the conclusions he had done. I must agree with one of the reviwers of this book --- " Who cares?". I mean ultimately, it will be the readers themselves that will judge what exactly was the greatest and productive findings in history.   The Techonologically inclined will say that Science is the master of all that is and the more liberal arts type will insist that the Arts is what defines a culture. The fact is that both do because both hold a sea-saw effect, without imagination there is no science and without science there is no reason for a human being to think beyond what reality tells him to be so. It is science that produces better paints, better materials that lets the Artist craft and produce --- so why pit them against eachother?    It is that point that I will give this particular book 2 stars, as well as the way it was made. The side notes in a terrible headache making Blue with white type was a horrible idea. The reading was very drawn out and I've read better on far more drier  material.  The fact the guy took a good few years of his life to do this seems kind of odd, and I question it --- one should wonder, why? Somone could have made the arguement that the West had a far more promenint mark on the world in far fewer pages and time then this particular author has done. 
 I've been looking for weight lifting gloves, and trying out gloves that seemed to work for me but either bled onto my hands or ripped.  These gloves, however, dried out my hands and made me use lots of moisturizers.  They also tore down the knuckles on my left hand and in between the thumbs.  Weighlifting gloves are yes supposed to keep your hands dry during work outs and to prevent calases.  These gloves dried out my hands completely and gave me calases.  If you want a good pair of gloves do not get these 
 There is no such entity as an addictive personalty . Often  the author belittiles ,  mocks   and  discounts what a substance Abuser  says .

What the non medical term Dry drunk means is a person is  not using   or moderateing with out the help of a 12 step program   The reality is most people quit or moderate on thier own with out the religiious gibberish  of a 12 step program that many    have begun to veiw as a  dangerous cult   Please   seek other advice based  on emprically   reviewed science not  ancetdotal     nonsense dreged  on out dated relgious  dogma .  12 step treatment is nothing more than faith healing and the last time "denial " was used as  evidnece    of something was during the witch craft trails in te 16,00s . It is now 2006 we can do alot better than this.   
    ******What is the first thing you know about a man that does not respect himself? ------He does not respect anybody else, either!*****      Chapter by chapter,  the lesson material in this book is lacking in depth, and certainly,  it is already available in other books.   James Eades personally, however,  is one of the finest individuals active in the promotion of chess.  The exception I take is the marketing gimmick in the title.    "Chess for Dummies"  by James Eade  holds an appeal for such persons  as are very intimidated by CHESS as a game. I want to make it very clear why I am critical of this book. It is overpriced. Books like this  rely on coy language in the title, to "hook" a beginner.  However these DUMMIE chess books  are not as good as many other titles already in paperback,  man of them which are priced lower,  about $17.95 and less.  NEW copies of "Chess for Dummies" are currently selling  elsewhere for $4.24,   and the market is a good benchmark of a book's impact.      I suggest the reader search carefully in this book.  Does the author refer to HIMSELF as a "DUMMIE"?  ....or is it only YOU who is the "DUMMIE" ?        Calling yourself a DUMMIE is self-destructive behavior,  pure & simple. If one must think of himself/herself as a DUMMIE,  what's the point in starting out learning a game where one must think for himself and face constant assaults upon the EGO,   SELF-ESTEEM,   and personal CONFIDENCE?    The pattern of negative reinforcement and negative self-talk destroys most beginners after a short experiment in the game of chess anyway,  and James  Eade  reinforces this fatal affirmation.            Playing chess will either destroy the notion that you can think of yourself as a "DUMMIE"  (a postive outcome)  or the individual will even more strongly regard himself as DUMMIE because he loses games (negative outcome).  It does not matter how many books you buy.  If you think yourself a DUMMIE,  you will play like one.       And in Westminster Colorado this week,  a 14 year old girl was attacked by an adult male on her way home.  She had not learned to think of herself as a "DUMMIE" in her Karate class.  She knocked her assailant down to the ground with a single punch to the head,  and got safely away.        As a teacher of chess beginners,  I introduce every new student to my two rules:   RULE#1:  "Never,  EVER,  beat yourself up!"  RULE#2:  "LOVE yourself a lot!"    That's the first lesson in the first class;  but then,  I'm training players to win and to respect themselves in much the same way that the KARATE student is taught to respect himself and others.  Regarding one's self as a "DUMMIE" might sell chess books;  but it will never make you a chess player.       The MASS MIND  makes it "cute" or "coy" to refer to yourself as a "DUMMIE";   but James Eade is not William Shakespeare,  and this is a different kind of tomfoolery.   Of course,  what do you call someone who hands  over his money to the guy calling him a "DUMMIE"?  It's like:  AUTHOR:        "Hey, bud,  you're a DUMMIE!!!" BOOK BUYER:    "Gee, thanks man. Here's Ten Dollars."       Of course,  you can learn some "beginner"  chess in the book, but that's hardly the point.  What are you going to do when you want to move up to the next level?  Are you going to search for another book titled:  "WINNING CHESS,  FOR DUMMIES WHO DON'T WANNA BE DUMMIES?"          Such books will eminently qualify you to wallow in the shallows of "casual" chess,  winning an occasional game against weak players,  right up to the point where you give up the game completely. Chess is a useful tool and one of its benefits is that it teaches us how to release our innate intelligence.      Several exciting movies have been release about chess in the past ten years:         "SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER"       "KNIGHTS OF THE SOUTH BRONX"       "THE LUZHIN DEFENSE"    I cannot remember once hearing the main character (either child or adult)  referred to as a "DUMMIE".   Think about it.        Then again,  James Eade, much to his credit,  has just come out with  "The Chess Player's Bible" a beginner's book to which I gave a five-star review.  I respect the author a great deal for his newest book.  By the new standard set in his "Bible" Eade is terrific chess teacher.     
 After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try Skeleton Man as my first Hillerman novel.  Unfortunately, I'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it.    I read a lot of novels and have never really had a problem with this before, but I find Hillerman's writing style to be very choppy and awkward.  I find I have to re-read sentences to catch the meaning because it just doesn't flow smoothly.     Here's an example of one paragraph that I opened to randomly:  "Getting this ceremonial procession from Tuve's village on Second Mesa to the canyon rim and them to the riverbank involved describing several more stops for prayers and offerings, the placing of painted feathers in the proper places with the proper songs, and putting prayer sticks where the proper spirits traditionally visited.  By the time Tuve had brought them to the Hopi shrine at the tribe's cliff-bottom salt deposits, Joanna Craig had looked at her watch three times that Chee had noticed.  Navajo fashion, he hadn't glanced at his own.  Tuve would finish when he finished."  It's like he talks in short cuts that you're expected to follow. When I'm reading this book, my mind is wandering all over the place because the text doesn't draw me in.  I'm glad he has a lot of fans out there, but I'm not one of them 
   This book was a huge dissapointment.  Every single layout was the same. Arrange your sofa and loveseat facing each other, throw a crappy plant against the wall.  The pictures were dated looking and in black and white.    There is nothing this book has to offer that you cannot glean from watching 1  evening of HGTV 
  I found Russell S. Bonds'   "Stealing the General" to be a great disappointment.  Upon receiving the book, I eagerly checked the index for references to my ancestor, Ovid Wellford "James" Smith.  Then to my chagrin, I found that the author went  to great lengths to portray Ovid as an interloper undeserving of the Medal of Honor!  Unfortunately, since not a lot is known about  this young man, who volunteered  to be a soldier at the age of 16 and at age 17 volunteered for the Andrews Raid, the author resorted to conjecture and derogatory statements.  Ovid and fellow  raider, Samuel Llewellyn, were referred to as "wayward would-be raiders".  They WERE raiders, of course.  They WERE NOT "wayword" , but had followed orders and joined a Confederate  artillary unit when it became necessary.    The author notes that Ovid was "missing" from the 1888 Reunion of the Andrews Raiders.  That would have been a good place to inform the reader that Ovid died twenty years earlier.  Instead, Mr. Bonds begins a new attack; this time on the young man's father, whom he describes as so "seemingly untroubled by his son's lack of involvement in the operation" that he "actively lobbied  the War Department for his son to receive the Medal of Honor." The truth is, The Reverend Samuel Smith wrote ONE letter asking that his son be put on " the same footing" as the other men.  Samuel Smith was a highly respected ordained Baptist minister who was revered by  his fellow citizens in  Parkersburg, West Virginia.  He would not have asked for something his son did not deserve.    The author was so intent on convincing his readers that Ovid was not deserving of the Medal, that he didn't  bother to mention that this "young pup" (his words) spent several months in Swims jail in Chattanooga, as did the other raiders.  This may have led to his death at the age of 23, but that is only conjecture.  Conjecture, over time, can come to be believed as fact.  That is something that troubles me about this book:; an abundance of conjecture.  It may make the narrative more exciting, but  then the reader has to try to sort out the fact from the fiction. In this book, Bonds has done a hatchet job on Ovid Smith's reputation as an Andrews Raider. In the early 1900's all of the Medal of Honor awards were reviewed, including Ovid Smith's . Ovid was found to be worthy of his Medal. And that's a fact!  When I read something that I know is not true, I find myself doubting the accuracy of the entire book. And sadly, that is how it is with this book.  If you are interested in the Andrews Raid, buy  "The General and The Texas" by Stan Cohen and James G. Bogle.  Colonel Bogle is the ultimate authority  on the subject of the Andrews Raid.

 Disappointing in both technical and artistic sound.  Will probably give the cd away to get it out of my collection 
 george cukor only ventured into musicals on rare occasions. two of those ("a star is born" and "my fair lady") are classics; "les girls" is assuredly not. this was gene kellys last mgm musical, and cole porters penultimate score of any kind, and neither master is at his peak; as a matter of fact theyre both pretty close to their nadirs. kellys attempt at parodying marlon brando in "the wild one" (already a passe reference by the time this was filmed) is downright embarrassing, and the supporting "girls" (when mitzi gaynor is the biggest star among them) just kinda sit there like a lump. if thats entertainment ... 
 Let me accept the fact that LOTR is my most beloved film and I already own the extended editions of the films in one set! I'm really not surprised to see New Line coming up with another edition of the trilogy. With films like these they will squeeze the collectors as much as they can!! Still, inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped Costa Botes documentaries, my advise to anyone buying LOTR for the first time is- DO NOT BUY THIS SET! Spend a little more and you get all the movies in full 6.1 DTS EX glory, alongwith hours of endless in-depth bonus features which probably you'll spend rest of your life watching!!  Please be aware, these new editions DO NOT contain DTS tracks, no commentary tracks by the director, Weta workshop or the cast. All you get is both versions crammed into one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second disc...AND NOTHING ELSE. It would have been a better idea had New Line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again....And even this is not the end, once the HD format gains a little more acceptance, they'll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy!  Beware, Extended edition set is the ultimate LOTR experience, in terms of films or bonus features. Go get it...Its worth all the money spent! 
 The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that, the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book.  I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it.  Without those details, the book seemed "unfinished".  It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.  Boring in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                            
 Back in 2003 T2 extreme was released which was an excellent version of the movie.  Not only did it have excellent extra features, but it had the extended version which is wonderful, and a 1080p version of the original theatrical version (i.e. this one being reviewed) playable via home computer.  Now, at the time the requirements were quite steep in order to view the movie, but to todays computer standards it is minimal.    I watched the blu ray version at a friends house, brought over my T2 Extreme edition, played it on his computer next to the HDTV, and compared the two.  There was hardly any difference and if there was the hat went off to the computer version.    Why do I mention this?  Because this blu ray is over priced and has nothing for extras.  You want the best version of T2 you can buy?  Then walk yourself down to a local wal-mart and go to the $7.00 DVD rack and pick up Terminator 2: Extreme Edition.  You'll want to shoot yourself if you don't do it.  HECK, BY 4 OF THEM FOR THE SAME PRICE AS ONE BLU RAY VERSION!  There's your Christmas presents!! 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 China Mieville's first two novels set in the world of Bas-Lag gave him a well-deserved reputation as the most important young writer working in the sci fi/fantasy genres today. In Perdido Street Station and The Scar, Mieville created a neo-Dickensian milieu of bizarre, terrible, but deeply compelling grotequeries inhabited by complex, often-conflicted characters. Both narratives gained momentum over hundreds of pages, even as each sprawled further into and then away from the teeming city of New Crubozon, and  all of it was illuminated by Mieville's powerfully intelligent, pleasingly baroque prose style.  So, what happened with Iron Council? Mieville's third Bas-Lag book is confusing, meandering, and populated by shallow, underdeveloped, highly unlikeable characters. His writing style is choppy throughout and routinely defies the most basic rules of grammar and usage; perhaps he was aiming for profundity (think David Foster Wallace), but he achieved only preciousness at best, and tedium more often. The narrative-such as it was, given his penchant herein for flashbacks, deus ex machinas, and withheld information-had holes in it one could (pardon the pun) drive a train through. The plot progressed as if he didn't know where it was going when he was writing it. Above all, Iron Council was agonizingly dull-I could hardly wait for the book to be over with and finished.   Many have correctly noted that this is Mieville's most explicitly political novel. Since his politics are Euro-socialist in character, perhaps you might think I was put off by that-but no. I am myself that rara avis, an American social-democrat of long standing, and I have little but sympathy for tales of community-level collectives (a la the Paris Commune) or worker oppression (a la the transcontinental railroad)-and both themes and their thinly veiled historical antecedents are prominent in Iron Council. But largely because of Mieville's failure to draw fuller, more sympathetic characters (Cutter is a whiny jackass; Judah Low is a cipher) or to sustain a believable and interesting narrative (the Council itself is an irritating community prone to sudden, inexplicable shifts of opinion as to its raison d'etre-but never mind, as it doesn't finally appear until hundreds of pointless pages have passed following the interminable wanderings of Cutter & Co. and the similarly unlikeable Ori back in New Crobuzon), and with it all undermined by his annoying staccato voice and sometimes incoherent descriptions of events, whatever merits Mieville's radically politicized story may have had get thoroughly lost in the shuffle.  In his previous novels, nothing felt like a "set piece"; everything that happened usually played a crucial role in why subsequent events turned out as they did. In Iron Council, by contrast, one senses more a rote succession of staged novelty acts, as if Mieville were making use of every half-developed idea he'd ever had. (Take the attack of the "inchmen," for one instance.) In a similar vein, the major characters in his earlier Bas-Lag were sometimes morally ambiguous, but that just made them consistently interesting and complicated. As many have commented, the most noteworthy thing about two of the major characters in Iron Council is their homo- or bisexuality, and yet while this is a promising and perhaps vaguely daring premise in the usually hyper-heterosexual world of fantasy fiction, it seems a choice made more for shock effect than anything essential to them or the plot. Their sexuality is clearly intended to be-but is very poorly realized as-vital to these characters' "being-ness," and thus it contributes almost nothing to our understanding of them. In fact, Cutter's passionate possessiveness toward Low makes him seem, more than anything, one-dimensional and frequently grating-hence, Cutter's sexuality becomes more of a negative trait, which seems rather incongruous with Mieville's anti-intolerance politics.     SPOILER ALERT-Just a few plot objections concerning the end of the book (though there were plenty of others throughout): Why wouldn't the militia have destroyed or booby-trapped the tracks just outside of New Crobuzon? Why hadn't they sought out and found their cohorts and the Council in the weeks prior to the train's approach, just as Cutter had? Why can't any of the refugees from the city give the Council a reasonably straight answer as to whether or not the Collective had already been vanquished? (It had.) And most of all, how does the "time golem" manage to continue in existence even after Judah Low has been killed? Finally, and in a completely different vein, why does Mieville use the word "career" as a verb over and over again?   But enough already. I have never before had my expectations so shattered by an author. I am astounded that anyone would think that this book is on a par with-or even better than-Mieville's previous Bas-Lag novels (though the wider consensus seems to be one of disappointment, more or less). Unfortunately, though, Mieville received some of the best and widest mainsteam-media reviews of his career with Iron Council, and if he believes his clippings, I'm afraid we may in for more outings like this. But his earlier works provide a far better indication of his prodigious talents, and so  I will fervently hope that he can still return to that form with his next novel. 
 I had to read Annie John for my English class and I can say that it is probablly one of the worst books I have read yet.  Not only are the characters difficult to relate to, but the book is extremely dull and written as a comeing of age story. Basically, the book starts out with Annie, the protagonist a girl growing up in Antigua remembering how much her mother loved her when she was a young girl. Then, in the next few chapters, Annie describes herself as a 12 year old girl going to school and having an overpowering love for her friend Gwen.  She has behavior problems and does some things that her mother seems shamed about and she further distances from her mother. The next couple chapters, she is an akward 15 yr. old in classes with older girls who are more developed then she is as she puts it and she dislikes this.  At this time, her thoughts that her mother doesn't like her have escalated into her hating her mother and her thinking that her mother returns these same feelings.  She doesn't love Gwen anymore and feels lonely.  Finally, when she is 17 she leaves home and goes to train to become a nurse and oddly actually will miss her mother even though throughout the book (for the most part) she has shown strong resentment and hatred towards her mother....Anyway, this book was so extremelly horrible and I hope you don't ever read it. If you decide to read it or are forced to I pity you, because this book is trash and I don't see why anyone would publish it...BIG MISTAKE on their part.  
 The darn thing broke almost immediately.  When I tried to switch gel covers (it comes with 3 different sizes) the entire earpiece came off in my hands!  What a flimsy piece of crap.  I just sent it back to Amazon. I'm never buying a Jabra product again 
 Shevonne the imperial hoodrat or whatever you claim to be.....you wouldn't know about being a hustler if Ice-T slapped you with your tampon. Its painfully obvious that you don't have any music knowledge due to the fact you enjoy ignorant, inbred, klown music. I am sure you do relate to the lyrics because you definitely have the iq of a tree frog. And no I will never reach that level.......or should I say sink to that level because I never move backwards with my intellect only forward.   Dem Wack boyz are one of th worst groups out there to date.  Support real emcees like Mos Def, KRS-One, and Immortal Technique 
 This insight into TV journalism is about as interesting as a look into my parent's vacation to Florida. O'Reilly was obviously under the mistaken impression that his life in journalism and the places he traveled to were somehow fascinating enough to make into a work of fiction (or a work of anything, for that matter).  And his main character: Tommy O'Malley (wasn't he one of the Aristocats?) About as dull and dumb as a bag of hammers (which someone ought to whack O'Reilly in the groin with). To sum up in a forthright, no-spin manner: this book sucks. I should have seen it coming, when my bid for eight dollars on Ebay was the only bid for five days, and turned out to be the winning bid (though, "winning" is hardly the term I'd use after listening to this piece of garbage). Since O'Reilly's a fan of torture, he ought to donate this audio CD for use in interrogating prisoners, if the Geneva Convention will allow it 
 Nothing new or original. What we have here is a cd of already established, previously released, original version, but none the less good deep house music that is just simply mixed and cross faded together. If you are a new comer to House music than you will like this cd. For those who have a good collection of House, you will find that many of these songs are from some of your other cds. For exellent, funky, infectious, deep house, you should buy Nude Dimensions Naked music. Tracks 6 and 13 from this cd are on it. You'll love it 
 Do NOT buy this book if your child cannot read.  There is no cue to turn the page.  Why would a company make such a ridiculous item?  Who do they think is buying these books?  We buy them because our children can't read.  
 I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!  If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it 
 This is a fun film and one of the few from the period where Jet just seems to have some fun and go off. But this is a pretty sorry release for it. So Tai Seng is releasing widescreen laser disc masters again? Niiicccee. Wait for a better release. At least that one might not have a Ric Meyers commentary on there. If there's a sure sign of a lack of care from a company releasing kung fu films, it's Meyers' name anywhere on the product. 
 Waller is usually awesome...but I think he missed it on Puerto Vallarta Squeeze.  Not that I wasn't entertained, because I was...in a mindless sort of way.  The book is a made-for-tv script just waiting to happen! But mediocre Waller is better than most at their best....so buy this book....used if possible 
 It broke after one month.  It was fun while it lasted, but I would hesitate in purchasing this if I were you 
 Thanks to the other reviewer for the heads-up on the copy control. I've had too much trouble with it, so I avoid CDs with copy control. This near-criminal practice should be banned, or at least we should be informed by the seller, since it makes CDs essentially useless for those of us who listen to all of our music on our computers or MP3 players 
  Pilzer's general proposition is that the market place will take care of the health insurance issues in this country if we just let the free market operate.  He maintains that individual health insurance is widely available at reasonable cost and people, including employers and employees,  should take advantage of the individual market for health insurance.  I believe he tends to force the facts to fit this basic proposition.   He is easy to read with a breezy style.  The book has pretty good explanations of HIPAA and COBRA and a number of good tips.  However, health insurance in the United States is complicated.  The price he pays for simplicity is accuracy and thoroughness.  It is a pretty good book if you are 35, perfectly healthy, and thinking about buying insurance. But what is good for when you are 35 is not necessarily good 5, 10 or 20 years later. (Should I pay for drug coverage?. . . pregnancy coverage?)  I would never rely on this book for making policy decisions or for forming opinions on healthcare in the United States.  I strongly disagree with many of his policy recommendations.  Some problematic propositions from the book:  1.  Several places in the book he claims that insurance companies in the individual market only turn down or place exclusions on 20% of applicants and 80% are accepted as healthy.  He uses this statistic to support his idea that most people can get coverage in the individual market. I don't know about the accuracy of this statistic, but one problem is that people who are uninsurable often do not apply for insurance on the open market.  They stay on their employer plan.  They go into a risk pool. They buy a conversion plan.  Etc.   Even Pilzer advises against applying for insurance if you think you might get turned down. So the healthy gravitate to these plans and the unhealthy do not.   Pilzer doesn't discuss what "healthy" might mean and his discussion of the underwriting process doesn't describe what are the typical issues that exclude people from coverage. He does not address the possibly of  the healthy fleeing to cheap plans while the unhealthy are trapped in what they already have, causing greater  cost disparity.  2.  For those who say they can't afford health insurance Pilzer claims that "If  your annual income is below the federal poverty line, about $20,000 for a family and $10,000 for a single individual-you probably qualify for Medicaid."  This simply is not true, unless you have children at home, are disabled, or meet some other special category.  Low income alone does not qualify a person for Medicaid.  In this same vein, he claims that of the 45 million uninsured, 16 million earn more than $40,000 for a family of four  ($20,000 for a single)  and 29 million earn less.  He assumes that the 29 million earn at least $20,000 if a family and $10,000 if single.  Otherwise he claims they would be on Medicaid.   He maintains that these low income families could easily buy a low cost HSA plan.  But how are they going to pay those big deductibles?   Also, his cost data is for people age 35 and their families.  In most states, the older you are the more expensive insurance gets.   In this discussion, he ignores the issue of underwriting and possible exclusions for preexisting conditions and ignores the fact that in most states, this population could not afford the risk pool which runs on the average, 200% the cost of the same plan for a healthy individual.   3. "Despite what you read in the newspapers, there are health insurance optionsavailable for every American, although it may take you some time, effort and expense to get them." This is one of his soundbite quotes he uses in advertising materials for his book.  This is misleading.  Insurance on the individual market is not available for many people.  The risk market policy will have preexisting condition exclusions and may have coverage riders unless you are coming off of a group plan and have HIPAA rights.  The risk market may be unaffordable.  If you don't have HIPAA rights, there may be no option for you at all in some states.  4.   He states that "the premium you pay for an individual or family policy cannot be raised each year, nor can the policy be canceled based on your health or your prior year healthcare costs."  He mentions this several times in the book.   At best this is a case of overgeneralization, at worst it is a misleading statement to support his thesis that individual health insurance is the solution to our insurance woes.   I have read a lot about health insurance.  Federal law requires guaranteed renewal of individual health insurance plans.  Does this mean that rates cannot change based on your health status?  Many state's insurance regulators think so. But that does not make it law.   Most states allow rates to increase based on age. Some states' laws do provide that your rates can't go up based on your personal health situation. But other states have no laws that apply and in general, the individual market is not highly regulated.  From what I have read, experts are not in agreement as to the extent re-underwriting occurs on renewal and insurance companies are not very forthcoming with information about why a particular person's rate increases.  Some experts believe that re-underwriting is occurring more and more by a number of insurance companies.  Also, some insurers have durational rate settings.  This means that your insurance costs can go up considerably after a few years.  At that time, you can reapply for a lower cost policy, but can be denied if you are not in good health.   4.   Pilzer repeatedly claims that individual health insurance is cheaper than employer provided insurance.  It probably is cheaper if you are 35 and healthy.  Probably not if you are 60.  This is because employers charge the same rate to everyone, whether you are 20 or 60. Also, only 4% of people in the US have insurance on the individual market.  So it is a small part of the overall market. Pilzer doesn't break down what that market looks like as to age and health of its participants.    5.   Pilzer's discussion of the uninsurable and state subsidized programs like riskpools leaves much to be desired.  Mostly because there is so much state variability.  This is another circumstance where I really disliked that he used figures applicable to a 35 year old male.  The costs are considerably higher for those 50 and over.   He fails to mention that some risk pools have low lifetime limits and other restrictions.  6.   Pilzer pushes the idea that small employers should go to a reimbursement model, leaving their employees to buy health insurance on the individual market. Employers with older/sicker employees are in fact facing higher costs.  However, their employees are going to have problems getting insurance on the open market and may end up with only very high cost options.  The employer that has a young and healthy workforce already has lower costs 
 Let me be blunt - if I played this song to my love she'd slap me for insulting her with this dreck. What an awful voice he uses; how could ANYONE bear to listen to this more than once? You have to cringe thinking there are young guys who play this thinking it'll have some seductive effect. What an embarrassing song - for Blunt and anyone who likes it. But the real question is this: why would you pay the virtual ransom to own this track when it will appear on a future 1-hit wonder cut-out bin compilation? Even then you'd still be paying too much to get this formulaic pablum 
 We meet Josie Flynn a soon to be divorcee, who is just starting to get over her divorce from Damien. For her winter vacation from work she is headed to New York for her cousin Martha's wedding. While on the plane, she is seated next to the charming and handsome Matt, the rock journalist, who is also recently divorced. They share their horror stories, and seem to becoming friends. Once they land in NY they decided to meet for an afternoon at the Statue of Liberty. After this point the book serisoulsy goes down hill. We are then treated to a cat and mouse game while Matt is looking for Josie. Throw into the mix an unbelievably lavish wedding, an affair (or 2 depending how you look at it), an ex husband who comes toting an expensive gift to win back Josie's affection, and a duck and it make a very unbelievable book. 
 Men and women have equal sex drives,deal with it!What makes us  different is the constant shaming women get when they do indeed act sexual.If you have the word "slut" hanging over your head constantly it just might make you want to cling to romance in order to appear less sexual than a man.Gray generalizes,and not only generalizes but makes women out to be sexless objects there to please men and not themselves. He writes as though he has a great fear of men and women being  equal in sex drive.His mysogamist views of women are  disgusting! In short what he says is,the woman only has to look nice for the man,and the man has to romance,begg and trick women into  bed because women in his mind really don't want or need sex. 
 Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.    The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read.         
 I'm fascinated by the rave reviews for this text. I used it for a community college stats course and once I was in the classroom with it, I became aware that I had some problems. It is true that it's written in a friendly style and has plenty of exercises, but I found it to be poor preparation for my students who will be going on to higher levels of statistics in behavioral science courses.  I found myself explaining, more times than I wish to recall, how formulas look different in other statistics books, and I was disconcerted at the lack of use of symbols that one usually sees in beginning statistics courses. Simple terms most commonly used in statistics were not introduced at all, and most statistical tests were not mentioned. Many students found it to be cumbersome and a bit overwhelming.   It's my own fault, really. I did not spend enough time perusing texts. And my familiarity with statistics prevented me, when looking it over, from realizing how much was really missing. I realized that my students would enter bachelor's programs lacking some very basic information that is always used in statistics for the behavioral sciences. Most of my students plan to earn graduate degrees; I had to spend quite a bit of time preparing notes for them as well as lectures explaining formulas, symbols, and terminology that "some of" their higher courses might use. And with nary a mention of ANOVA or any other higher level tests, I felt I really had done my students a disservice.  I began to wonder - have I been out of school so long that things have changed this much and I'm not aware of it? But - as I am teaching at a state college, stats texts started trickling in from other publishers. I saw that it was not me. This massive text, costing my students $120, is lacking quite a bit that they should be exposed to - to better prepare them for future statistics studies in the behavioral sciences. This was certainly a bitter lesson for me! I had to waste far too much time putting together information that was missing just so my students would have the course they should have.  I recommend Sally Caldwell's text, "Statistics Unplugged" for beginning students - at least in behavioral sciences programs. It's a third the cost, a third the SIZE, and much more reader-friendly. And it contains the information that I had to supply to my students just so they would get what they paid for.   I do not recommend this book. I'll certainly be much more careful in future when choosing textbooks 
 The unit is very basic. I only needed a basic gps so i purchased it. The price was really good. I was very disappointed when I used it. I took it to a  trip and did it let me down. The initial directions were ridiculous. It took me of the highway and put me back on the highway several times. Then, when i reached the hotel, I took the directions for a mall (which has been there for 10 years)... The unit was off by 5 miles. It said you have arrived to your destination but I was pretty far away from my destination. The nice people at a gas station helped me get to the mall. On my way back, the gps just died. I checked the battery and it was dead. Th battery lasted less than 2 hours. I was extremely dissatisfied with the unit. Thanks to amazon.com's awesome return policy, I returned it. 
 Up to you, but I would buy a generic branded battery of the same type (Lithium BP522).  I bought a generic battery and it works just as well -- saved me $50  
 Hi, I have all the 3 famous book of Kevyn Aucoin (Making Faces, Faces Forward and this) and this one is the worst. Why is this the most expensive? I don`t understand 
 Buddy Holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th Century Masters series.  Every one of the CDs in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous.  This one is no exception.   Look elsewhere 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 I guess I'd better confess right away: I didn't finish this book. I only made it a third of the way before I was too disgusted to finish it. I'm sure there are many useful things I could learn if I could choke it all down, but it was very difficult.   I don't think it helped that I just finished The Case Against Wal-Mart by Al Norman.  I think it's great that Wal-Mart was able to bring goods to smaller towns that really didn't have access to a department store or discount retailer, but I can't get over the desruction of American businesses, American jobs and the terrible wages and benefits for American workers (not to mention all the foreign workers who produce Wal-Mart goods) that have become standard operating procedure. Lower costs at any cost is not a responsible way to run a business, and while I agree that Soderquist did a great job at making himself rich and the company successful, I think the damage is costly 
 This was ABSOLUTELY the worst movie I have ever seen!! Its so slow I started dozing off throughout the movie. You have no idea what is going on in the movie! Which some plots/directors/actors can pull off but this one at the end leaves you feeling like "What in the world??" You were hoping for some kind of clarity or grand ending where everything ties in but leaves you feeling like this was the biggest waste of my time and movie. There was no action what so ever, there was no climax, it wasn't scary at all and not thrilling....I really hate this movie... 
 I would have given this book no stars if I could.  My Bible study group and I went through Ransomed Heart and loved it.  I can't believe how disappointing this book is and I would not recommend it.  Mr. Eldredge hides his anger (barely masked), arrogance and deceit in this book.  Do not buy it 
 Now, I agree with about 80% of the things the author is skeptical about.  I mean, I don't believe in them too.  However, the hair starts to go up on the back of my neck when yet another Western white guy dismisses every cultural belief that is not his.  The definitions of many items discussed are not even remotely correct too.  It reminds me of when a born again Christian rips apart every single world religion because they know the "truth."  What are you supposed to gather from this, that all indigenous people and other cultures are stupid because they aren't backed by a US drug company? Acupuncture is really a dangerous delusion?  That gets real old.  It's a little 1860 pioneer type thinking to me.  I think if I were actually interested in a topic such as Chinese medicine I may rather go to better sources than one Western guy's 2 paragraph dismissive definition.  Kudos to the author, it must be nice to know absolutely everything about absolutely everything and be able to discard it all in favor of Western thought in one book. ; 
 During the late 1980's and 1990's,The Looney Tunes stayed a float thanks to the brillant writing and direction of Terry Lennon and Greg Ford.That era came to a screeching end with "Space Jam". The only thing funny about this movie is it's laughable plot,why on god's green earth whould the Looney Tunes need Micheal Jordan's help? Most of them are clever enough to fight any sort of enemy on there own, well at least they normaly are. This film made them all look like a collection idiots,the only one that didn't look stupid was Bugs Bunny. Now I know that not all the LT gang was ever as smart or clever as Bugs,but put them all together nad they can all handle themselves.I think the biggest hit was Lola Bunny,who is simply not funny or interesting at all.I suppose she was created just to statisfy the P.C. police. The laughs in the film are few and far in-between. There was one moment during the basket ball game were the Looney Tunes gang actually corporated and were actually funny and in character,but that ended mighty quickly.Avoid this movie like the plaugue. 
 Man! this movie is soooooo boring. I literally slept through this movie. If I die not having watched it again ill be happy.   i dont even know what its about cuz i watched it when i was like 5 yrs. old, but i dont care cuz just thinkin bout it makes me wanna cr 
 This is another book that implies it's for power users, yet most of what's in here can be found in any garden variety book on how to run Linux.  Only part of this book is aimed at "geeks".   The promotional text on the back cover implies that it's aimed at sysadmins. And while *some* of it is, most of it is stuff that a system administrator would already be familiar with.  Much of what's in this book is the same stuff aimed at beginning to intermediate Linux desktop users.  It's not for real "geeks" or sysadmins by any means.  If only the truly useful stuff for sysadmins/geeks were included, the book would be 1/3 it's size.  It's not that it's a bad book; it's just not marketed well at all and has a very misleading title.  I found it a complete waste of money.  It's hard to find books for "intermediate to advanced" users. I figured this would be one of them. It's not.  I was quite disappointed 
 Most first novels really are not that great but usually when an author produces a sequal there is a definate improvement but I found no such improvement when trying to read this one.  I figured I owed the author a second chance by reading his second novel.   What can I say, for all the hype, this book is typical of many published this day by members of the self styled 'Creative Class'. Politically Correct. As subtle as a Hammer. As narrow minded as the generation that the author condemns except far less productive and much less imaginative. Hardly any good.   Truth is I found it rather juvenile. In my my mind I found myself editing out the excess wordage. Perhaps half could be deleted without effecting the story. There really isn't much here.  Indeed It isn't a good story. No challenge to the reader at all. Blow away the baddies with modern super technology which to make it sporting the baddies are allowed to have some of.    It has all the defects of the first book compounded.   Toss it. 
 I have had two of these now.  The first one broke, and I thought it was because I messed it up when I cleaned it.  It actually worked well when it did work, and was relatively inexpensive, so I bought another one.  This one broke within two weeks.  
 This took me forever to read - it was like a job.  I feel it was so boring, just a bunch of whining, and complaining.  PC goes on and on about Anna, we hardly hear about Lucy, or Marino- and supposdly TLP is Lucy's deal?!?!  I just got through it hoping the next one is better.  I have to say the last 3-4 chapters were very intense and exciting 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 I read and enjoyed The Faerie Wars a few months ago, and so was excited to start the sequel when I came across it. My excitement waned as I got into the book, however. There were three things that particularly disappointed me. Through most of the book, there are a number of subplots happening simultaneously which come together in the climax. Brennan breaks the subpolts up into small peices, telling about this one for a few pages and then that one for a few pages, and then this other one, and then back to the first one, and so on. It seems that he wants to create suspense and keep the reader engaged, however for me it just made the book awkward and choppy. I had some trouble keeping the plots straight and understanding why certain episodes were significant to the overall story. There are some that I still think are totally irrelevant. I realize that this is a work of fantasy and not meant to be realistic or anything, but some of the things we encounter in the book are completely unbelievable. He introduces a whole new group of faeries, the forest faerie, who are very numerous, have advanced technology, and are skilled fighters. Where did these guys come from? How did they get so good at combat if they've been hiding in the forest and never fighting anyone? And how is it that they're so numerous and yet have never been detected? It just doesn't add up for me. It seemed a quick, cop-out way to get things done. Like he needed a force to take on the deamon army, so he made these guys come out of the woodwork. Then there's the ending. I didn't appreciate the values that are condoned in the ending of the book. I'm not going to tell any interested readers exactly what happens except that the main characters, the "heroes," pull off a very significant act of deception in order to get their way. While it does end up leading to a happy ending, I can't accept that they got there by immoral means and got out of accepting responsibility for their actions. So in general, I was didn't like this book a whole lot. I won't be reading the next sequel should there be one 
 A friend going through the same problems as I am was strongly recommended this book by her therapist and she bought it for me, as well.  I was enthusiastic to read it and at least understand these emotions.  If I could actually use the information to help myself, all the better.  I was warned that the beginning was a bit slow and hard to get through, so I struggled through it, expecting it to get easier to read.  It didn't.  It's been sitting by my bed for months with the bookmark at page 104 and I'm really sorry because I'm sure that the contents are useful and interesting, but I just can't get past that page 104.  I normally refuse to leave a book half unread, but this just has to be an exception because every time I pick it up I fall asleep within 3 or 4 pages.  I agree with some of the previous reviewers that there is way too much emphasis on the actual workings of the meetings.  I feel like I'm watching a video of it, as every minimal thing is described in incredible detail.  But I wanted to read this book to understand the views and conclusions of the group, not to become an expert on the tea breaks they had.  Also, I felt lost as the scientific tests they had previously carried out were explained in such detail, I ended up having to skim over some sections.  This may be a great resource for those who have great patience and/or a scientific background, but too much for a regular Joe like me 
 After 6 months of use, the handle holder on the lid came off due to fatigue at welding joints. Since the other pieces also uses spot welding at the handle, I'm fearful for my safety and contacted Sitram Customer Support. This is their response   "While we have the ability to authorize replacement for the defective products that have handles coming off, we are unable to satisfy a request to credit other product that has not shown signs of being defective"   In otherwords, they're not surprised the product is defective and I'm not the only one complaining. If I'm stupid enough to buy a whole set, then I'll have to return each item as it falls apart. Too bad if the defective will maim me in the process.   Stay away from this defective and inferior product if you value your health and safety.   BTW, I contacted Amazon Customer Service and they agreed to accept the return. Love Amazon.  
 I thought the book would inspire me into healthy eating as much as the cover does.  little did I know that Carol is a MODEL and ACTRESS.  duh.  ok.  so it's not the raw food.  even when she ate candy, scotch and drank coffee she still (and i quote) "managed to keep up appearances".  ok?  so WHAT is the point of the cover??!  The book itself is unsatisfying, poorly written.  I find it rambling, cutesy yet unervingly technical at times, fluffy and self absorbed!  written in a patronizing tone it is as if she is addressing fat people and convincing them to eat raw and becoming repetatively angry at their (at times ignorant) questions.  If the author thinks their questions are so DUMB then WHY publish them - the same question THREE TIMES no less!  The one about "don't you get hungry eating just SALAD?".  UGH!  There is also NO credibility here.  She eats white bread, white pasta, white sugar, table salt one day then the next day quits those and happens upon a raw food diet.  OF COURSE her health will improve.  it will improve even if she still eats cooked food and eliminate white bread, white pasta, white sugar, coffee and scotch. there is NO SAY in here that credits raw to be the one to owe.  I mean, even when she ate coffee and scotch every DAY she still managed to be in magazine covers.  obviously, it's NOT the raw food 
 I used the repair feature one time and the unit would never turn on again and the disc I did do the repair on still didn't work.  Don't waste your money on this 
  This film has been mentioned in the same breath as so called "hood films" such as Clockers and Menace 2 Society, I had heard it was set in a NYCHA housing project and so I bought it partly for visual research purposes for an upcoming final year degree project which may or may not involve architectural renderings of a NYCHA housing project, but partly because I enjoyed other apparently similar films.   This film is absolute lightweight all the way. It may be "important", and back in '91 it may have been hardcore, gritty, convincing, etc. etc. but watching it in 2005 it packs a weak punch.   It is not set in a NYCHA project, and the street lifestyle that is tackled so superbly for example in Menace is never even approached here. This movie instead chooses to go the route of King of New York, but Wesley Snipes is no Frank White. New Jack was instead set around an apartment building called "The Carter", which were we not told it was a crackden looked like a pricey, well-kept appartment block that totally lacked any edge or atmosphere whatsoever.   The film utilised several times a helicopter fly-over of the area surrounding "The Carter", in much the same vein the beginning of Menace panned over Watts and Jordan Downs; but where Menace succeeded in capturing a palpable atmosphere of feral ghetto landscape and an implied simmering below the surface with its fly-over scene, New Jack's left you wondering why the film's director bothered setting the movie in such an unintimidating place, and then bothered to show it to you by means of a helicpter fly-over.   Snipes and his crew look like a wannabe Run DMC, never convincing, never gritty, none of the darker more subtle aspects of criminality of the nature apparently portrayed in this film are ever even brushed upon. Snipes' Toni Montana impressions made me cringe, however good they may have been. This film was not tuned in, it simply didn't appear to have its feet on the ground.   Ice T was plain annoying with his pseudo-racist, "street" policeman with the most annoying voice, accent and lines I have come across. He acted out every simple-minded stereotype of the character he was trying to portray, all the while smug and convinced of his own worth. Every scene with him in it annoyed me immensely.   The only characters who seemed to do a stand-up job were Chris Rock's crack-head, and Mario Van Peebles' detective.   New Jack is a lightweight crime drama that fails to deliver on most of its chosen frontiers, there are other films out there that tackle New Jack's chosen subjects in immeasurably superior ways.   
 I bought this item as a holiday gift. It is a very beautiful piece and is artisitcally designed well. When we went to set it in its stand, however, the lip of the neck brushed the wire frame and chipped! I was shocked that it broke so easily. It's possible that they connected at just the right point and it was mere coincidence, but I am not getting another one to find out. Beware 
 I wonder how many men and women have been scared away from even thinking about a relationship with God because of the inane prattle of Pat Robertson.  As a Christian myself, Robertson embarrasses me.  His blood and thunder god has the temperament of a five year old child and about as much judgement.  Robertson continually dishes out his poison all the while blinking with his eyes half closed, his mouth twitching, and this idiotic **** eating grin.  If he didn't influence so many, he would just be another sad joke.  But unfortunately people listen to this man talk of praying away hurricanes, how Hurricane Katrina and 9/11 occured because of God's wrath, how the citizens of Dover, Pa. can't expect God's help because they turned their backs on God and on and on and on.  He opens his mouth and dumb falls out.  Please don't judge all Chrsitians on the basis of people like this.  We aren't all ignorant and we don't all hate everyone who disagrees with us 
 After only a few uses, my trimmer simply stopped working! No, it wasn't the batteries. And I was not within the allotted time frame for returning the defective item, so I am simply "out" my money and I am not happy about it! I should be able to receive some kind of compensation for my time and money 
 I never really saw what was so great about Iggy Pop.  He was hyper and screamed.  so what?  So does my two year old son 
 I just purchased the new one :(. I put it upstairs in the bonus room and bought another just like this. I gave the old away when I purchased the new one. Shame on me. This thing makes tea waaayyy better than the new ones. The new ones wouldn't come close to melting all the ice. Therefore the first bit if tea was okay the last was way watered down.. This one rocks !! 
  This story is about a misbehaving six-year-old who colors on the walls, throws temper tantrums, makes faces, destroys her dolls, and for all intensive purposes acts like a two-year-old. She is extremely spoiled (and after waking up her nanny announces that "Nanny has to get up and pamper me and spoil me for a while). Parents might object to the condescending way she treats adults and her distain for education. (She has a private tutor who is "boring boring boring" who she doesn't listen to "very often.") Throughout the story she repeatedly says "Oh my Lord!" which some parents may find objectionable. The story is presented in a grammatically incorrect, stream-of-consciousness writing style from Eloise herself, that, if you are able to suffer through it, leaves you craving a well-written story about a much nicer (and more coherent) child than Eloise.     
 This book does not explain how an Imam from England can say,  'If Allah tells me to condemn terrorism, I will condemn terrorism"!  This book does not explain that while not all Muslims are terrorist, most terrorist are Muslims!  This book truly is trying to lull Americans into a false since of Security.  
 I have to agree with the other one-star reviewer Jim-Jim. Of all of my Jazz Books, and I have quite a few of them, I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would praise this book. There is nothing in it but disembodied scale fragments, patterns and note combinations (which the author calls "cells"), which are totally useless on their own melodically, and the author offers no suggestions for left hand voicings or detailed harmonizations under them. Oh yes, he also includes some bafflingly minuscule snippets on "theory" which don't come close to explaining in any organic way the mysteries and complexities of beautiful jazz understanding. Almost nothing in the book "sounds" good on its own, and I would never mistake any of these naked, unharmonized note combinations as "vocabulary" if I heard them in, say, a jazz club. The best I could do with this book is play the pages as exercises, an experience which was joyless and mind-numbing. The title is completely misleading. P.S. I NEVER want to hear any of the people "play jazz" who have awarded this book with 5 stars if they have in any way used this book as a primary reference for their playing 
 Well, if giving up your favourite things such as alcohol, coffee, elevators, taxis, newspapers, cell phone, shopping, dining out, television, cursing, chocolate and multitasking seems difficult for you, think again. Carlomagno has written just the book to entice you to try giving up some of your favourite things - at least one thing for a month. In a whole year she managed to give up all the above, each for a month. Lessons to be learnt: she grew wiser in terms of giving street directions because she had to rely on buses. She grew to like tea when she gave up coffee. In giving up elevators, she felt more energetic when she walked up the stairs.   I do wish that Carlomagno had stuck to the "sacrifices" that she made. I mean, she only gave up each of the items for a month and then reverted back. Sure, cell phone and newspapers might be difficult things to give up forever, but what about television and cursing and elevators and even coffee. Surely these can be eliminated totally if she sets her mind on it? I mean if caffineated coffee is bad for health, one could switch to green tea (which is touted as a healthier choice) henceforth after having broken the need for coffee for a month.  Well, flaws notwithstanding, the items picked by Carlomagno could be jumpstarts for readers to follow. The pace of Carlomagno's book is fast and an easy read. I like the book size (7.4 x 6.5 x 0.8 inches).  Should you buy it? Probably not. Borrow it if you could. I know for sure our local library stocks this book. 
 I was disappointed with this purchase. The cover is so cute, but the only design that is really interesting is the pink and green hat with the pom poms. That just isn't enough to warrant buying the whole book 
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 In 1991, Twista came out and got into Guinness, then in 1993 B.O.N.E. released Faces of Death and then the classic EP "Creepin on ah come up" in 1994. I honestly think Twista and other chitown rappers didnt steal Bone's style because even though theyre both fast, bone harmonizes their flow, while twista harshly spits his. This album is a clear cut example of how Three 6 Mafia used Bone's style to come up. This album was originally released in 1995 and each of the members of the group sound almost identical to the Bone members. If you want my opinion, Three 6 used Bone's style to come up in the business and that is evidenced through the fact that in Three 6 today. "Stay Fly" and "Poppin My Collar" sound nothing like "Live By Yo Rep", all being good songs. Look at that to comparison with Bone ,, "East 1999" and "Thuggish Ruggish Bone" sound very similar to Bone's appearances in "Ridin", "Spit Yo Game", "Dont Forget About Us", and their solo work 
 It's a long read, the characters are boring, and the ending makes no sense at all.  It is neither funny nor thrilling. It's just plain dull 
 It does not like rapid changes in temperature.  When the sun stops hitting it in the cold weather it takes an hour before the screen comes back.   All of that is moot, because now after only 2 weeks of operation it only works indoors, though it is a mere 45 degrees outside. Sent it back 
 We bought this for our son last Christmas and it was broken within 3 weeks!!! This is unacceptable for any toy, much less one I paid $20 for!! The page in the middle that switches modes just stopped working for no reason whatsoever. My son has NEVER broken a toy and we own many Fisher Price and LeapFrog toys. I tried to exchange it many many times and the store never got it back in stock. I tried to contact Vtech via email and had my email returned as undeliverable. It was a cute idea, especially how the song "voice" changes when you touch a different animal, but with the safety issue with the pig and how hard it is for little ones to move the sheep, it's just not worth it. We bought another Vtech toy last Christmas as well (Sing & Discover Piano) and it broke within 2 months. I will never buy another Vtech toy!! There are much better toys out there. Don't waste your money! 
 I thought the art had a certain charm, and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read, I think it's quite nice.  (Too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.)  The moment the child starts to read, though--better hide it quick, because...  Unfortunately, the book reads like a condensed Communist Manifesto for kids (as others have noted), or a Socialist agenda primer.  I don't know for sure that's what Marcus Pfister had as an aim, and I'm not going to speculate on his politics.  He has three kids and may raise them as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat.  Yes, I suppose sharing is nice.  Certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in America, we get paid for that (charity is voluntary, not coerced).  Furthermore, stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily BETTER, just unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it?  Is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)?  Is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad?  Almost seems like it, at least to me.  Furthermore, there's an overtone of "only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth," which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever I've seen.  Of course, people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me, but that won't make them right.  (The two stars, if you must know, are for the art. 
 The characters are shallow and static.  The ringworld is kind of cool, but, unlike many reviewers here, I need my books to have interesting and complex characters.  The plot is also very thin.  In fact, everything in this book is just some cheap window dressing on the ringworld.  
 This coffee pot was excellent when I first purchased it. The coffee tasted wonderful and it was always hot and brewed quickly. It hasn't been a year yet and the coffee takes for ever to brew, there are grounds in the brewed coffee and worst of all the coffee pours out all over the counter. Rarely do you get a whole pot of  coffee. It still tastes great but what a mess. It is also very hard to fill the water resevoir with water. Cleaning is a chore.  This is my third cusinart coffee pot in 5 years and I will never buy another one from them. They look great work well at first but do not last. I thought I just had bad coffee pot karma but I think its the company. Time to find another brand 
 SAVE YOUR MONEY. HAVE TRIED DUAL CEREAL DISPENSER FROM JC PENNY'S. AGAIN SAVE YOUR MONEY. CRUSH,JAM,FLEMSY,MESSY, ETC. . NOT KID FRIENDLY !! NOT WORTH THE MONEY. USE TUPPERWARE UNTIL SOMEONE MAKES THIS PRODUCT PROPERLY.. 
 I bought this because many claimed how quite it was, especially on low setting. Well the fan is quite on the low setting because it barely moves. On the higher settings the entire thing vibrates making a sound you can hear on the floor below, even when it is placed on a carpeted floor. I am very disappointed with this humidifier, so much so that I might just throw it away and get a different one. I plan on never buying Vornado again. 
 This was my first Deaver book...and my last.  The suspense factor was "ok", but the sections on scuba were ridiculous.  A diver (with only 25 logged Caribbean clear-water dives) goes into a new NY/NJ wreck, alone (no dive buddy), on a single tank.  And the Coast Guard approves this dive...laughable.  Then once in the wreck, the diver goes down a dumbwaiter passageway measuring 2' by 2', without taking off any gear!!!    You might ask why I point this out...The above was 2 chapters, not just some passing reference, a very material piece of the story.  If this one section [which I know something about] is that outlandish, what does that say for the other sections that I'm not as informed about.  Complete Science Fiction!!!  You are better off reading tea leaves than this book. 
 Bought this one a few months ago. Soon after started having problems, trying to add songs to the hard drive, it says that the HD is full, even though I only have 1 song on the HD. THen it just completely shut off and I cant turn it on now. Piece of junk, dont buy this! 
 While Black and Blue does bring to light and make the readers aware of the depths and secrets involved in spousal abuse, it is rather difficult to identify with, like, or even feel anything for the protagonist.    Black and Blue explores the life of an abused woman who has attempted to disappear with her son in order to escape her abuser husband.  First of all, the book seems to me like a Lifetime Movie, almost cheesy if you will.  Half of the things the main character does, you are screaming at her in your head to not do them.  She is almost like the dumb girl in every horror movie, who runs up the stairs instead of out the door.    I found all of the characters in the book seem to have much more depth than the protagonist.  While I was rooting for her, it was because she was the victim, not because I actually liked or understood her.  She seemed weak, in that she really didn't do much of anything to help herself or her situation, either everyone else did everything for her, or things just kind of happened. Yes, it took a lot of guts to make that first phone call that was necessary in order for her to leave her husband, however, that was the only thing she ever really did for herself (pick up the phone).  Everything else was done for her, mostly without her knowledge.  She was doing something that was so hard to do, she should have felt like a strong woman to me, but she didn't not in the least and I attribute my feelings to poor character development and the actions as well as the non-actions of the main character.   One thing that annoyed me was the constant memory descriptions or flashbacks.  While they were integral to the story, they came at the oddest moments.  Sometimes it took you a few seconds to figure out if she was speaking her memory to someone else, if it was actually happening in real time, or it was all in her head.  In the middle of a conversation with someone she would suddenly reel into a 2 or more page memory in her head and then when the memory was over she would go right back into the conversation.  This left me having to go back a few pages to recall what the real-time conversation was even about.    Overall, the basics of the plot were interesting, as were some of the characters in the book.  The book does make one aware of the dangers of often hidden spousal abuse; however, it was not captivating.  I will not buy, recommend or read this book again. 
 Overall, this would have been a pretty good Johnny Cash compilation.  Unfortunately, Sony chose to censor a line from "Boy Named Sue" with a loud bleep.  It ruins the song, and in my opinion taints the entire release.  I bought this CD to hear Cash, not a butchered hack-job by Sony's lawyers 
 Again, another interesting pop-corn director that makes a couple of good low budget films and when Hollywood gives to him a free hand (or not so much) things go wrong.  Is not funny, Wilson and Stiller aren't interesting enough and the 70's isn't a good decade to crave for.  With this kind of films, is useful to listen to American critics, they know more about their own culture than us 
 The book arrived quickly and appeared to be in new condition.  However, as I began to read it I ran into a problem.  It appears there was an issue when binding the book.  Pages 86 to 102 and missing completely and pages 201 to 235 are printed twice.   I received excellent custoemr service from AMAZON when I reported the problem and a replacement book arrived within 5 days of my compliant.  Repalcement book is also new and was boudn crooectly with all pages appearing only once 
 This is the last and final time I will be reviewing this movie.  The movie begins as Izzy Daniels, a boxer, is dancing in the streets. (Can we some Lionel Richie in the background?) He comes across Mary and her friends double-dutching where he says that it looks pretty easy, and all that jazz.  He watches them at a competition, and realizes it looks like fun, so he joins there team, but Mary is hesitant to let him join. Finally, he joins.  But doesn't tell his father. Ah, yes, the plot thickens.  Overall, an "okay" movie, but not worth buying if you ask me. It's pretty much like every other Disney Channel movie out there. Person is good at one thing, then does something to disappoint someone else, big happy ending.  Personally, the music was just okay. But everybody wants to be a singer. I mean, Keke Palmer needs to STEP AWAY from the microphone.  Corbin does his best at producing an upbeat track, "Push It To The Limit", and ends up making a fairly-decent song, but not great.  Worth watching on Disney Channel when they play it, if you can spare an hour and a half. 
 Problems have been reported in the Teacher's Guide for the 1997 Edition of this textbook. .. 
 This is junk. Since the end of the Soviet Union, it appears that "swarthy" Arabs are the new evil which the - guess what? - handsome, dedicated, sensitive-because-his-true love-died, intelligent, military-minded white guy has to single-handedly defeat and, of course, save Western Civilization from the narrow, evil-yes, "evil" again-tentacles of Islamic terrorism. And, as is the case these days in this whole genre of trashy spy novels, "Islamic" MEANS "terrorist."  And our Golden Boy does what we expect him to. This is so trashy and predictable, I feel Ludlum ought to pay us all back. Don't waste your time. 
 This book shows the dichotomy that exists in modern-day America between the cutthroat environment that supposedly exists in the private sector, and the easy-does-it culture fostered within the public sphere of schools, government agencies, etc...  The book makes the case that America's youth are basically coddled K-12, and end up playing catch-up during and after college when working in the free-market culture of the private sector.    These conclusions have been elaborated on before in other publications, and are only true to a certain degree.  For example, the author gives examples of how Americans working in the private sector excel and achieve like citizens of no other country.  The author forgets to mention that nearly all the successful industries in this country, especially those that have gone to spawn copycats in other countries, were and are all supported and protected by government largess.  For example, automobiles would only be rich men's toys today if it were not for all those roads and parking lots built by taxpayers.  Another example, US agriculture would not have survived the Great Depression and become the world's leader in food produce if not for the introduction of farm subsidies, government-funded agricultural research, government-operated satellites and weather stations to monitor the weather, and other government programs that directly or indirectly help farmers.  These and other established, successful private industries would be nowhere without some "coddling" from US taxpayers.  Even if we dismiss the previous points, I believe the author has only shown half the picture; specifically, the author does not fully examine the question of why "coddling" occurs in schools and students are not prepared for the competition of the "real world".  The answer to this question connects the dichotomy so well illustrated by the author.  Specifically, American adults are so busy surviving in the private sector that they have less time and effort to raise their kids to be good competitors themselves.  For example, the character traits that makes for successful businesses: willingness of employees to relocate, works long hours, toeing the company line, etc..., are exactly the worse traits to follow when trying to raise kids well.   Raising kids well means living in stable communities with low turnover - this means minimal relocation of employees by businesses.   Raising kids well means spending time with them, and not spending long hours at work.   Raising kids well means teaching them to stand up for what they believe in, not what their peers (boss, coworkers, etc...) want them to do.    This then is what the author has totally missed out on in this book; an explanation of how the dichotomy between private sphere hard-nosed competetion, and public sphere cushion jobs came about.  Because of this omission, this book is merely commentary and observation, and lacks insightful thought 
 I love The Great Gatsby, so I have high standards when it comes to its films. The 1974 version was adequate at best. It looks very dated now-- like it was the 1970s trying to be in the 1920s. Not very modern in the filmmaking sense.   This production is just bad. The acting is basically horrid, especially on Mira Sorvino's part. Sorvino was badly miscast as Daisy. She didn't have the right voice, look, or mannerisms that the WASP-y Daisy Buchanan has. In fact, Sorvino is Italian. So why on earth is she playing a 20s socialite WASP? She really butchered the role. Toby Stephens, while not exactly the definitive Gatsby, doesn't do a bad job. He's got the stellar smile down pat and he's very suave. I don't think it was a case of bad acting with Stephens, I just think he concentrated too much on Gatsby's phoniness and not enough on the redeeming qualities in the character. And despite what people say, I thought Paul Rudd was good as Carraway. At least he did a fine job of narrating.   The cinematography and all that wasn't bad, but not enough research went into the costumes and makeup. Daisy's hair was not period-appropriate at all. Hello, bob and finger waves! Where are you? And her clothing wasn't right either.     So, if you want to see a decent production of The Great American Novel watch the 1974 version, but if you want to see a definitive production of The Great Gatsby, you'll have to keep waiting... 
 this book was designed to sell! The knowledge contained in this book was general and unpractical. No thought or knowledge went inot writing this  book. You can insert any business into the title......"How to Start  & Manage a ______ Business" ....simply put...not helpful 
 I had such high hopes for this book. Thank heaven, someone gave it to me for it is not worth the money to buy it. I liked neither the heroine nor especially the hero. Dead characters, no charisma. I plugged thru to the end and was relieved to finish it. Get it from the library 
 I had high hopes for this book. I was sorely disappointed. The author kept going on and on with his theories about why the Roman Empire collapsed. Every time I thought he was about to get around to some IRISH history, he went back to Rome, or some other culture. I can understand setting the stage, but this was ridiculous. Halfway through, I gave up, skimmed the rest of the book, and decided it wasn't worth the time 
 I really did not find anything original or humorous in the story.  There is a bratty, demanding girl who insists that her grandfather row across the river to buy her socks. When she stubbornly refuses to wash them, people and animals react in an exaggerated manner until her friends take the matter into their hands.  The reviews sounded great but I probably will donate this book to the library.  No it isn't a princess story but it could still have someone with redeeming qualities. 
 I hated this movie. It was unrealistic and unbelievable. Also, Julia Roberts is a horrible actress and more than slightly resembles an opossum. 
 ...and put their own little spin on it!  Going to split this into 2 reviews, one based on it from the book, the other just based on the movie in general.  The book "The Tommyknockers" is set in the town of Haven, Maine, where strange thing's start to happen to the townspeople after Bobbie Anderson find's a large, mysterious object in the woods behind her farm.  Curious, she starts digging it up, and with each shovel full of removed dirt, open's up a terrifying and life-altering experience for all those involved.  1)  The movie based on the Stephen King Novel:  2 stars  I watched the movie after reading the book (my own personal rule) and though at time's felt like they were true to the book, was often left going "huh?" at the changes that were implemented.  Certain thing's are left out, while replaced by hollywood's cheap imagination.  The missing teeth as well as the batteries and inventions running off them never really hit home, and though the book had a multitude of characters who had important part's of the story, we see some simply vanish and never make it to the mini-series.  Perhaps the Tommyknockers got to them first! Since it was a miniseries and ran over 2 hours, there was no reason to chop and hack this thing up and replace it with alternate scenarios and a different ending.  I was disappointed to see how Hilly was found, as well as the fate of Gard and the ship, and Marge's ultimate destiny comes out differently as well.    2)  The movie in general, without comparing it to the book: 3 stars  Margie Helgenberger and Jimmy Smit's do a very good part cast as Bobbie and Gard.  The overall pace of the mini-series roll's along well, and the production and directing is okay.  The sound is good and set's the mysterious mood that the town of Haven is faced with.  Disappearing people, mysterious inventions run off batteries, and a mob like atmosphere are all displayed as we wait to see who the tommyknockers are, and what exactly they want with the townspeople of Haven.  An excellent cast overall considering the many various character's that had to be portrayed in the story 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 After reading most of the Dragonlance books, I finally bought this trilogy. I wasn't expecting much, and I didn't get it. It's a bad sign when your book has 15 pages left with no resolution in sight. Or when you have a "slideshow" telling what happened to the characters because you ran out of space. How many times did these paperdoll characters get burned, scarred, run through and mortally wounded just to get revived by the healer? How many times did we get detailed descriptions of their new outfits but not real personalities? Despite the good idea of dragon overlords, how come no one deals with the problem of food? At the rate they eat, Ansalon should have no people or livestock left. But that, along with so many plot points, is just part of the mystery. Maybe that mystery is why five dragons let a band of humanoids poke, prod and wound them, then let them leave. It's too bad Jean Rabe had to introduce unbeatable, unkillable monsters and found them more fascinating than the characters we had to read about for three books 
 I was very excited to get this product.  It scans well, files well, is very sexy and promising.  Then I decided to Search for a few files based on my Keywords.  Oooops!  It won't search!! If you don't know already, PaperPort offers you only one free tech support call.  After that it's $20 a pop.  The rather surly technician I reached had me re-install my program.  Okay, but it still wouldn't search.  Then he told me to un-install Windows Service Pack 2.  Uh uh, no way.  Nada.  That's when I asked for a refund. I bought MyCab for $40.  Tech support is marvelous, within one hour over the Internet.  The only thing it doesn't do is scan within the program, but then I can do that, can't I? AK Napa, C 
 Why is feminism dead?  Because mentally ill types like Dworkin and her partner in crime Catherine MacKinnon became the face of the movement in the 1980s and 1990s.  Hard to believe a bunch of spineless male academics ever let themselves be bullied by psychotic females spouting this kind of hate-ridden tripe.  "Hate speech" was always OK with the hypocritical Dworkin and MacKinnon as long as it was directed at people *they* supposedly hated (like heterosexual men).  Thank God Camille Paglia came along and blew these two away with reason and logic they couldn't refute.  Andrea Dworkin = human dung.   
 Because most everybody wanted to stick a dirty sock down Eric Burdon's mouth, that's why.  The Animals were great (a later incarnation included Andy Summers), but Burdon just absolutely alienated anyone with an IQ of greater than "10" by his flat vocals and his embarrassingly poor Jagger imitation 
 As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.  
 In this book Mr Poole portrays Eastern armies as masters of camouflage, deception, and close combat that will surely defeat US forces if we don't radically change the way we train and fight. This in the face of the outrageous casualties suffered by Eastern armies in the Pacific Theater of WWII, in Korea and in Vietnam. We failed to reach our political objectives in Korea and Vietnam, but it was NOT because we didn't kill enough of the enemy.    He argues that US troops rely too heavily on firepower and technology. I also wish the woodcraft skills in our infantry were higher. That said, in my opinion he makes a lot of  exaggerated claims about amazingly skilled Eastern soldiers. Many of those claims were footnoted to books on ninjitsu, but the most outrageous ones were footnoted to "Memorandum for record, H. John Poole." I didn't find footnotes to any actual military history sources or war memoirs regarding Eastern troops' skills. I'm sure Eastern armies, just like ours, have soldiers that were hunters prior to enlisting and learned some great woodcraft that way. Again, if the Eastern privates are so awesomely skilled, how do we explain their enormous loss of life every time they fought US troops?   Given the above, I take strong exception to the book's subtitle. A US private's TRUE "best chance for survival" lies in mastering his Common Task Training skills; keeping his physical fitness, marksmanship, and weapon and equipment maintenance second to none; and in being an effective team player within his squad. I didn't see anything in this book that would really help a US private (or any other rank) survive.    Bookworm soldiers such as myself would be much better served reading from the list published by the Chief of Staff of the Army. The list has titles for everyone from privates to generals and does include books that are critical of US military performance. This book is a waste of time and money 
 In Morag Joss' FUNERAL MUSIC, the main character is Sara Selkirk, a famous cellist recuperating in Bath, England after a nervous breakdown in the middle of a concert. After making a small scale return to playing at a charity event, Sara discovers a dead body...the body of a man she never met.   The central plot of FUNERAL MUSIC revolves around Sara's emotional recovery...the circumstances of her breakdown are reveealed late, although many readers will probably figure it out early on. Meanwhile, Sara's involvement in the murder case is tangiental, driven by the fact that people tell her things almost constantly.....especially the hunky police offer whose marriage is on the rocks and loves the cello.   There almost no suspense in FUNERAL MUSIC, and much of the book is taken up with descriptions of interior design or food preparation......I'm not quite sure where this series can go 
 i don't understand why anyone would want to buy these sets when you can buy all the seasons for just a little more money!!!! 
 I had great hopes for this book, as I do for anything that continues the work of Jane Austen, but I was very disappointed. I did not find Ms. Tennant's Elizabeth at all like the original. She had no spirit! And Darcy was even more autocratic and uncommunicative than in the original. Moreso, the book did not continue based upon details given in the original in many particulars - Mrs. Collins discovers a first pregnancy that had already been revealed in the ending chapters of Pride & Prejudice, and Mr. Bennett is dead, when in the original, he delights in popping in unexpectedly at Pemberly. Better research and a better understanding of the original stories and character are required in my opinion. Not worth the read. The writing style, although consistent with the original, makes too much of reiterating certain phrases. Ms. Austen did not do this herself in her works. I have read many, many Pride & Prejudice continuances, and I found this one weak. I have enjoyed the Carrie Brebis books, and I liked the series of three (I'm sorry I can't recall the author) that viewed the story from Darcy's point of view. 
 The only reason anyone should have to buy this pathetic anime, is if they enjoy very old anime who's only audience was buidt upon nipple and panty shots.  Do not buy this unless you have seen it already and liked it 
 Let me first say that I couldn't put down the first two books of this series.  They were well written, tightly plotted, and the story moved at a rapid pace that made me stay up far later than I should have more than once.  However, the last three books in the series bogged down horribly in irrelevant side-stories.  I kept waiting for something to happen.  I ended up skimming 300 pages of this book, looking for a relevant plotline.  Worst of all, the moment toward which the series had been building for so long, the confrontation between the main protagonist and main antagonist, NEVER HAPPENED!  Instead, the authors betrayed their readers by avoiding that confrontation in what was an obvious ploy to provide material for future books.  Sherwood Smith's excellent collaboration with Andre Norton in the Solar Queen series drew me into this series.  However, after this disappointing experience, I don't plan on trusting this author again 
 I think it was important for Amber Frey to get her story out, and I think she is a victim in all of this, but this is a shoddy attempt to profit off of the whole situation 
 I hate to belittle an obviously successful songwriter (although I've never heard of any of the songs listed on her website--and I know A LOT of songs), but the examples in the book are awful! Either she wrote the examples in the time it took to punch the keys on the keyboard or the book was designed for songwriters who have no desire of hearing their songs on the radio. Some of the songs, like "Kismet," are so bad/old-fashioned/non-universal that I laughed when I read the words. I'm not saying that I could write better songs than she could (at least not now), but based on all the good things I read on the back flap in the bookstore, I expected a lot more than this. If you're looking to write lyrics period, this book might be acceptable for you. But if you want to write songs for radio, I highly recommend "6 Steps To Songwriting Success" by Jason Blume instead! 
 Like other uses have pointed out, the music are NOT conducted by John Williams nor performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, and they do NOT sound the same with the music from the movies.  You are still getting a nice collection of music, but for the REAL John Willims music, you gotta buy the original soundtracks.  These products just don't measure up to the authenticity of the glorious works by John Williams 
 I borrowed this book from library having noticed "definitive" in the title. I reserved it as well.Being a big fan of Paul Simon I was expecting a well written and researched biography What a waste of $1 and my time. I will admit the early chapters were interesting, but when you get to Paul's solo career everything goes pear shaped. Important chapters in Paul's life seem to be squashed into one paragraph. And I wanted to learn about more about Paul's classic songs such as 'Duncan'. I am not going to learn anything in a couple of sentences. Useless. I would not recommend this to anybody 
 After the first 11 books, that were laced with black comedy and inopportune situations handled and aligned in a way to make sense, the 12th books somehow leaves the reader gasping for more and ends with a flat note. I can, however, find cognizance with the moral of the story that sometimes people you think you are close to, fail you with their "nobleness" or lack of guts! That you have to find strength in yourself to fight your own wars and that a family has an important part to play when you're struggling through your live. I think the gist of the story is that that the three children find succor in each other - almost a live force driven by love, that protects them and eventually helps to extricate them from impossible situations! 
 I found this 'interactive' cd to be quite pedestrian. The scenarios or vignettes that were supposed to show sales interactions were pretty cheesy and not in the least bit helpful.  The GUI was not well-designed and the whole experience was less than effective 
 I think I made myself pretty clear with the title.  But, if further explanation is necessary: Theroux is exactly what he claims to abhor about tourists & travelers.  He's an egotistical, self-centered racist who has paddled aimlessly around the world in lieu of actually parenting the children he chose to have and be a husband to his original wife.  The only reason I kept reading is bc I was traveling to many of the places about which he wrote.  Additionally, I lived in HI and was interested in what he had to say about it.  Ultimately I was embarrassed that I had to share Oahu with him.  And if he mentioned one more time about his claim that scads of Japanese brides throwing themselves off hotel balconies...I mean really.  If you're looking for a fact based book about Oceania, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a self-indulgent POS about a man's traveling mid-life crisis, you can have my copy.  Thank God I only wasted a quarter on it 
 I listened to the audio version of this book. While most of the things said in this book may be true, it appears a bit biased. In addition to facts, the author uses some adjectives which show her personal dislike of the famous couple.  In the end, I had an impression that this book grew out of author's frustration upon Mark Rich pardon. Many chapters are dedicated to that case.  A disproportionately large portion of the book is devoted to two topics: pardon and donations. At one point the audio book spends a large amount of time only listing names of who donated what item. It goes on and on and on with names that make no sense and contribute nothing much to the story. That could have been moved to the appendix to keep the flow going.  I was hoping to find details about mischievious behavior by Clinton staff during the last days. There was no mention of that 
 Maybe you thought Yumi was the main character, but the one to be most admired is certainly Cass.  She is the strong one, the stable one, the woman I most liked.  Yumi turns out to be a pretty crappy mother, among her many other faults.  It was an okay book, but predictable.  Although I saw it coming, the ending did turn out to my liking. Momoko was another undervalued jewel.  In the scheme of likeable women, Yumi (for me) came in a distant third 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 What a horrific movie to gear towards children.  It is extremely violent and just plain creepy!  The scene where the dog is hanging from a chain and drowning in water was so WRONG.  I wish I could put 0 stars for this one.  Do not waste your money on this one 
 Rarely have so many pages been used to convey so little information. This is a very superficial treatment of many subjects. This book offers very little in making language interesting.  I bought this book after reading a review in the New York Times which made it sound interesting. After looking through this book, I suspect the reviewer was put up to writing a favorable review. If you think this book might be interesting, borrow a copy and inspect it before buying. 
 This book is getting mixed reviews. It seems like friends of the author say its great. Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date. This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date. Things change, but sloppy research is always out of style 
 I was disappointed. Even if you do want a book about Soros' personal life, the presentation was boring. It was doubly boring for me because I was hoping to learn something about his financial history. There is Shamefully little of that in there. Even the 1/3 of the book entitled "Making Money" was not about that. There are enough uncritical biographies written about his personal life. When is someone going to write a critical account of his financial history? That is the interesting part. There is the story. Too much about his philanthropy 
 I didn't like how the author has chosen to label the character's anxiety as his "autism".  This book conveys the message that his autism is the label of his bad feelings or his feelings that are out of control.  I wish the author had chosen a different word to describe the character's feelings, such as anger, impatience, or anxiety.  Instead, they are labeled as his "autism".  It's an uphill battle to fight against the negative impressions of autism.  My message to my kids is that their autism is part of what makes them interesting (and it's true).  
 I thought I would love this, but it just takes too much time and energy.  Germs can go through cloth once it is wet from saliva.  Then this material has been rubbed all over the cart and then I put it in my car etc.  I just don't see the difference in that and not using it.  My hands touch it, baby's hands touch it etc.  I have enough to keep track of with a bag, baby, wallet, cell phone....I just dont have enough to keep track of a giagantic piece of material!  My grocery store has those sanitary wipes outside the store by the carts and I wipe down the handle bar....that is far more effective against germs.  You are better off buying a $3 thing of purel hand cleaner than this bulky, ineffective cloth 
 Okay maybe I a lying, there was one funny part where some characters talk about their sleeping habits, but otherwise this book was not entertaining.  I picked it up thinking it was going to be a light-hearted, fun novel, and it was not.  It was depressing and annoying.  I really did not like the main character and everytime she took her engagement ring because they had a fight, I wanted to scream.  I guess this book was just not what I expected, I only finished it because I can't stop books in the middle.  On a good note it is a quick read, even if it is like torture 
 This book has an entertaining approach and is very readable.  However I was very distressed at the authors' errors, really inexcusable given the intent of the book.  For example, (pg9) in the sentence, "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone," the author states that "Who is without sin" is a restrictive clause describing "who."  Since when can a clause modify part of itself?  The clause modifies the word "him."  And on the next page, the author states that the gerund "playing" is the object of the verb phrase "disapproved of."  When, may I ask, did "of" turn into a verb?  In the example sentence,"The conductor disapproved of the tuba player's chewing betel nut during the concert," the gerund "chewing" is actually the object of the preposition "of." And the author should know better.   On pg 80, in a section on proper word choice, "exhort" is misspelled as "exort." On page 195 he confuses a compound predicate with a dependent clause. Pointing out such errors may be nit-picking, but in a book about grammar, the grammar jolly well better be correct 
 The Title of this CD threw me off; the description and the first review didn't help either.  The primary reason for buying this CD was the song "You Are My Sister", but this version is a duet with someone that can't sing. I can't tell which CD has a version of the song as seen on Letterman. Disappointing 
 As many reviewers have indicated, this book is not nearly as good as Patterson's earlier works.  Is it possible Patterson now employs a ghost writer?  For people who enjoy thrillers, his first few books are fun. Don't bother with recent ones, though 
 Hi there  Coming from an Oracle and SQL Server world, not alot changes really between the enterprise class DBMSs, many of the same best practice principals apply.  Unfortunatly, this book falls WELL short of the mark.  The book only glances over tuning, with no thorough look into the startup parameters for example.  Indexing, stats collection etc is also very poor and there are no discussions on internals (to save us all from reading the code!).    The replication chapter was OK, but I would seriosly suggest that the modelled replication model for load balancing is a really bad idea and a maintenance/cost nightmare.  For a prod dba from Oracle or SQL, you will be very disappointed 
 This latest translation of the Chinese Taoist Classic is a dry and lifeless specimen, not surprising from a man whose translation of the I Ching was praised for "having no truck with 'timeless wisdom.'" (back cover blurb).  This volume's claim to fame, beyond its slim and attractive appearance, is the complete translation of Wang Bi, a 23 year old commentator from 3rd century CE China.  To determine whether this translation is for you, you should know that Wang Bi had a strong inclination toward political interpretation, a proclivity probably due to the "high official status and prestige" of his family and their role in government and politics [p. 9], a trend furthered by his great-uncle's "Treatise on Keeping One's Person Safe"-which begins by making government secure [p. 10].  (Now there's a Chinese virtue, eh?)  Consider also Wang Bi's answer as to why Confucius never spoke of nothingness while Lao Tzu spoke of it incessantly (as the Mother of the Ten Thousand Things etc.):  "The Sage [Confucius] embodied nothingness so he also knew that it could not be explained in words....Master Lao...constantly discussed nothingness...for what he said about it always fell short [p. 12]."   Now if you believe that someone who could say that actually knew anything firsthand about the Tao, then this book is for you.  And if you are interested in Wang Bi, see Ellen Chen's superb translation/commentary which puts it in perspective.  Otherwise, this is a book on Te-social virtue-where the scholarship is impeccable and the feeling is weak.  And that's the Way it is 
 I thought this movie was absolutely awful.It is one of the worst movie's I have seen in quite a while.You keep waiting for the movie to get interesting, but it never does.I don't recommend this movie, especially not to a guy, he would be bored out of his mind by this one 
 This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo 
 To endure life's inevitable roadblocks, we have to strive not for perfection, but contentment, and miraculously all the pain will go away -- for a while.  What he calls "curing" I call "coping with."  There is no cure for the hardships we all encounter along the way -- becoming a hermit is even worse, as you dwell on what's wrong.  Ultimately, all pain goes through a "receiving center" in the brain, and seratonin blocks the perception of pain and keeps it from "centralizing" in the nervous system.  In his diatribute to the ability to be pain-free, he refers a lot to his former book, BRAIN LONGEVITY, on which he collaborated with the same journalist who has written for several medical magazines.  He uses many "deficits" for possible causes of chronic pain, but specifically names seratonin as the worst, depending on one's pain tolerance threshold.  He says that women suffer more from chronic pain due to hormonal changes, that two-thirds of all patients at pain clinics are women with migraines.  Back pain is three times more prevelant in women, according to this doctor, and chronic muscle pain is ten times more common among the female sex.  All pain signals ultimately land in the brain, where they trigger thought, emotions, memories, and a complex array of biochemical events aimed at protecting your body from further harm.  With chronic pain, the alarm continues to shriek uselessly long after the physical danger has passed.   Seratonin is the body's single best pain-fighter, more important even than endorphins.  Seratonin deficit is a major culprit.  He emphasizes that suffering is one reaction to pain, but not the only possible reaction -- that it is possible to experience pain without suffering from it.  He admits that all lives contain some pain but, when you can experience it without suffering, "your chronic, disabling pain, for all practical purposes will be 'cured'."  Pain is the most common reason people go to doctors.  Dr. Scott Fishman, president of the American Academy of Pain Management feels, "We've wandered from the basic philosophy in medicine, where you cure what you can but always treat suffering, to being focused only on curing."  In the section about arthritis, he confirms that the side effects pain medications present are worse than the problem they are supposed to relieve.  One example is plain aspirin which, he says destroys the cartilage, the "padding" which keeps bones from rubbing together.  This is the most common type called osteoarthritis.  It is thought that eighty percent have this type by the age of fifty, progressing as age does.  It involves hands, spine, hips, knees and feet (primarily in overweight people), and goes back to the cavemen.  Exercise therapy is touted as a natural substitute for medicine, but I know first hand that this type can cause more pain.  Rheumatoid is a disorder or malfunction of the immune system with more inflammation of the joints.  He says that this is most often in women between 25 and 50, with no known cure.  In this type, you have to learn to "conquer" as opposed to "cure."  He really only stresses what we all know, you just have to live with pain at varying times and in varying intensities.  If you try to follow all of his suggestions, not only would you spend all your time trying to locate and consume numerous herbal supplements and expensive foods, but your money, too.  Mort Crim once remarked, "forgiving someone can't change the past but it can transform the future."  Dr. Khalsa tried out this intensive program at the University of Arizona. I think he must have had all female subjects. It is not recommended to use this as a substitute for medical care, as needed, only as some suppositions.  More research is needed, I feel, and I wonder how long his program lasted.  I feel that traditional Pain Management, similar to what I had at Vanderbilt in Nashville is better -- but there is NO cure for pain.  That's an illusion 
 I was forced to suffer through this rubbish in a college class. This book is merely propaganda packaged under a thin dust jacket of objectivity. The arguments are weak and contrived. Said seems to be just another appologetic for Islamic barbarism. The very premise for the book seems irrelevant -unfair potrayal of Islam in the western press. It's the very typical "don't believe what you see, believe what I say" sort of drivel that only appeals to mindless drones in dusty lands 
 I loved the first Xenosaga. Then, this arrived. Episode 2 isen't a bad game in terms of the story, the intro is absolutely DYNAMITE. Then you get into a battle. Now, if you like tactical stuff, this is a good game for you. But if you're trying to fight your way through a hoard of enemies to get to a save point in record timing, I say save your money. Gone is the amazingly well-done battle system in the first episode. In its place stands a completely out-of-nowhere new way of battling that takes 15 minutes to get rid of a couple of easy enemies( the easy ones in this game have around 2000 Hps). Ridiculous, but that's not all. The enemies have weak "zones" that depend of the height of the attack that you input.The zones are A,B and C, A being the highest. Triangle=C, square=B and Circle=A -SOMETIMES-. See what I mean? It's completely screwed-up and you have to become deeply addicted to the game to understand its full potential. And if       that wasn't enough, they changed the voice actors too. Kos-Mos's  voice sounds more like an operator than a robot's and Momo sounds like a brat. At least, chaos' voice has improved. I'd prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this. I just hope Namco comes out with a better sequel, otherwise spend your moey on something else (like Shadow Hearts, for example).     
 I bought this on the recomendation of someone concerning a technical question I had on Video signalling over SDI. It turned out to have about 1 paragraph on the subject, and didnt come close to being able to answer my question.  Having worked on Computers for around 20 years including writing and debugging mainframe assembler code, as well as many a day spent searching though page after page of hexadecimal, I am no stranger to bits and bites, and large libraries of thousands of technical reference manuals.  I have 3 problems with this book.  1) The title is deceiving. A more accurate title would be "Primer for decoder/encoder design" or "Video Signaling Reference Guide".  2) It cetainly does no "Demystifying". I expected a book that was structured and had a flow to it (as any educational book should) but found it to be written with absolutely NO PERSONALITY (like a reference book), and using terms at the start that then only actually get explained half way through the book!  3) There are so many tables and figures (overkill IMHO used too much to fill pages rather than explain anything well) with very little descriptions, and no keys to the diagrams. 90% of them also seem to be referred to by text many pages away from the actual graphics, which is just bad book design.  I am sure that the author really knows his stuff, and the book is full of very useful refrence information for designers, but for someone looking for an educational book on Video, you should look elsewhere, unless you have a fulltime engineer to sit with you as you read the book.  I can only recomend this as a reference book for those who already have a very good grounding in this field, or to be used in conjuction with another higher level book written by someone with much better educational skills.  
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 While an interesting work and worth reading, it is not nearly the biography that Blair Jackson's "Garcia" is.  Many aspects of Jerry's life are somewhat polished up it seems.  Not that gory expose is  desirable, but still I was left feeling that perhaps the book had a  censored feel to it.  This is just an opinion.  Read Jackson's book, then  "Dark Star", for a much more complete and well rounded view of  Jerry's life 
 First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few "novels" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. "Pop lit" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book 
 After ordering the shoes I realised that the carriage was almost as much as the shoes, I tried but was unable to cancel the order, on recieving the shoes in perfect condition they were far too small and certainly not the size stated I cannot return them as I would have to pay more again in carriage, I have written to both the company and to Amazon but have not yet had a reply.  Due to the fact I have forgotton my password i have been unable to e-mail you about this althoughI have tried on numerous occasions.  I hope someone may be able to hel 
 Well he fixed all his bugs. He thinks he is in spiral model of life cycle publishing, Good Grief!  Added few more projects which are poorly written, especially project www redirection - chapter 19. When I am paying 60 bucks, I expect some quality content. Oho, well maybe my expectations are more because he is targettng the student community. They are not paying you to read your book but they will download of some p2p file sharing network. We pay so I think I have every right to demand. The difference is obvious when a book is written by academic professor versus a professional software developer with tons of experience.  I would suggest, stick to Richard Stevens, unless you are in that Texas school where he teaches 
 While the author rehashes some basic business writing theory, she consistently fails to follow her own rules: - The text is full of fluff - The style is flippant instead of useful - The lecture style puts you to sleep   There are much better books on the subject. A textbook approach is necessary for this subject. Not this dopey-run-on-crap.  
 Reading the first chapter was the only time I actually enjoyed this book. Everything went downhill afterwards, when I realized this was just a retelling of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is a well-told classic, timeless, raw, and beautiful. Here On Earth, however, is just a poor rendition, very contrived, no spontaneity whatsoever.  The almost-complete cast of characters in Wuthering Heights is present in Here On Earth. I don't remember the names of the characters in Here On Earth but I remember their counterparts pretty well. There's your modern-day version of Catherine Earnshaw, there's the modern-day counterpart of her brother Hindley. Then there's the counterpart of Heathcliff! Surprise! Surprise! A foundling with a dark and ominous character! And then there are the neighbors: the counterpart of Edgar Linton (whom Catherine's counterpart marries), and the counterpart of Isabella Linton (whom the counterpart of Heathcliff marries). And then there's the counterpart of Catherine Jr (Catherine-counterpart and Edgar-counterpart's daughter), who falls in love with cousin counterpart of Hareton (son of Hindley's counterpart). There's also Nelly Dean's counterpart, and Linton Linton's counterpart, but that's all I'm going to say. Those of you who've read and loved Wuthering Heights, you know the rest.  It's a sad thing that this is the first Alice Hoffman novel I've read. I'm now inclined to ignore the rest of her novels. Maybe. Or I might be open to her other novels if I've finished reading all the other books I really wanted to read first 
 The pictures of rare Hawaiian plants and animals in "Remains of a Rainbow" are pretty.  Pretty uninformative. And the text is largely nonsense. The tipoff is "rich volcanic soil." When you see that in a book about Hawaiian natural history, you know right away that the author made no effort to learn his subject. Just a few paragraphs away, we run into a rhapsody about the ancient Hawaiians' respect for the "unity and balance of the natural world." Large, slow, tasty birds excepted, of course. The text by photographers David Liitschwager and Susan Middleton (assisted by Maui poet W.S. Merwin in an ill-informed introduction) is the verbal equivalent of kudzu -- an exotic, boring growth that smothers the interesting natural stuff underneath. Green goo. It is understandable why the sponsors of "Remains" -- Environmental Defense and the National Geographic Society -- pander this way. It is not so easy to sell Hawaii's endangered plants and animals on their merits. After all,  you and I are not likely ever to encounter most of them. Which raises a question: If none of us is going to meet them except in the pages of a book, why bother to preserve them in nature? A small herb that was never known to exist until three or four years ago, and which was down to maybe five or 10 individuals then, is not going to alter the islands' ecosystem if it disappears.  One answer to that question is the last word in this book, taken from the writings of the late Maui biologist Wayne Gagne: "We are in pursuit of environmental quality, an ethical stance where our native biota is concerned, and for accepting each natural ecosystem on the planet for what it is . . . each a unique result of multifaceted ecological processes, past, present and continuing." Fine words, but Liittschwager, Middleton and their sponsors  obviously do not believe they can sell them. So instead of marketing Hawaii for what it is -- a unique place -- they peddle the ecological situation here, which is grim enough in fact, as part of a crisis "of declining biodiversity worldwide." This is the "sixth great extinction" argument, one of those  resilient popular ideas for which there is little evidence. People holding such views can find themselves in paradoxical situations. Middleton, who blows the tin horn of mass extinctions louder than Liittschwager, writes about how after 15 years of working with endangered species, none she had encountered had yet gone extinct. Until Clermontia peleana. But it turns out that while Clermontia peleana, a Big Island plant, probably is extinct in the wild, it is not yet quite extinct from the Earth. Middleton does not seem to find any contradiction in simultaneous belief that the world is in the midst of the biggest extinction crisis in 65 million years and the fact that even a specialist in endangered species has yet to encounter one that passed on. Considering that outsiders Liittschwager and Middleton had the cooperation of dozens of Hawaii's best biologists, they could easily have done better. For one thing -- and this is another tipoff that the writers have not done their homework -- if they had listened to local experts, they would not have made such a big deal of Hawaii's biological diversity. To call islands with no amphibians, no reptiles, no pines and no ants diverse is perverse. Instead of revealing and reveling in Hawaii's strange status -- its untypical ecological situation makes it the greatest natural laboratory of evolution -- Liitschwager and Middleton went for the picturesque and shallow. Their pictures are gorgeous but don't tell much. They mostly were shot against solid backgrounds and display only a part  of the organism. There is little hint of how each species functions within its community. The misleading text of Liittschwager and Middleton is somewhat corrected by thumbnail descriptions of the 142 species illustrated, which were written by local authorities and are reliable. "Remains of a Rainbow" represents the work of years, with the combined support for publishing from Environmental Defense, the National Tropical Botanical Garden and The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii; along with the on-the-ground help of NTBG, Maui Land & Pineapple Co. and other public-spirited groups. In an afterword, David Wilcove, senior ecologist of Environmental Defense, writes that the survival of species in desperate straits will rely on "above all, public education." "Remains of a Rainbow" is so far from contributing to public education that readers will end up knowing less about Hawaii after reading the book than they did before.    
 I am currently taking an undergraduate course on Cather, and I hoped that this book would provide some insight into a side of her not covered in the course. However, I found the book full of jargon which rendered it  incomprehensible to me. Perhaps if you are already initiated into the world  of "queer studies" you will find it interesting, but I don't  recommend it for a casual reader 
 This book does not offer much more than the Sun J2EE Tutorial online does and that is free. I have worked through the first two weeks, and I have decided to shelve it. The book starts strong with the JNDI. There are plenty of code listings for you to type in and try with good explanations on naming, binding, and lookup. After this the book is nothing more than a rehash of the Sun Online tutorial with a different larger example application. The application is complete. You don't do anything but read about the design and pertinent Java technologies that are being used for that particular part of the application. Then you are given instructions on how to deploy the current working piece of the application on the J2EE RI, and run sample clients against it - chapter after chapter of the same thing. Though this type of learning by reading some one else code with explanations seems to be enjoyed by some. I side with Ivor Horton. Programming is not a spectator sport. You learn by doing. Having the reader build the application and participate in the process would have made for a better learning experience of a complex topic 
 I thought this book was all over the place, but maybe that was because I only read it before I went to bed. There were flashbacks and flash forwards and I thought the author was trying to be overly clever.  None of the characters were really that interesting to me.  It was sad that Jean didn't really have any friends and to be so old and know practically no one.  Wow!  I hope I don't end up like that when I am her age.  How could a married couple go on for 30 or 40 years and never tell each other such basic things.  What a miserable life!  I am glad this book was short or I would have put it down sooner.  I am not sure if I would read any of her other books.  I do like the fact that it is set in North Carolina, which takes me back home.  I thought this was a boring book with little moral value for me.  It is probably because I couldn't relate to the characters because I just don't live my life in total isolation.  Others might get more out of it that have life experiences that mirror these characters 
 My son was very disappointed when he received this item.  It looks nothing like the picture.  The picture shows a whole container of viewers and you receive one baby blue view with a swirly sticker instead of the eye as in the picture.  I believe this is false advertising, and everyone should be aware of this.  I wanted to give it half a star, but it was not available 
 Nietzsche, who started all this, may or may not have been the deepest thinker since Socrates, but he was a stylistic virtuoso. Deleuze and Guattari, on the other hand, were founder members of a postmodern cult whose watchword is: obscurity = profundity. But while some profound things may be ineluctably obscure, by no means all obscure things are profound.  This book, which runs to 250 pages scarcely burdened by a coherently expressed thought, is in line for the prestigious prize, the Golden Merde de Taureau. It contains, along with much else, the authors' mature lucubrations on the foundations of calculus, which have greatly impressed readers who flunked high-school math. Others maintain that these passages are not about mathematics at all, just as the passages about science are not about science, and they may be right. What, if anything, it is about is anyone's guess, and many have speculated, some to their own satisfaction. One thing we can be sure of, because the authors tell us: they are creating concepts. This important work should not be undertaken by those in whom unfortunate defects of education have left a residual respect for language and joined-up thought.  The book was a bestseller in France - possibly the most unread bestseller since a 'A Brief History of Time', but for different reasons 
 The video is rather slow and will be difficult to capture the attention of a Grade 12 audience due to the subtitles.  A translated version would have been much better I feel but I will try it this semester with my students and see how it goes 
 Somehow they managed to get beautiful fresh-faced Kate Beckinsdale and lather enough make-up on her to make her a candidate for Madame Tussaud's wax museum. A bit to aggressive with the hair curling thingie didn't help either. No lead had enough "quiet" time in which to establish a character...they had the depth of Playstation 3 people. All the CG monster's just moved too fast. The thing that bothered me the most...1/3 of the film occurs in "dark-o-vision"...it's so dark you can barely discern what is happening. Combine that with the hyper active fight scenes and rapid fire editing...and whole scenes occur that don't involve us simply cause we are confused on what is going on. I would think there could be some frightining scenes, maybe some tension and dread, heck it's got the grand trio of monsters...nope, not here. We've seen enough how movies are made specials that we are bored by CG cartoons. The "face in the sky" ending was embarressing. 
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 This review concerns the original 1936 edition and the revised 1974 edition which is slightly different from the original but basically tells the same story.  Nancy meets a young Indian boy (named Coya in the original, Rishi in the revised) who lives with a circus.  The boy is being mistreated by a man named Rai who claims to be the boy's father, but Nancy doubts this claim.  Nancy saves Rai from an elephant and to show his thanks he gives Nancy an ivory, elephant charm which he says can protect the wearer from harm.  Coya/Rishi runs away from the circus and Rai and the Drews take him in.  Later, Rai changes his mind and wants the charm back and he will do anything to get both the charm and Coya/Rishi.  Also figuring into this "mystery" are a strange woman and a bizarre house out in the middle of the woods.  The house, apparently, has no floor, but it does have a secret passage and a bunch of swings and trapezes hanging from the ceiling.  This book was just plain awful!!  The mystery, what there is of one, is stupid and boring.  The house serves absolutely no purpose other than to use up pages and it makes no sense.  Who would build a house like that out in the middle of nowhere?  The strange woman in the book is more annoying than anything and comes off as too scatterbrained and weak-minded to be the great criminal mastermind that the plot requires her to be.  The book has little in the way of action or suspence.  This book is just bad, bad, bad!  Take my advice and don't read it 
 This book tells the story of the last Kingpriest of Istar which means it had to contradict every other book in the entire series. It drove me crazy so I couldn't finish it 
 I was very disappointed by the lack of useful information in this book. Nothing was presented that you couldn't find with a simple key word search of the internet. I had hoped for useful suggestions, interesting insight, maybe some tips for making the experience more enjoyable. Instead it read like a glossary of the toys. If you already know what hardware there is available this book won't be much help. It didn't even have suggestions about which toy might be superior for which purpose. I was hoping for a more comprehensive treatment of the act and how it could enhance the bond between my lover and myself. This book was more like an quick overview stretched out for 100 pages. There was great potential in this often unexplored topic but the book decided not to delve into it 
 I got a copy of this book a few years back as a Christmas gift, and the title and cover immediately put me off (and I'm really not the type that judges a book by it's cover).  It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel.  Big mistake on my part.  The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral.  It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book.  But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym.  Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring.  Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring 
 If you're a trusting sort, read the title of this review and stop--don't spend another moment thinking about this film. But if you must know why you should not waste 95 minutes of your life on it, as I did, read on.  Garcon Stupide has delusions of grandeur, as does its main character, a young gay lad who seeks his thrills in anonymous sexual encounters and believes he's a good photographer because he takes pictures with the built-in camera of his cellular phone.  Said lad (Loic, played by first-timer Philippe Chatagny) is pretty enough to warrant the numerous extended closeups of his face that comprise half the film--the picture on the box does not do his enchanting smile justice--but the pablum he speaks is by turns silly, nonsensical, and stupid. The plot, such as it is, takes its cue from the dialogue, and in the end it feels like a series of utterly random events have carried us to an implausible conclusion.  What ought to make the film at least a little bit palatable for a gay audience--the gritty sex in which Loic engages quite freely during the film's first half--is filmed inelegantly and, in one uninspired split-screen scene, juxtaposed with the workings of factory machinery. This is an odd place for the director to make a play at realism in a tale otherwise so unconstrained by it!  If you're looking for a good gay coming-of-age story, try Dorian Blues. You may not get to see the main character naked, but at least you'll respect yourself in the morning 
 The writer tries to generalize from the experience of four great statesmen in war times to make a conclusion that politicians should tell generals what to do!   I think this book is political biased.   Say if I was to reverse the equation and generalize from the experience of four great generals to make a conclusion that generals should tell statesmen what to do! Would the writer agree with me?   I could also write a few essays where democratic leaders just left his military leaders to do their job and the military leaders did a very good job eg  prime minister Eshkol  of Israel in the six day war and the Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Indian Gandhi in December 1971 in the Indian Pakistan war. Is the conclusion now that statesmen should stay out of the actual war.   Also I should stress is that most people are not *great*. To try to generalize from a few great men is a very dangerous experience. Great men by their nature are gifted and unusual. 
 Not enough basic recipes and not enough information.  I returned this title, it just didn't appeal to me.  If you want some more intricate recipes and some great basic convection oven info - try "The Best Convection Oven Cookbook".  Personally, I'd like to see some one write a book with roasting times, chocolate chip cookie recipes and more of the basics 
 I found How to Start a Magazine by James Kobak difficult to read and somewhat depressing.  The promises on the cover, in my humble opinion, we never fulfilled and the textbook-style format was flat.  I felt as if, rather than a telling me "how to" he was telling me all the reasons "not to."  He also came from only one perspective--that of a large scale, national publication.  My goal is to build a local business-builder magazine.  Therefore, much of the information was irrelevant for me.  Based on the cover promises, I thought I'd found the ideal book for my needs.  It didn't deliver.  
 Although Healy seems to be in support of technology in education, she chooses to present only the worst case scenarios in her book and takes a very pessimistic view of educational technology.  She visits several  schools, both in low and high economic areas, and seems to find all of the  worst examples of computers being used with students.  For example, she  observes a group of students using 2 computers to do writing, and tells  only of those who appear to be wasting time, not of those who are being  successful.  She criticizes the activity and calls it a waste of time.  At  the same time, she quotes teachers saying things like "Isn't it great  what they can do with the computer?" which then makes the teacher look  like she doesn't know what is going on.   	It is true that often times  parents and teachers don't use computers to their fullest potential, but  spending an entire book pointing out all of the faults is not the way to  change people's ways.  The problem essentially falls on the software  manufacturers who see a profitable market in "edutainment"  software. To Healy's credit, she gives several different suggestions for  parents when they are buying software for their children at home and  suggests ways to use the techonolgy as a tool, not as a substitute for the  television.   	Instead of pointing out everything that is wrong with  technology in schools, Healy and others like her would be better served  looking for what is right and working to make these good practices  available to those who need it most 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 It is tough to appreciate the spirit and enthusiasm that these tunes usually convey. Good song selection, but it sounds like this was recorded by a 30 piece high school band in their band room. I highly recommend going directly to your favorite college web site and purchasing their own arrangement and recording. No band can play any other school's song with the same emotion given to their own fight song 
 Overall, the book covers relevant M&A material but it's difficult to read. Coming from a finance background, I was looking for a reference book to be used at work. There are other books that are more user-friendly. Recommendation: get Applied Mergers & Acquisitions from Wiley Finance instead; same topics but a pleasure to read. 
 I teach drama/theater in a low income public school. I bought the book because my school has very few resources and I thought this might be useful. As it turned out the book was hardly used during my first year teaching. My biggest problem with this book is that it is not very user friendly for a teacher who just wants to add some fun to a class but not a complex game. In other words the book needs to make the games simpler so the kids can pick them up faster and have more fun. This might not be problem for teachers in high school as your students might be more mature and able to handle more complex games. But for middle school teachers tread lightly. Also if you have a bunch of behavior problems in your class then forgot about it. In my experience I found the worse the behavior the better they were at spoiling fun classroom games. Be warned 
 I was disappointed with Climbing Mount Improbable. My assessment is not based on a particular worldview, but rather on the quality of the book. As evidenced by the many emotive reviews posted on this site, the theory of evolution is under attack on many fronts. I have followed this debate and read works from both sides of the issue.    In purchasing Climbing Mount Improbable, I was seeking a book that could address recent challenges and clearly articulate the case for the current theory of evolution (random mutation and natural selection). I have an interest in zoology and found some of the author's descriptions in this area interesting and well stated. From my perspective, however, he does not address the issue of evolution in a direct or convincing manner - I felt that Dawkins overused simplistic analogies and "just so stories" that though at times clever did not address the issue at hand.  From a stylistic perspective the author comes across as a bit too intolerant and self-aggrandizing for my tastes. At times Dawkins digressed into what verged on a polemic against those that questioned his views or assumptions. For instance, the author poked some fun at Fred Hoyle for raising questions regarding the improbability of Neo-Darwinian Theory. Granted, Mr. Hoyle is a physicist (Nobel Prize winner)and evolution is not his area of specialization. However, many of the recent challenges to evolution are also outside of Dawkins' area of expertise and makes him susceptible to his own type of ridicule. I generally find these types of personal attacks unwarranted and distasteful.   I apologize to author's fans, but I do not recommend this book. Kenneth Miller's Finding Darwin's God makes the case for evolution in a much clearer and convincing manner.  Darwin on Trial by Johnson is also interesting for an opposing perspective as are David Berlinski's comments on Dawkin's work (available on line).  
 Reality Bites seemed fresh when it was first released, giving voice to a generation - with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of "X" - that was overeducated, underemployed, plagued by the flashy, trashy commercialism of MTV, and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college.    It was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass, cruel arena of materialism can be tough, providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth - the very stuff of real movies.  Instead we have a swan dive into a Pizza Hut commercial held together by a plot so shop-worn it would have been considered exhausted in 1930.  Winona Ryder is winning as Lelaina, but one can only imagine the SATs of football players at a college where she is valedictorian.  Her "documentary" is appallingly narcissistic, reflecting the characteristic Gen X notion that - "if it's about me, it's art, and it's important."  Ethan Hawke does an excellent job as Troy, the very archetype of self-satisfied, supercilious entitlement.  We are expected to root for him, but it's hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus.  Stiller, who directed - a talented fellow almost impossible to look at - plays Michael, the "anti-Troy."  Smooth, successful, and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of Gen X culture - if culture is the right word - he's an executive at an MTV-ish corporation.  That he improves Lelaina's preposterous "documentary," rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity, is the film's dirty little secret.  Viewers surprised by who wins Lelaina's hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and Liberace was gay.  Indeed, when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie.  Janeane Garofalo is outstanding as always, and John Mahoney shines as the TV morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact, a bastard.  His performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film - or on TV - than the rest of this film put together.  In fact, reality is great, this picture would have benefited from some 
 I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.    The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.  I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time.  This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there 
 A quite pathetic rehash of worn out diagrams and dogma. Also very poor paper used 
 won't ship to hawaii. hawaii is a state in the united states.  some seem to think it is a forign country. damn fools! 
 I like Sam Elliott movies very much. This one was BAD!!! A lot of Bad Language. Every couple of words. It should be rated R. I think instead of PG 
 I am [...] the unit because it will not run a slideshow from a media card. 16 Mb of internal memory for a slideshow is just not enough! Read on!  If you call they will tell you that the slideshow from cards is not possible because on Page 13 refers to excluding pictures from the slideshow on only on internal memory. This is not a definitive statement that slideshow is not possible from a card only that excluding individual pictures from a card is not possible. (because the unit is not capable of writing to a media card.)   Looking further on p13 it states: "Choosing slideshow frequency Note: This function applies to photos stored on all media." Page 27 in FAQ states: "2) Q: Can I switch between different slideshows photos by using different memory cards? A: Yes. When you connect your memory card to PhotoFrame(tm), it will slideshow photos stored on that specific card." Finally, the Quick start guide FAQ states: "Q Can I switch between different slideshow photos by using different memory cards? A Yes, Digital Photo frame will slideshow photos stored in the card or camera currently connected."   Clearly the three references I provide indicate that the DPF can operate slideshows from a media card. IN REALITY SLIDESHOWS FROM MEDIA CARDS DOES NOT WORK. Philips how about a firmware upgrade?  I bought this thing to allow my mother who is not computer savvy and lives far away to look at family pictures. I was planning on sending preloaded cards to her. All she would have to do is insert the card and turn it on. (Mom is 75 and this is as technical as she gets..). Do not buy this DPF for older, none computer savvy people. Since media card can not be used, you have to use the internal memory for slideshows. The internal 16Mb memory can hold about 70 pictures - that's it. It is also unclear the maximum size a file can be. I believe the internal memory converts the file to a DPF friendly format and renames the file when copying from a media card. (How is Mom going to tell me which picture to print if the name changed?) Why have media card slots if they are useless? Internal memory is way too small! DO NOT BUY and save yourself the hassle. 
 Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.  There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted.  The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's.  The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.  In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex 
 I desperately need boot shapers, but these are very difficult to use. The problem is in the design. I have to squeeze them together very hard to get them to go into the boot at all, and they always spring apart at the bottom once they are in the boot, so I can't get them in all the way. They are better than nothing, but only just barely. I have other boot shapers, all of which are designed better than these 
 I have a long-standing interest in cultural issues in healthcare and so I eagerly bought this book. It's in the 3rd edition--I figured it must be good.  It is appalling! You can turn to almost any page and find a portayal of a person from a minority culture that is presented in such a way that it makes the person sound like an idiot. Not just immigrant and ethnic minority patients--immigrant medical professionals, too.   In addition, she does not modify her gross generalizations by saying, "HIGHLY OBSERVANT Muslims" or "LESS-ACCULTURATED Mexicans" or even "SOME Chinese." No, for Galanti, she generalizes about Muslims, Mexicans and Chinese, with no gradations according to people's country of origin and degrees of orthodoxy (e.g. Muslims), generations in this country, fluency in English, etc.  I am afraid this volume will perpetuate stereotypes. Yes, it may be "fun reading" for people who know nothing about the topic, but they will end up with a view of "how weird those people are!" rather than either any true cultural understanding or a better sense of how to adapt their own practice to meet their patients' needs.  i have never returned a book in my life--this is going to be the first.   For alternative choices on related topics consider: Culture & Clinical Care (Lipson & Dibble) Ethnicity & Family THerapy (McGoldrick) Child Abuse & Culture: Working with diverse families (Fontes) The spirit Catches You and YOu Fall Down (Fadiman).  Stay away from this one 
 Papadimitriou's book is a classic, but many of my students find it difficult. This book is clearly not written by Papadimitriou. When I saw this book (Cram101) I didn't know what to expect, but hoped for some sort of easy presentation of similar material. This book has nothing to do with Papadimitriou's Computational Complexity. Half the pages are intentionally blank. The other half have definitions of terms (most repeated over and over) that have nothing or virtually nothing to do with the topic. For example "mean" is defined (poorly) 17 times and "sets" is defined (poorly) 12 times 
 Never seen the band live but this CD is a big disappointment. The sound is a low budget version of Santana / Los Lonely Boys. The songs are lame and way too commercial.  Hope their next album turns out to be better (a lot) 
 Like some of the other reviewers, this was pretty much the first book I ever read on the subject, but later as I studied more, I discovered that Wilson has so filled this book with bias and irrelevancy as to make it virtually useless.  It's only saving grace is that so many players in the game are namechecked that the interested student will at least know where to look.  There is also the final chapter, "Glimpses", which might have made a good small book on its own, with its discussion of "Faculty X", that I rather liked.  On the whole though, I can't say that the brand new edition is worth it--you'd be better off purchasing this one from an Amazon Seller 
 I think Dr. Laura should title her next book "The Secret of My Success: Stupid People."   Julie Townsend, Metairie, L 
 i had never heard of anne tyler before i started seeing this book's  hardcover edition all over town. four years later i saw the book again at my local library and decided to pick it up (the demure nape had always intruiged me). what a mistake. i found it redundant, to the point where at certain spots, after i had set the book down, i was positive i had picked it up 10, 15, 40 pages earlier at a passage i'd already read. i soon realized, indeed, i was on the correct page, it was just that a nearly-identical scene was again playing itself out on the page.   how many times does the reader have to experience Rebecca's regret, nasty step (and full) daughters, her doddering senior citizen charge or squeemishness at the touch of her once-true-love? it was the same disappointing non-event over and over.   and i thought this book was also a shameful depiction of one woman's sorry, horrible life. it felt as though she was a mute doormat. i suppose it could be considered a "real" story but Rebecca's lot in life seems to be romanticised. it's not romantic or wistful or nostalgic, it's just sad. 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 Gay Talese's work on his family's journey from Italy to America is an involved tale that delves into a difficult historical period for both the United States and Italy.  Revolution, social upheaval, racism, and war  color Talese's story from start to finish.  These themes give the tale a  characteristically depressing bent which tends to ramble in certain places.   In addition, there is a decided social message which the author appears to  be trying to put forth during the entire story.  These perspectives, and  those on Italian history, should be viewed in the context of  interpretations of an Italian American writer and not be taken as those of  traditional native Italian scholars.  Still, the book is in a bold attempt  at telling the story of one family's struggle, on both sides of the  Atlantic, during the social upheaval of the twentieth century 
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 I enjoyed Dance upon the Air, Nell was a believable and easy to relaate to character, Mia is self-possessed and interesting with a little bit of mystique thrown in.  Ripley on the otherhand, I found simply irritating, not so much bitchy as umbelievabley whinny.   I understand that Nora Roberts was most likely trying to write her as the 'angry' the one who needed to learn control over her rage, but she came across as mostly whiney and childish.   Not an enjoyable read 
 TO is the man!  He really stands out in the top of his game.  What an arrogant jackass, the person who downtalks TO.  He's the man!  Jake, the reviewer, makes a good point about TO's love for Nathan Lane.  Very surprising, but very true!  MC White said:  It sucked, but read it anyway 
 This movie is stupid beyond words. I watched a half hour of it and COULD NOT watch any more I was so lost and BORED. Makes no sense, talks about creepy gross and disgusting things, is boring and stupid!! Don't waste time on this dull as dust film 
 I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end. 
 There are NO English Subtitles as it says there are in the DVD Features. I would think subtitles would be a pretty standard feature in DVD movies these days - Artisan Entertainment is just lazy I guess...    
 First of all the subtitle has been wrongly interpreted.  Some creationists have decided to use this title to expose Darwin as a racists.  He may be, I have not read "The Descent of Man" yet.  The origin of species talks very little of man.  It is a book of observations and study.  It concentrates on how plant life, has by selection, brought forth all the species we see today.  The survival of the fittest through millions of years by gradual change.  Darwin covers his beloved pigeons in depth.  I agree with him that all the different types of pigeons we see today probably came from one ancestor of the pigeon.  This is called variation of kind.  We see this in just about every living creature and flora.  The problem arises when the next step is taken, the rise of one species turning into another (reptile to bird).  Throughout the book Darwin does admit to this fact, but he still maintains that it must be, with much difficulty.   There is no doubt there is a tremendous amount of work that went into his book.  It is a difficult read.  I would rather have read the dictionary.  One does need to know his enemy.  Darwin is not the originator of "evolution."  There are many who came before him, since the dawn of time.  He was influenced by numerous men of his time, some being more radical.  Darwin was nothing new, he just maid it "hip."  What he started has turned into the secular humanism the world had adopted.  I don't think he meant for this disease to spread like it has.  From his writings I understand him as an agnostic, but doubtful.  I believed he struggled with the possibly of a deist.  It is safe to say it was his only ambition till his dying day to prove "evolution" as proof of our existence.  What of the missing fossil record?, he new they would be found.  He was a confusing man.   150 years later and there still has been no intermediate fossils found to prove the case.  In fact we are discovering more that validates creation. 
 I skimmed John Gray's "Practical Miracles for Mars & Venus," but couldn't stomach the hype.  The first 150 pages are about the power of positive thinking and of belief in miracles.  (Gray claims that the world has matured to the point that miracles are now available to anyone, at any time.  Democracy and religious tolerance are two of the enabling changes.)  Gray then sketches some simple techniques for physical and emotional healing: eat right; breath deeply; use a Chi Gong exercise to "recharge healing energy" and "decharge excess or negative energy" (or stress and negative thoughts); imagine that people have treated you better than they actually did; write yourself a letter expressing your frustrations; cultivate gratitude, confidence, joy, etc.; envision the world you want; believe in yourself and your power to heal.  I gather that the techniques are more completely described in Gray's "How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have."  "Practical Miracles" reads like an ad for Gray's seminars, or like a verbatim trancript of a stage presentation.  (On page 239 he says "Now I have written twelve bestsellers and tend to be a speed writer. ... After many years of developing my thoughts, it takes me only a few months to write them down and create a book.")  Positive thinking is all well and good, but the seminar must be more inspiring than the book 
 The book is not about technical analysis of stocks.  It's about a way of analyzing socio-economic trends.  The way it was presented and also other books I read by the same author misleaded me 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 this backpack was very uncomfortable. the inserts are stiff. it doesn't represent canon quality (I hope) 
 The book is violently anti-Semitic. More importantly for an informed reader, it is so inaccurate that it is useless for anybody but historians exploring the investigation of Romanov murders. Wilton's hatred of Jews clouded his mind to the extent that he was unable to establish even the most basic facts concerning the case, although he had ample opportunity to interview a significant number of key witnesses and had access to evidence now lost. Wilton was fired from London's "Times" for being unreliable, in 1919 the British High Commission wanted him recalled and Foreign Office often branded him a liar and an embarrassment 
 This book is probably useful for learning what missionaries are up to out there in the non-Christian world.  However, it does not stop to ask whether they SHOULD be out there.  And of course, from a cross-cultural and anthropological point of view, they should not.  It is arrogant, ethnocentric, and culturally destructive to spread a culturally-relative and almost certainly false ideology and belief system where it is not needed or wanted.  Missionaries have been the source of much of the world's trouble, and they still are.  But more essentially, the whole idea of missionazation is judgmental and intolerant. Why do those people need you and your "belief"?  How would you like it if they were missionizing you!  Oh, but you think your religion is true!  Well, so do they!  It seems all missionaries and those they missionize have in common is a lack of cultural understanding.  If we recognized religion as the relative (different in different places, not "true" in any meaningful way) and damaging, irrational thing it is, we would stop supporting it and start supporting real efforts that help people in real ways 
 I am using this text in a class on Contemporary Latin American societies. The book is easy to read and has great strenghts such as Price's Geographic Preface. Unfortunately, two key chapters such as the Economies of Latin America and Patterns of Race, Ethnicity, Class and Nationalism are superficial and weak to the point that I find myself making up these shorcomings with a bundle of extra readings.  1. It does not take a bleeding heart Liberal to agree with the importance of the Lost Decade and the decline of ISI. These themes are developed in three pages, filled with economic gargon and lacking a clear theoretical framework. In the end, the authors seem to suggest that governments' mismanagement of the economy is the main (if not the only) factor explaining the collapse of major Latin American economies. It took the wisdom of the IMF to get us in track and get our finances in order, thanks God! If the authors' viewpoint sounds logical is because they never develop a sound section on the debt crisis and its meaning in the context of the oil crisis, petrodollars and globalization. To be fair, the debt crisis is briefly discussed by Fraser but in the chapter on International Relations (!), which by the way failed to expand on the active role of the US government invading Central American countries and training military officers who later became authoritarian leaders--two themes which in my modest opinion have marked the destinies of Latin America.  2. Race and ethnicity is a tough topic when it comes to teaching American students about Latin America. In Yelvington's essay Guatemala, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Bolivia become side comments. Because his essay explores race and ethnicity from a Black and White traditional American approach. The African presence in Latin America is very important but it is not the only one. A more even approach is needed to explain to young Americans the complexity of Latin America's multicultural/multiracial nature.  3. Finally, there is not a chapter or at least a solid section within a chapter addressing Revolutions in Latin America. Can a Latinamericanist underestimate the impact of revolutions to the extend of excluding it from a book on contemporary Latin America? Have you been in Latin America lately? Aren't government policies in countries with revolutionary tradition aiming at preventing the spread of revolutions? Isn't that in itself significant?  There is a substantial body of research both in Spanish and English that could help American students understand Latin America. Unfortunately, this book does take advantage of these resources.  
 I have not even read the book as of yet. I have just skimmed over reviews written by some of the readers. I understand that this can be an emotional subject for many different reasons. If you come a background in which your anscestors had not been enslaved or lynched or gassed, you may not get why some readers become emotional with this subject matter. I do have a fact based on what I was told from the horse's mouth. Egyptians do consider themselves to be black. I lived in Turkey in 2000 and on my flight back to the U.S., I was waiting in the terminal at the airport in Izmir. This woman kept staring at me. I assumed it was becasue I was the only black woman around and I had grown accustomed to the interest I drew while living in Turkey because it was sincere and genuine. Anyway, she finally approached me and said, "My brother and my nephew and I do not mean to seem impolite, but we are just so happy when we see a brother or sister," I asked what she meant and she said, "Oh, we are black like you, our mother is Egyptian and our father is Turkish, we are black, like you". I noticed their complexions were darker than mine and their was of the same grade as mine. It never occurred to me that they were "black". I noticed that they took such pride in being recognized as such. It really all comes down to what an individual feels he or she identifies most with and what they were taught to believe and whether or not they were taught the truth 
 The way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use.  I would get the Furminator instead, it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes!  This technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove 
 The contrast between the two girls was an interesting starting point, but the disturbing, graphic descriptions of their sexual abuse/abuse of others and the emotional detachment that followed was depressing and not worth reading. Even the thinly veiled references to Ayn Rand and her followers weren't enough to make this awful book worthwhile.  Don't bother with this. 
 Having enjoyed other Ripley stories, I found all the cental characters in the book unlikeley, and discriptions of Ripley and his relationships irritating and was glad to finish the book, by skimming the pages towards the finish.  
 I only read two chapters of the book before I stopped reading. I found these chapters full of clichs and sensationalized stories (at least they appear to be). They also lacked original work and rely too much on other references. As an African, I've read many such stories and I feel that such type of books fail to give one a good understanding of the continent that I know. They just reinforce the stereotypical image westerners have about Africa. If you are expecting a good and honest travel narrative book, this is not it. Don't waste your money or time.  
 I bought a set of GGW videos a few months ago and I COMPLETELY regret it.  This is the worst purchasing experience I've ever had.  Many people have complained about the horrible customer service at GGW.  In my case, I paid extra on my order for speedy delivery.  The charge went against my credit card, so they got immediate payment from me.  My videos were supposed to have been delivered within a couple days, but it wound up taking a couple MONTHS instead!  And only after I complained did they finally deliver them.  But they still didn't reimburse me for the extra expense I had paid for the speedy delivery that never happened.  And if that isn't bad enough, for the last month these jerks have been calling me every day, several times a day.  I get calls at home, I get calls at work.  They called me three times just today.  This is harrassment!  I'm right now researching what my legal options are because their incessant phone calls are making me crazy.  Can you imagine having to explain unsolicited calls you're receiving at work from GGW?  Unless you want to go through the hell I'm being put through, do yourself a favor and please avoid these sorry jerks 
 The book gave insight to the more conservative Amish lifestyles but her explanations for their hard life leaves one to wonder if her husband isn't just a free loader.  She is definitely the worker in that family 
     "Incredible" I saw one review describing this production.  The meaning of the word must have been changed in the dictionary because this is NOT incredible.  It is slow, convoluted and uninspired.  No chemistry exists between the actresses, with no connection to the audience.     
 The battery life does not even come close to the advertised listing. Save your money and wait until Sony does a better job. I am a big fan of all things Sony and this is my first big disappointment. Mar 
 As the rest of Habermas's books, this one is an extremely difficult read. Unless you have previous knowledge of philosophical concepts, you will most likely not understand what Habermas is saying because he makes constant references to other philosophers, concepts and ideas.  Rather than elaborating on them, he assumes that the reader already knows them.  As well, I found that he takes rather simple concepts and makes them unnecessarily complex, as if to sound impressive.  By the time you dig through all the semantic nonsense, you realize that his ideas are not exceptional and they could have been conveyed in a much simpler, straight-forward manner.  This book is a complete waste of time since you will spend hours just trying to understand what he's attempting to say, thinking that you will discover something brilliant, only to be disappointed.  My suggestion is to pick up a different book that is simpler to understand and where the author does not try to make his ideas sound impressive by using unnecessarily complicated language 
 This audio book would be much better read than listened to. There are certain areas that you will not be interested in, and some areas you'll want to read over and over again 
 No doubt the voyage was INCREDIBLE, however the author lacked so much discription and ACTION in the writing, that I have not been able to finish the book. BORING!!! As a matter of fact, 1/3 of the way I cannot make myself pick up the book.  What a disappointment considering the expedition being such an experience of overcoming odds 
 As one who's studied the Mountain Meadows Massacre and other aspects of the Old West, I like a good yarn as much as anyone. This book, however, was a disappointment. Author Sally Denton kept her readership on a short leash and never let anything get in the way of trashing the Mormon church. While other authors kept away from the fraudulent lead tablet while its authenticity was in doubt, Denton showed her disdain by buying it hook, line and sinker.  This tragedy happened before the "Civil War" for goodness sake. Going after the Mormons now is kind of like going after the Israelis for attacking the Liberty back in 1968 -- even worse. No one's left alive who was living back then and there was plenty of animosity between the Mormons and the Yankees, and the Mormons and the emigrants. Californians, who could have kept their mouths shut, constantly threatened the Mormons. In 1862-63, Abraham Lincoln showed how easily he could have civilians murdered and their homes burned with hardly any backlash.  Mountain Meadows was not unprovoked, but it was inexcusable. The right people were never brought to justice and Brigham Young should have seen that they were. But I don't think Denton's animosity now is justified. With all the Southerners murdered by the Union, Mountain Meadows was totally insignificant in comparison.   
 The synopsis of this title sounds extremely similiar to "Kingdom Come" by the same author.  Was there a mixup 
 the first one was all right it held my intist but why did the make a sequel? it is worse then the first one and really should not have been made I suggest this for only lovvers of the firs 
 Jane Austen's last novel, published posthumously, receives this year's Clunky Boring Classic Award.  Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19.  Lauded by the literary types as exemplifying Austen's wit and irony, it's really just a simplistic romance in which all characters spend far too much ink flapping their gums 
 This book was a serious disappointment.  Definitely search elsewhere if you want to build with bamboo.  
 To be fair, I don't think someone can accurately tell the story of the Rolling Stones in 600 pages; it's been an extreme 40-year career, full of ups and downs for 7 talented and colorful band mates, countless managers, wives, girlfriends, musical contemporaries, along a socially changing atmosphere surrounded by endless drugs, sex and money. 600 pages would be a good start on a biography of only one of the musicians, let alone trying to capture the history of the whole band and everyone involved with their phenomenal success.  The book paints a very sad, trashy image of the band. It tells tales of a sordid past, but doesn't offer a fair counterbalance. I get the feeling that I was reading a tabloid newspaper; not representing a fair side of the story, but sparing no ghastly detail of their misery. For instance, I happen to know that Mick Jagger used to own a home in Venice Italy, however this was not mentioned in the book; what was mentioned were various tales from the homes where his drug or party reputation gained the most momentum. Other facts and/or journeys were neglected to save room for the real dirt.  This book is very heavy on the drug stories, but light on insights to their individual and collective personalities so we might catch a glimpse as to why they were taking so many drugs. It will speak about how high they were when they recorded album "X", but then after listening to album "X", you hear some great songs and wonder how someone you've been led to believe was out of their mind could participate and contribute to an extremely enjoyable end product.  The book also skips through the last 10 years in 40 pages or so. It made me think that they couldn't dig up any sources to give dirt during this period, so the author whizzed through it.  All in all, it's a tabloid newspaper. And I believe the tales in it. I happen to want a fair balanced perspective to really learn about the band, not just their tales of woe. But with the kind of career like the Stones have had, this perspective would require several thousand pages. It's really your call.. 
 This book is only masquerading as a textbook -- it is a propaganda tool for those who want to stick their heads in the sand and not talk honestly about contraception.  Check the index for yourself -- "birth control" and "contraception" are NOT EVEN LISTED.  The section on AIDS does NOT MENTION condom use.  It is appalling that in this day and age a textbook to be used in health class can leave out science, truth, and a well-rounded discussion of responsible use of contraceptives.  This book deserves far less than 1 star.  
 That one day 4 year olds will be able to actually read this book. This book is not meant for kids aged 4-8. It is well beyond what they understand. Frankly , i don't even think a 4 year old can even read this. Nice pictures. But unfortunately , i don't enjoy buying a book for pictures. I can get pictures anywhere. I didn't need to purchase this book to get them. Anyway , don't buy this book unless you enjoy paying a high price for pictures. With regards to the age group. Unless you have a gifted 4 year old this book is a waste of time for him/her 
 Reminded me of a UT student on the 7 year plan. A great 200 page story that is told in 380 pages. Hope the next is better 
 The author clearly has a problem with men.  Most of the book reads like a collection of the author's opinions and rants.  The arguments are circular and redundant.  I stopped a little over halfway through the book because I was weary from reading the same statements over and over.  
 Discursive and digressive, David Thomson's `The Whole Equation' is less a history of Hollywood than a meditation on the business of making pictures.  The book's title comes from a line in F. Scott Fitzgerald's `The Last Tycoon' and refers, I believe, to the multi-faceted quality of picture making.  Motion pictures are products, widgets produced by a place called Hollywood; they are also art, as well as a mirror to our culture, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.    I wanted to like this book.  Thomson seems to be a well-respected film critic and I'm not averse to jumping on a passing bandwagon, but I also wanted to learn a little of the history of Hollywood.  You know, facts piled upon facts?  Thomson is more inclined to impression and analyses, some of it a bit off the board.  The chapter "Divorce, America Style" examines the connection between the rise of the divorce rate in America with what was happening in motion pictures.  It isn't the first, or the last, time Thomson strays to pursue such things.     If you have the patience for it there are some amusing moments, but if you're like me, looking for a just-the-facts history of Hollywood `The Whole Equation' isn't it.  
 I was browsing the index for the new edition and lots of topics fail to appear. One I was especially interested is inotify. Kinda odd that it doesn't make the index.  PHPTR has also put out some kernel books and they were disappointing 
 this guy writes a nice autobiography about how he did it in marketing... maybe interesting for some but not for me. I guess I was expecting something more than a horn blowing fanfare of an "I did it my way" brag-o-rama 
 Understand, I love Springsteen.  Born to Run is my second favorite album of all time.  I have seen him live over a dozen times.  I personally think he is the single most important American rock and roll artist ever (with apologies to Elvis, Chuck Berry and Dylan).  I even loved Nebraska, so don't tell me it's an E-Street band thing or a rock versus folk thing, but this album is unlistenable.    Some reviewers have called it beautiful and powerful.  That's rubbish.  There is a complete absence of melody on this record, as was the case with much of The Ghost of Tom Joad album (with a huge exception being "Youngstown" - a great song).  The apparently willful attempt to alter his singing style to sound like Woody Guthrie or Jimmy Rodgers is just frightening.  Dylan could pull it off, Bruce just disappoints.  But it's the songs and lack of anything remotely resembling melody that makes this record a failure.  Believe, I listened to Devil & Dust 10-15 times in hopes of finding what I am apparently missing.  I couldn't. I thought The Rising was a nice album.  I even liked the Devils & Dust solo tour (Bruce is a powerful performer, and maybe even more commading when it's just him on stage), but I doubt this CD will ever find its way back into the player 
 I love many of the films featured in this book, have seen many of them, and have read many books on the subject. Despite that, I just can't bring myself to like this book. Many of the worst attributes (gore, depravity, etc.) are glorified, analyzed, and rationalized in this book, while many of the more innocent pleasures of low-budget films are largely glossed over.   While I disliked the vast majority of the book, finding it ponderous and pretentious, I gave it an extra star (I had originally given it only one) for the insightful interviews with Ray Dennis Steckler and Doris Wishman, two of the true giants of the genre. Steckler and Wishman contrast markedly with the ghastly Frank Henenlotter, and the insufferably long interview with the ever self-important Larry Cohen plods on for an excruciating 26 pages.  The book has a modestly interesting "Genre Articles" section, which is like a longitudinal study of trends in B-movies (and therefore is useful to serious students of film) but the self-indulgent "Film Essays" section is a painful exercise in over-analysis.   As much as I love most of these films, I can't recommend this book. It is smug and intolerant (especially of organized religion and the US military) at all turns, and there are many better guides available.  As a side note, the book itself is very poorly made. The binding on my copy cracked and fell off, with all the pages falling out during the first reading. The book was in such poor condition that I put it in the recycling bin at the airport when I finished it today...not that I'll miss it.   Two stars for Steckler and Wishman (and for mentioning Coleman Francis). 
 Wow, if you have read previous ten reviews you'll think that Mr. Pancake was the embodiment of Faulkner, Tennessee Williams and Malmud. It is truly unfortunate that he killed himself in 1979. If he had lived, today he might be one of America's great short story writers. His writing style is measured and sparse. It is as if he had not looked to expand his writer's pallet of possibilities.   Pancake's is a story worth knowing for its sense of profound loss not its sense of contribution. His stories of West Virginia draw you in and leave you with a satisfaction of understanding the protagonists and their situations. But, there are no deep messages. The deep messages were still in the heart and brain that were stopped by a self inflected shotgun blast. Cry for the loss. There is not a volume of work to celebrate 
 Alice Randall's original concept for "The Wind Done Gone" was for it to be a parody of "Gone with the Wind" in the style of "Shamela."  I haven't read "Shamela" (or "Pamela," which it is based on), but from what I have gathered, "Pamela" is a story about a virtuous woman who scorns her employer's advances, while in "Shamela," this woman is turned into a whore who was playing her employer all along.  If Randall was trying to make a story like that, then she succeeded.  If "Gone with the Wind" was a world of strong, intelligent, good white Southerners and their stupid but kind-hearted black slaves; then "The Wind Done Gone" is a novel where those white people are shown to be morons and fools who understand little and are really controlled by those they thought they ruled (unless they're gay, like "Dreamy Gentleman" and "Beauty" - then they're nice people).  In this sense, "The Wind Done Gone" succeeds.  Unfortunately, Randall was so busy ripping down the characters of "Gone with the Wind" that she forgot to create her own.  I totally agree that Cynara/Cinnamon/Cindy is a Mary Sue.  Unfortunately, she's not a very interesting one.  She spends most of the story whining and moping about how she is so beautiful yet no one will ever accept her because she is black and she can't believe her parents betrayed her and on and on and on...  The only time she does anything is when she leaves R. and enters into an improbable menage-a-trois with a black Congressman and a black woman who reminds her of Mealy Mouth (Melanie).  By that time, I could care less.  With a boring heroine (and that's particuarly insulting, considering what a complex heroine Scarlett O'Hara was) and a story that goes nowhere, this book doesn't have much.  I didn't buy that any of the characters of "Gone with the Wind" would act as they did in this book.  The idea of Scarlett taking blame for something Cynara did, Melanie killing a slave out of anger, or Gerald having sex with Mammy is preposterous.  However, if Randall had managed to make an interesting story, I would have forgiven it.  Unfortunately, she didn't.  The only character who really benefited from any revision was Lady (Ellen O'Hara) but the revelation that she had black blood seemed to only make an unclear point.  This book is good as a curiosity, and nothing more.  
 I thought this was a terriable book by itself, but makes for a nice companion when reading through McQuarrie's book.  McQuarrie skimps out on some of the explanations and instead leaves it to the reader to figure it out for themselves by solving his problems at the end of the chapter.  One can usually find the answers (or at least some hints) within this book 
 This is a good book, but certainly not a great one.  I was lead to believe from newspaper reviews that this would be a "good read", a history book with a compelling narrative that would be hard to put down. Instead it is a rather dry mixture of high school history (lots of names and politics, often somewhat confusing) with a narrative that never really becomes compelling.  The beginning is a dry mini-history of the Persian Empire, then of Sparta, then of Athens. It finally picks up momentum about half way through when the actual wars start. Even then,though, the narrative continues to get bogged down and never really becomes a good story; with few exceptions it feels like  you are reading some student's term paper. If you are not in love with history to start with, this book will certainly not turn you on to the subject. On the other hand, the story itself is so fascinating it almost compensates for the weaknesses of the book 
 I didn't like this book.  It's about giving zero tolerance to children's rudeness.  The authors are convinced that there way is right.  It is authoritarian style parenting. It's supposed to be about logical consequences but the consequences are not logical just punishing. They don't recommend, they tell you what you must do. They say that not taking your child to a concert where people are relying on him to perform is how to deal with rudeness and teach him/her how to be respectful of other people!!!  Parent's need to see the bigger picture and deal with the situation which includes the child's rudeness and not focus solely on that.  
 I've read other books by the author and truly enjoyed them.  Not this one.  Cleage revisits characters from, "Some Things I Thought I'd Never Do".  The book starts out promising, then introduces to many characters.  This could have been two good books instead of one mediocre book. 
 This novel could not hold my interest.  I am an Anne Perry fan, but could not get into this book.  I couldn't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting.   I'm really disappointed, because I was looking forward to a new series by her.  Joseph and Matthew lost their parents to murder and Joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion.  Maybe Ms. Perry tried to tell too many stories within one story.  In reviewing the book, it's hard to pin point exactly why I didn't like this book. I would skip this series and read the Pitt series.   
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 Tuva is a remote area smack in the center of Asia, nestled in the mountains between Siberia and Mongolia. Traditional Tuvan throat-singing is an amazing thing--the singer produces two notes AT THE SAME TIME, a low drone and a higher melody. This Smithsonian/Folkways CD was probably the first Tuvan CD available in the US; it was around when CD co-producer Ted Levin first brought three Tuvan throat-singers on an American tour. Unfortunately, the CD is primarily of ethnomusicological interest. There are brief examples of the various styles of khoomei (the general Tuvan name for throat-singing), but there are few tracks that can really be considered songs, and all but a few of the vocal tracks are a cappella. Only three of the 33 tracks on the CD are more than two minutes long. There is also plenty of jaw harp, animal imitations, a solo for hunting horn, and herders' calls to their flocks. If you're interested in hearing Tuvan MUSIC, you're better off with "Tuva: Voices from the Land of the Eagles", Ellipsis Arts' CD/book "Deep in the Heart of Tuva", or any CD by Huun-Huur-Tu 
 Hard to get through, I was bored after the first 30 minutes.  It was poorly written, directed and edited... the storyline just wasn't there.  It became redundant with lines of fortune cookie text scrolling accross the screen.  Its too bad since the artists represented have been an influence in my practice.  If you want to be inspired, Piece By Piece is a great doc. about the history of SF graffiti.  Style Wars will always be a classic.  Graffiti Verite 1 is watchable 
 I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch 
 This guy is a serious jerk.  Don't buy this book and support his cause -- which is anti-everything-decent.  Buy Al Franken's book on him instead -- much more accurate and interesting 
 Bottom line... 1. If you liked Gore, you will love it and visa versa. 2. It is one-sided, plain and simple.   3. Nobody considers the poor inept voter who failed to comprehend a simple ballot, or the responsibility of a voter to unsterstand at least enough English to distinguish "GORE from BUSH".  Democrats wanted quantity, and the lack of quality also extended into the indecisive and ambiguous recount procedures that hundreds of lawyers just couldn't get right.  
 I have read every book about the Laci Peterson story, and this by far is the worst publication I have witnessed.  This book not only avoids the mass response by the public and media but devoices it of its presence.  It has also unjustified the heartbreak and torture Laci Peterson's family has had to endure.  
 I had high hopes when picking up this book.  In the end I found little of use.  Perhaps I was looking for more than an approach that was business oriented.  Information displays for systems monitoring are a topic almost completely missed in the book.  
 Bike lock manufacturer Kryptonite recently revealed that tubular cylinder locks -- which this model uses -- can be very easily picked. Kinda defeats the purpose of owning this in the first place. 
 Alyssa Milano's mother (who is also her manager) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet.  She's denounced such websites' "exploitation" on national TV, and has even developed a side business as a cybercop, lending her web-busting skills to other stars.  Milano's mother/manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film.  Embrace of the Vampire is softcore horror porn, and the source for many of those Milano skin pics.  After TV's Who's the Boss was canceled (but before Charmed returned Milano to star status) Milano was just another unemployed former child actress, so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the time.   Milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to demonstrate that she was not the goody-two-shoes girl she'd played in Who's the Boss.  In other words, she wanted to "grow" as an actress.  So she did Embrace of the Vampire, in which she goes topless in several scenes, engages in a lesbian romp with Charlotte Lewis, and participates in orgies with characters tonguing various parts of her nude body.  Mission accomplished.  Actually, Embrace of the Vampire uses Milano's virginal image from Who's the Boss by casting her as ... a virgin.  A virgin whose boobs are straining against her too-tight blouse and who undresses before her boyfriend (albeit asking him not to look), but still, a virgin.  A virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles lesbians and doesn't know why.  Here's why: Milano is the reincarnation of Martin Kemp's true love.  Some 300 years ago, a pack of scantily clad vampresses turned Kemp into a vampire during a blood orgy.  Now that he's rediscovered Milano, he has three nights to rekindle her love for him.  If so, they will live forever as vampires.  If not, he dies and loses her forever.  Why the sudden three-night deadline?  Why not.  The plot and motivations are paper thin, as is typical of porn.  Milano wanders around campus, wondering why she's having so many sexual dreams, even daydreams.  Her boyfriend wanders about, wondering if she's so pure.  Kemp wanders about, seen by Milano but often not by others.  Lewis wanders about for some bisexual action.  Other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action.  Amid all this wandering there's much carnal action, and more carnal dreaming.  Occasionally, Kemp kills someone for dissing Milano.  John Stanley (in his Creature Features movie guide) correctly refers to it as a "meandering, almost formless script."  Kemp has the best lines.  Like many vampires, he agonizes and suffers a hyper-romantic vampire angst over a lost love.  His appearance is a touch effeminate (too much eyeliner), but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character.  He is part romantic vampire, part bloodthirsty beast.  Lewis's small part is pointless to the "story."  All that's required is that she undress, and when she does, it was worth the wait.  Rachel True (The Craft) has an even smaller role, the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on.  All of the above three are more interesting, more charismatic, than Milano or her boyfriend.  At film's end, Kemp's tearful bloodthirsty angst, and Milano's tearful rediscovery of her love, the "tragic" star-crossed ending, and the Christian iconography, all mirror Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).  One senses that director Goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material.  However, this is no poor woman's Bram Stoker's Dracula.  Milano is no Winona Ryder and Kemp is no Gary Oldman.  For that matter, none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts.  And the budget just isn't there.  The strength of low-budget horror is a gritty authenticity, which this film tries to hide rather than utilize.  How low was the budget?  Listen, I was an extra on both Bram Stoker's Dracula and Embrace of the Vampire.  (In both instances, I kept my clothes on.)  I worked one day on Embrace of the Vampire.  Don't look for me, I ended up on the cutting room floor, and extras are rarely mentioned in credits.  But let me tell you an "inside story" on the making of this film:  We were shooting in a nightclub on the Sunset Strip.  The extras were divided into three camps: union, nonunion, and Modesto extras.  Union extras earn the most, especially once overtime kicks in, so they were wrapped after eight hours (they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota).  This was during my nonunion days (I'm in SAG now), so I put in a full 14 hours, after which we were paid in cash and wrapped.  The Modesto extras were still working when we left.  Now what, you may ask, is a Modesto extra?  I also wondered, and so I asked one.  I was told they were from an acting class in Modesto, California.  They had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a "class assignment."  In other words, they were PAYING to come to work.  There's not a whole lot to learn about being an extra.  It's neither glamourous nor difficult.  And nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are VERY EASY to come by.  The lampposts in Los Angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle, ehr, extras.  I did it for the cash, and because if you do it often enough, you increase your chances of getting into the union (which I did, after some 13 grueling months).  NEVER PAY for the "chance" to be an extra, not in Los Angeles.  I made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times, but wised up after a few months.  My guess is the producers of Embrace of the Vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle, and far less than even nonunion extras cost.  I know this teacher was getting paid by the students, and that they were not getting paid to be on the film.  Another inside story: Someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member.  She was near tears because it had sentimental value.  Never leave anything of value lying around on a set.  And some trivia: John Stanley says this film was "originally conceived as The Nosferatu Diaries," but on the set, we were told the working title was The Collector.  Embrace of the Vampire is a decent time-killer ... barely.  If you're looking for horror, there are hundreds of better films.  Dozens of better vampire films.  Even many superior erotic vampire films -- Vampyres (British, 1975) comes to mind.  But if you're looking for Milano nudies, this is the film to see. 
 This album is way too drum machine and synthetic sounding.  Very dissappointing and missing a major element that most naked music artists bring to this label. I've heard a few remixed blue 6 tracks that sound amazing, but the artists that mixed them added the element that "Beautiful Tomorrow" does NOT possess. I feel only dissapointment 95% of the time while listening to this album.  
 While this book contains a wide range of topics of interest to those considering parenthood, it doesn't cover these topics with very much detail.  I would have found it more helpful if the stories of the women interviewed had been longer than a paragraph apiece.  Overall, this book is useful in that it brings up many important issues for consideration, but in my opinion, it served only as a "springboard" for further research 
 Borrow the book from the library.  Wasting your money on fables is not wise (unless you like wasting money).  While entertaining, this is not worthy of a library collection item 
 I admire Vollman's ambition in this novel.  He is a thinker who seems to be attempting to tie together aspects of religion (Buddhism, Christianity, and Paganism . . . ); commentary on the differences / similarities of love, lust, and addiction; Capitalism versus Marxism; racism between all colors of all people; classicism; reality and fantasy; misogyny; unions; child-love or child-molestation depending how you look at it . . . the list goes on.  And this is exactly the problem with it.  The connections are vague--not subtle.  Fragments connected by tiny threads that fray as the book continues leave us suspended in a kind of weird sickness--ready to fall.  If I were Vollman, I would have let this book sit for a while and then returned to it in an attempt to clarify and condense . . . maybe map out this Royal Family to make it worth his while and worth our while as readers.  His characterizations and insight about human fraily are immaculate.  I don't advise giving up on him yet.  He has potential.  But I don't think spending days reading this will get you anywhere but depressed and tired 
 i don't why anybody liked this book. the story line wasn't bad it was just that is was way to vague and not enough interaction with the characters. i mean there is hardly any conversation at all 
 Even as a kid, I remember getting bored with Pippi quickly. Unless I'm not recalling correctly, each chapter stands alone, so there's no real plot as such. The other thing that bothered me was that the author bothered to create a defiant, irreverant, spunky girl hero, yet her two friends are stereotypically male and female, to the extent that they don't even have personalities--they're just cardboard cutouts, foils for the main character. Not only is Annika fearful, hesitant, afraid of risking adult disapproval, and not wanting to get her dress dirty, but she's not in the least influenced by Pippi to be more adventurous. Lindgren sold lots of books but to my mind didn't accomplish much. Unlike Caddie Woodlawn, this protagonist is too far out in left field to truly inspire girls 
 alex cross. yes. james patterson. yes. stories about sex, violence, murder, thrill, suspence, money, victems, etc. PLEASE DO NOT INVOLVE PREGNANCY'S AND CHILDREN! this is too much. 
 ...where are the editors when you need them?...maybe this could have been a good 50 page book describing some difficult mathematical problems...as it stands it rambles on for two hundred plus pages with information that is shallow if you know a lot about math and incomprehensible if you don't...get it from the library 
 I have read more than half of the book and am very disappointed with the content.  He spends far too much time explaining how things were done in SharePoint Services v2 and then how they are different in v3.  I was hoping for more information about how to do things in SharePoint v3 but there is not enough meat to actually get in and do anything.  
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible 
 This is an ok atlas for neuro anatomy but I found it lacked some pathways. However, what it does have in pathways is fairly clear and concise. Still, the slides lack clarity so some stuff is hard to understand 
 Wow.  Where do I even begin?  It is sad to think that so many Americans are as misinformed about Iraq and the war on terror as this Darryl Worley is.  First off, I don't know anyone who is saying "you shouldn't worry about Bin Laden."  If anything people against the war in Iraq wanted our government to spend more time and efforts tracking down al-Qaeda's leader.    The fact that Bush Jr. will not make the hunt for Bin Laden his #1 priority is one of the many reasons why millions of Americans voted for Kerry.  They want a leader who will stand up and protect us from the mastermind who attacked us and not send us on a wild goose chase like what Bush Jr. has unfortunatly done.  Think for once Darryl!   Next, if you are going to write a song about invading Iraq at least make references to it.  Also, now that the war in Iraq and our president's approval ratings are so low. I doubt Darryl Worley would ever make a sequel song about staying the course in Iraq.  He and his managers are probably thinking about the next tragedy to cash in on.  Hmmmm maybe he will $ing about Hurricane Katrina next...  We have spent so-far 500 billon dollars and more than that worth in human life lost in Iraq, all that in  a war that "ended" according to our president on May 1, 2003.  Perhaps, outsourcing jobs to other countries should be extended to crappy songwriters too. 
 I am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf.  I had to return it 
 Mick Taussig's fetishism with fetishism is shown at new levels in this book.  This pomo work of fantasy is almost a parody of the stupidity with which anthropology has retreated from a world inhabited by real people with real problems to a never ending exercise in self exploration.  This book shows Taussig to care only about himself and his whims in ways betraying not only his own narcissism, but that of contemporary anthropology as it praises such self important musings while ignoring the voices of other cultures. 
 Good current trend analysis. Personal political bias reflected. Technical errors: Thinks methane is a fuel - it is not, Thinks is clean - actually causes more pollution to make than gasoline causes when burned.  No conclusions on trends, only vague thoughts and recommends positive thinking 
 I didn't realize how out of date this book was, or I would not have bought it.  The book makes 80s-era references when it comes to diet, nutrition, and other books about fitness.  He suggests that you'd better plan to spend a whole $45 dollars on a good pair of running shoes!  The author is readable, and his personal experiences are somewhat interesting.  But although he is an M.D., there seems to be no scientific basis for his recommendations - it is all based on his personal experience 
 I bought this DVD because of how much I admire Kathleen Battle,  Kurt Moll and the Deutsche Grammophon label.  At first I was very pleased.  But after having watched it many times, the flaws are becoming more and more apparent.  But I may just be nit-picking.  The argument below regarding Battle being wrong to play Pamina because she is African-American is absurd. She has singing talent. Period.  She's not that great of an actress, though.  Her range of facial expressions goes from happy to bewildered...and even those expressions don't look all that different.  This is a problem because there are times during the opera when she is supposed to be distraught.  Instead she looks like she is confused by the urge to sneeze.  Terrible.  Battle is now of the age where it would be more appropriate to cast her as the Queen of the Night.  She and Araiza were simply too old to be playing the parts of young lovers. (I'm sorry, but it's true.)  Papageno (Manfred Hemm) was very funny. I reckon that he stole the show.  To be frank, I thought the duet between Papageno and Papagena was much better in Bergman's version.  Positive: solid singing performances, good sound and picture quality as one expects from DG. Negative: poor casting/acting of some key roles 
 Any attempt to display Karl Marx as a sympathetic prophet mustfail if one is marginally familier with his story. The real Marx, assketched out by Paul Johnson in his wonderful book Intellectuals, was a disasater as a human being,which no doubt fueled his resentment against capitalism. If you read Zinn's comments about this play, you will see the same resentment at work. I have no doubts that Zinn's parents worked hard. HARD work , however, is NOT the source of wealth. I could spend years trying to empty the Atlantic ocean with a shot glass. It would be very hard work, but of value to very few. Capitalism rewards hard work and hard thought that results in the creation of something valuable to large numbers of people.  Thus the production of the automobile, oil, and operating systems lead to great fortunes. I am charitable enough to admit that Marx would have been horrified by the 100 million deaths commited in his name in the 20th century, but this literary whitewash is absurd 
 I expected this book to be an account of the author's being born again as a Christian.  Unfortunately the book contains very little material on this subject.  Rather it is a pedestrian account of a rather boring boyhood and adolescence.  His only slightly veiled anti-Semitic remarks contribute to a very uncomplimentary self-portrait 
 This book would not be helpful for children of faiths other than Christianity 
 Haven't finished reading it, I actually put it aside because it is very stiff, doesn't grab my attention and I feel like the book is talking down to me.  I have read previous Berkley Sensation books (which is why I purchased this one) but have not been impressed with this one 
 In addition to the fact that I, too, felt that I was enduring a commercial for DFA, I was annoyed by the fact that this book is nothing more than a rehash of The Only Guide to a Winning Investment Strategy You'll Ever Need: Index Mutual Funds and Beyond - The Way Smart Money Invests Today, Swedroe's May, 1998 book. He introduces a small number of new studies and illustrations, but if you've read the first book, there's no reason to look at this one 
 Daniel Greenberg, a Washington-based journalist, analogizes the American scientific activities after WWII as a metropolis dominated with academic cultures in its core. In contrast to the general conception that the budget for the basic research has been cut since the "golden age," or 1960s, the financial support to science enterprises actually has increased. He argues that the problems in the American science have not come from a deficiency of money but from a self-ghettoized, apolitical scientific enterprise of science itself which only competes for the public money but is ignorant of social consequences of what it does. He suggested more political involvement and enlightenment in the scientific communities as a prescription.  Recent study shows that there is a room for even the "self-ghettoized," "apolitical" enterprises of science, as called by the author, to be admitted to be raised as "the fifth branch" (Jasanoff, 1990) which bridges science and policy through the scientific advisory board. Although tons of conversational examples were presented in the book, many questions remain still ambiguous: for example, how political ignorance was gauged; to what other enterprises it can be compared (if possible); how the political ignorance negatively affected public welfare.  I admire the author's effort to incorporate all the transient newspaper articles and volatile dialogues among the congressmen and the heads of various scientific institutions into a 500 paged book. To read Introduction and Epilogue seems enough for this book, unless you have a plenty of time or historian-like interests in the episodes occurred in the Washington regarding the research policy and budgeting 
 The statements in the book reads as a SUN document. So if you dont want to take the trouble to sit in front of a computer and search through all the links for certification objectives in SUN website, you can purchase this book. 
 I found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend's house.  I asked my friend if she'd read it and she said, "Not yet, but it's a Patterson, so it must be good..."  Wrong-er words were never spoken.  This is the first Patterson novel I have read.  I am glad that I borrowed it from someone rather than bought it myself.  I suggest that if you insist on reading this, than you would be wise to do the same.  Let me just say that I don't enjoy giving bad reviews, but this is perhaps one of the most poorly written novels I have ever read.  I feel compelled to warn others so they can be spared the disappointment I experienced.  Maybe because it was "co-written" by this Gross person, but it just seems that this book was written too quickly, with the characters and the plot as a mere afterthought.    I kept reading, hoping that the story would get better, but it siimply did not.  When one of the characters was in mortal danger, I found myself thinking "who cares?"  This boring read has an utterly predicitable love-story woven throughout, and again, it seems pointless and cheesy.  One reviewer put it best by saying that this book is more like an outline of a story rather than a comprehensive novel.    The plot twists are predictable and uninteresting, and you sort of want to root for the bad guys because the main characters are soooo boring and flat.  The sentence structure is so elementary that I was surprised that this was written by an accomplished author and not a sixth grade English student.  I am by no means a "book snob" but I cannot believe that someone would review this book with a 4 or 5 star rating.  It is just beyond me.  If you are looking at the writing alone, it is terrible, not to mention the unbelievable events that take place.  Main character Boxer is always in the right place at the right time and everything comes together so neatly that you just cannot believe any of the events could possibly take place.  I know that a lot of die-hard Patterson fans will probably give me bad ratings just because I didn't like this book, but I am trying to be as honest as possible.    Maybe some of his earlier works are better?  Well, I guess they couldn't be a whole lot worse in any case 
 Yes, this book is a chaotic mess; a manic hodgepodge of opinions and prejudice, arrogantly passed off as fact.  I couldn't get past the first 80 pages before returning it to the library (I'm thankful I didn't buy it).  That said, there are some useful strategies, which can be found in the book or at the author's website.  Directing one's thinking away from the negative thought is obviously good advice.  Not easy, but surely good advice if one can manage it.  Preparing in advance, eg having little comfortable sayings or quotes one can repeat to one's self if the depression hits.  These aren't original ideas; there's the well-known "thought-stopping" method that calls for changing a negative to a positive or neutral thought.  There's mindfulness, which moves attention from inner pain to the here and now, the concrete.  There are many other similar strategies.  I agree with much of what Ms Curtiss says about big pharma's drive to maximize profits with little regard for the interests of the patient.  Just today I was in a doctor's office and happened to see some literature a drug rep had left.  There was a survey to fill out to find out if you had "ES."  Curious, I read the survey questions.  They were so general that really, they could apply to anybody.  So, what was this new disease, "ES"?  "Excessive sleep. 
 Despite the cult status that has grown up around him, Fitzgerald was not nearly the artist Hemingway was.  Most of this fiction was written for  money, and it's obvious: it's far too slick, too self-consciously snappy to  qualify as art.  I rather like Fitzgerald's dictum that one should write  for the youth of his generation, the schoolteachers of the next, and the  critics of all time.  Trouble is, that same youthfulness and obsession with  being au courant is the work's strength and its greatest limitation.   Perhaps because of this self-declared aim, much of the work now seems  hopelessly dated, naive, and surprisingly racist.  Still, part of their  "charm," if that's the right word, is the stories' evocation of an era.   More than a handful of them together, though, begins to feel like the  script to a Fred Astaire movie like Top Hat, and the effervescence -- like  the bubbles in champagne -- begins to cloy after a few glasses.    I've had  teachers who say that one doesn't care about Fitzgerald's characters.  I'm  not sure that's true.  What I DO feel may be true, especially after reading  Max Perkins, Editor of Genius (a great biography that will make the "lost  generation" the bulk of your reading list for some time to come), is that  Fitzgerald never really grew up, never really developed a sense of what  people were like, or what their deepest concerns were.  I also suspect that  he wasn't especially bright: there's a lot of pseudo-intellectualism on  display throughout.  Fitzgerald's characters seem shallow perhaps because  the times were, but also, I begin to think,  because Fitzgerald himself was  unable to supply the depth of understanding and wisdom required of the best  artists.  In the end, like the strikingly handsome figures of his day, he  cuts quite a figure, but leaves little in the way of a lasting impression.   Of course, with any writer of Fitzgerald's stature, there are a few gems,  among them "The Ice Palace," "Jacob's Ladder" and "A Captured Shadow."  On  the other hand, a story like "More Than Just a House" is more illustrative  of the vast majority here: while the story proceeds very well for a while,  somehow it never quite adds up to much, and I can't help  wondering if this  is one of the endings Fitzgerald "altered" for the Saturday Evening Post,  as he confesses to Hemingway in "A Moveable Feast."  For the most part,  these stories give a reader none of what one wants in the best of  literature.  They're just diversions, and seem such a waste of talent and  time.  Far from revealing "A vastly new and amplified Fitzgerald," as the  blurb of some dim reviewer intones on the book's cover, this collection of  stories confirms that all but a handful are hackwork, as was the prevailing  opinion of most critics up to this point anyway.  Sadly, nothing in this  collection seems destined to change that 
 This book is nothing more than Christian fundamentalist evangelism that is couched in being "cool" and "relateable" to teenagers, and the sentiments expressed therein are hateful and potentially severely damaging to the self-esteem and psyche of any young girl who is exposed to it.  Instead of employing any kind of rationality, Ms. DiMarco calls sexually active girls "prostitutes" and states that since men can not help themselves when they are sexually aroused, God will punish the girl, and the girl only, for any sexual activity that may result.  Girls are also warned that no guy is interested in what she has to say, they just pretend so to get them in the sack.  It is repulsive.            There are many more sexuality books written from a Christian perspective to choose from, most that have a far more caring, fair and meaningful message to send.  Please do not buy this book for your teenage girl.  
 If you, like me, have recently discovered this amazing writer recently you will be tempted to read his final words laid out in this book.  I however was a little disappointed.  The writing does not flow effortlessly.  He refers to a lot of names (politicians, artists, and writers, etc.) and places, but I'm afraid the majority of these references will only make sense to a European history buff.  In fact, much of the book will only hold the interest of a history student.  I had hoped the book would document HIS world of yesterday thoroughly--his motivations for writing particular books etc.--instead it goes into details about Europe far too much.  An OK read, but if you want to skip this one you won't be missing much.  Maybe his best work was far too good and this mediocre, long-winded good-bye pales against it 
 Some of the Reacher novels--such as The Killing Floor--have been incredibly good, but I was genuinely disappointed in this one.  The author describes Reacher as heroic, a loner, etc., but instead he should write in such a way that we reach these insights without being told.  Phrases, such as "back in the day," get repeated much too often.  Reacher has become a caricature of himself 
 Japan imported diversity when it brought in Koreans pre-war, and then, in the era of 'developed Japan', when it brought in workers from all over Asia and Latin America. The JET Programme mostly imported well intentioned middle class young people who brought inevitably brought cultural and political pabulum from the anglophone world in an attempt to shore up English education, and when that failed, the people running the programme turned it into one big 'cross-cultural' exchange between essentially middle class westerners and middle class Japanese, with the Japanese taxpayer footing the bill.  Now a warning. Most books about Japan do the following: (1) they emphasize how EXOTIC Japan is, (2) they emphasize how MESSED UP Japan is, and (3) they reduce Japan to a monomaniacal thesis so westerners who don't know any better can think they learned something.  I won't say that this book suffers from number 3, but numbers 1 and 2 are pretty well covered.   This book isn't really very informative if you have been on the programme, and it isn't going to be of much use for those going on the programme (better to get a hold of real Jet people on the web and at sites like ELT News). 
 Netgear is supposed to have a 5 year warranty (2 on the power supply).    I had one of these for about 18 months.   Over the last months it's been increasingly flaky, every week or two it just hangs and needs to be unplugged and started again.  It doesn't matter how much it's in use (it's done it when we've been on vacation with minimal network traffic).  I called Netgear to get it replaced, but they told me that it's not meant to be plugged in all day, so they won't fix it.    Unless you actually unplug all your network equipement when you are not actively using it (I didn't think so), then I highly recommend avoiding Netgear products 
 This blatently derivative (hat tip to Ridley Scott's Alien, with a hint of Stanley Donen's Saturn 3 thrown in) movie should surely win the award for the most irritatingly gratuitous over-use of strobe lighting ever. This makes it extremely uncomfortable to watch and is, presumably, employed to detract from the lack of any genuine thrills. Throw in a ridiculously precocious ship's computer and a downright silly robot, and this adds up to one helluva big turkey in space. James Spader and Angela Bassett do their best to make something out of an inadequate script and plot, but this is unremittingly dreadful and dull.  The "happy ever after" finale will probably make you cringe in its corniness. Supernova's only redeeming factor is that it is very short 
 If you have tinted windows this product does not work 
 One of the most disastrous purchases we've ever made.  It works fine until you try to get the video images onto your computer.  Don't bother trying to consult the instruction guide; it's the worst one you've ever seen.  You could go to the website to attempt to download all the drivers that you supposedly need, but they're not actually on the website.  DEFINITELY find another brand 
 You have to read through over 250 pages leading up to about 30 pages of what I was looking for in the first place:  action and some suspense.  You could just skip the first couple hundred pages and get right to the real story.  Excellent book for the readers digest version without really missing anything.  Also all the political discussions came across as so phony that it really hurt any sence of reality 
 Everyone else seems to adore this book so I guess I have lost my sense of humor because I just don't like this particular version-- at least not for the 3 and under set.    My first objection stems from the use of bug spray by the 'old lady' to get rid of the fly.  She is shown sitting on a couch surrounded by cans of depleted insecticide while spraying more in her mouth.  Rather than find this funny, it scared me to think that some child might get a notion to copy this activity.    Then second is my objection to boiling a cat and chasing a dog with the same intent.  Now most children wouldn't do this so that's not a problem but I still don't like the idea of introducing this weird concept to my little boy.  (My son asked me if we needed to keep our cat inside and safe from the neighbors - hmmm.)  The funny part of all of this is that I don't mind when the old lady just pops the animals down her throat.  Go figure.  In any case, Nadine Westcott is a good story teller and her artwork is clever, but I still have to give this book two stars because of the above reservations.          [A `Thought You Should Know' review 
 Given the build up for this book, I found it very disappointing. It completely ignores the fact that most American companies have failed in China -- precisely following the strategies the author advocated!  If you know very little about China, and have eaten at a Chinese restaurant a couple of times, this book should provide an easy introduction.  Otherwise, pass on it!  I would much rather recommend "New Asian Emperors:  The Overseas Chinese, their Strategies and Competitive Advantages" by George T. Haley et al. for a more complex understanding of business culture in the region 
 This is the worst movie ever made.  Except, maybe for Liar's Poker 
 I skimmed through the pages and found a description by the author of how to keep track of large jigsaw puzzles (paraphrased here):  Put the puzzle together, then flip it over and number each piece.  Then store it in a large Ziploc, along with a photo cut out from the box.  Then cut out a small photo from the box and put it in a three-ring binder....etc. First of all, who does a large puzzle more than once?  And how awkward is it to store a puzzle in a bag?  And how does one pick up a large puzzle?  This is not a useful book in my opinion 
 The book is for beginners.  It doesn't offer anything new or useful to experienced investors--women or men.  Waste of time 
 Just recently purchased the Thermometer and the clip does not hold the theremometer in place.  Paid $6.50 for item and $6.34 for shipping and was very displeased/upset with quality of the item. I thought the clip would hold the thermometer in the upright position so you could move the frothing cup in circular motion.  Thermometer falls over due to clip not tight enough on thermometer shaft.  
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 I feel I wasted my money when I purchased this one. I played it once, and decided there was no need to play it again. For me, it's an earache with few redeeming qualities. If I were younger and into wild music, it might be palatable. This one is destined for the trash 
 Although errors can seem obvious in some situations, some are not so obvious when the prose describe what is desired, but the code samples provided do not fit the bill.  Expect to spend some time determining if the code actually does what is described.  Download the code samples from the Wrox site and try it for yourself first (start with ch15 for a good example of ample carelessness).  Inconsistent conventions used throughout the book (naming private members of a class for example) also make it more challenging to follow the code samples.  There is also a large portion of the book dedicated to non-php-specific Coding House approaches to business.  Although several sections provide decent and accurate coverage, the book fails to provide a flow to the next section in most cases.  While reading, it is apparent when you have switched to a new author (since they do not follow the best practices presented earlier in the narrative).  If a proper review for errors and some rewriting to tie the sections together were performed, this book could improve, however, I cannot recommend it as is.  If you are not bothered when you skim the table of contents and spot page numbers (chapter 25) being misnumbered, then perhaps the various other errors throughout the book can be overlooked.  I would accept such errors in an online book under review - not from an established publishing house 
 This book illustrates basic exercises with very little real information. Arnold shows his bodybuilding routine which consists of training each bodypart three times per week twice a day, which would be extreme overtraining for anyone who  is not taking steroids. His dietary recommendations are outdated and primitive. This book is satisfactory for learning basic exercises so long as you disregard the training advice 
 Insurance companies are being ripped off every year for millions in order to pay for a therapy that does not work. Speech therapists need to be held accountable to the same degree that physicians are 
 Bob James - the mastermind of smooth Jazz. "H", "Touchdown", "Grand Piano Cannyon". Eternal pieces of Art. Brave and thoughtful new directions in Jazz. We owe him a lot. But the recent releases of Fourplay -including "X" - don't meet my expectations at all: predictable, repetitive, overproduced Computer-music. The typical Fourplay sound squeezed out like a lemon in another CD.  Larrys guitar playing takes a nice direction on "Tournabout" - but then the song falls back again to old routine. "Screenplay" is a good one (one of two songs that were done by Bob). The rest, hmm... some nice solos constricted in predictabiltiy. Don't get me wrong, I like all of the guys. Every single member of the group has done great things in the past.  So - a bit more breveness,  Yes Please 
 I bought this book because I need it for my His. class. From chap. # 1, I wanted to drop the class JUST BECAUSE THIS TBOOK.  Chapter 1: Referring to slaves and Native Americans "Within their own families and COMMUNITIES they made choices..."  My questions are  How many Slaves had choices??? What community of slaves?? Welcome to the Black Slave Community. The book is a joke  Slaves were not human for their owners. They were an expensive item. If the owner wanted to sell a Black baby, they were able to do it because the baby was the owner's property. The parents of this baby didn't have the "CHOICE" to say THIS IS MY CHILD. HE/SHE DOESN'T BELONGS TO YOU, SO YOU CAN NOT SELL HER/HIM. I think that this book and the authors do not respect Native Americans, African Americans and the history.  Also, the trade of Europeans with Native Americans . The book reads, "that the Indian was 'making sport of us Europeans.'" We, the people from America (the whole continent), lost everything we had in our trades. We didn't know the value of our gold, and we traded it for glass beads. So, What sport are we talking here? How this author want us to believe that we, people from America, fooled the Europeans 
 This ink has the ancient "iron gall" formula with its nifty aroma. Iron gall ink is waterproof but not safe enough for writing checks. Iron gall ink looks good from a "wet-writing" pen, but the lower-priced Lamy "Safari" and "Al-Star" pens are not "wet" enough. Also, you should never let iron gall ink dry out in a pen (permanent clogging!), and you should flush an iron-gall-using pen in both directions with plain water (pulling water in and forcing water out) every month or so 
 The cardboard shipping container for this bike was broken through and open in several places, which could have been the result of poor design of the packaging and/or inept handling by the shipping company.  A fender was bent and some of the paint was scratched.  The front brake was difficult to adjust because there did not seem to be enough wire.  A required tool, a 5mm allen wrench, was not provided. I have not attempted to adjust the gears because it seems too complicated, however, the bike seems to perform adequately as is. 
 if the cd is defective why amazon dont stop releasing this dvd and release A GOOD ONE WITHOUT THE DEFECTIVE CD and save customers EFFORTS TO GET THE GOOD ONE FROM WB???? i think its amazon RESPONSIBILITY to sell GOOD PRODUCT 
 i hate this book i really regret reading this book spending my money and my time.i thought it was going to be good as always cz its jane green but no definitly a BG NO 
 I wasn't expecting this book to somehow transform my sex life, but I certainly didn't expect the garbage I read. Yes, he makes some preaty good, but obvious observations. For example, "...when a man looks [at another woman], he needs to look appropriately." Or that a woman like to hear she's beautiful.  This is definitely a man writing  to an audince of women. There is some good advice here, but you have to be able to distinguish it from the nonsense. 
 Previously, I read the first two books of the His Dark Materials books with ease. They were easy to get into and the plots were more interesting. The third book is just a disgrace. I read the first couple of chapters and just could not say, "Oh, lets continue reading the Amber Spyglass." I practically had to "force" myself to read it, and eventually, I got tired of forcing myself to read it, so I decided to abandon it. There are three main keys that has led me to discontinuing this book. 1. The plot, the characters, the settings, etc. was just absolutely boring. There were no action-packed parts of the book in the beginning. And a major have-to-do thing for authors is to draw the readers in right from the beginning, and Mr. Pullman has not done that in this book. 2. This book is way too long. The combination of boringness(not a word, but oh well) and lengthiness is definitely not a good combination. 3. Why does PHilip Pullman have to be so against Christianity? I read his bio on wikipedia and he has all these critical comments on C.S. Lewis. It's okay for him to hate the religion, but others have the right to appreciate their own. He's also in these associations that are just so religious related. I just think he shouldn't show his hatred in his books 
 For the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars. I cringe whenever I see God's word taken out of context, changed, perverted, detracted from, or added onto, especially by men who are supposed to know better. In God's word He clearly gives His opinion on fictionalizing His holy book:  Revelation 22:18-19 "For I testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."  Proverbs 3):5-6 "Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar."  One way to be found a liar and receive God's rebuke is by fictionalizing (a dangerous form of adding onto God's word where He has not made us privy to His details and outcome of events) His words and prophecies. Fictionalizing the very last days before the Lord's return not wise, and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts--especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it. The authors of this series are treading on thin ice, simply shown by God's own words of warning in His book.  The authors have taken serious license in adding onto God's words in their Left Behind series, creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture. There are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series, even among its "Christian" characters, which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where God stands on these issues in His unchanging word. There are false representations of the Mark of the Beast that cannot be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it. The books also have a huge misrepresentation of the AntiChrist. He is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be.  At best, this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history Jesus said would be the worst ever. The authors have gone far beyond author's license. We just are not allowed to do this with the word of God.  I urge Christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the Lord promised you would be for reading the book of Revelation. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near." Revelation 1:3  He has told us what He wants us to know. We don't have the liberty to add onto it or change it 
 I bought this for my daughter's 1st birthday after seeing an ad for the entire set of Chicco Happy Garden products.  My daughter loves the Little Tikes set that is at her daycare and this looked similar but much cuter.  The eggplant has been a bit of a disappointment.  She would sit on it and rock for a few seconds at first but would quickly lose interest.  Now that we have had the eggplant for 3 months, it has been completely shoved aside.  It just doesn't rock much.  I can't imagine a child over 1 wanting to play with it.  The eggplant has very little curve to it and is pretty boring. I would stick to the Little Tikes set.   
 I have never received this product.  It has been sent to me in 4 separate shipments over the past 3 months and has never arrived.  Tracking the items indicates that the USPS receives it damaged and returns it to Amazon.  It's been very disappointing, inasmuch as I asked my friends to give me Amazon gift certificates for my birthday, so that I could buy it from Amazon.  It's now carried by Target, and I could buy it there, but Amazon won't turn my gift certificates into cash, so that I could use the cash to buy the items instead of waiting for it to arrive at my local post office damaged again.  I have re-ordered using my gift using my certificates again.  Let's keep our fingers crossed 
 This book is quite esoteric and very theory-based.  I was looking more for a book that would assist me in learning to use accupressure rather than understand it's development and philosophy. For anyone interested in a book that is more aimed at treatment, try Acupressure Potent Points: A Guide to Self-Care for Common Ailments by Michael Gach, an excellent resource 
 This book is very surprising in that the authors are seemingly 6 sigma experts and, yet, did not look for the root cause of the problem that they claim to have identified. If poor shareholder value is a problem (is it really? this is never shown), then complexity is either the solution or the symptom (the authors edge their bets) but... what is the root cause? Poor corporate culture, stupid management? Greedy and unenvolved senior leadership? What? By failing to probe for root causes the book remains very superficial and the solutions address symptoms,not root causes; a parallel would be for a doctor to keep prescribing headache medication to a brain cancer patient and never trying to find out what truly ails that patient. Six sigma practitioners should have known better and looked for root causes to the problem. The chapter on communication is particularly weak and comes across as an exercise of faux-science. The point is never clear: is it poor communication, too many decision layers (which may be unrelated to communication), poor information, what? The authors should have avoided a topic they know so little about (or should have learnt more about information theory). THis book comes across as superficial and as a bit of a pamphle 
 SHARP AND INSIGHTFUL.  A VERY SATISFYING LOOK BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF SECRECY THAT PREVAILS AT THE BUSH WHITEHOUSE 
 All I wanted was to have an easy-to-use vacuum for my studio apartment. So I got this one for it's cheap and good for bare floor. Yet it died off at the first time I used it-rather tried to use it. It was on just for 20 mins, not continuously though. I had already emptied the bag for two times and my back was virtually broken when I used it. Anyway, if anyone from the Euro-Pro is reading the reviews on this product, they should recompensate all of us because I believe marketing such a product is kind of abusing customers! Don't waste your money on this product 
 This author actually believes that she can tell you all about your life just by what age you are and she can predict what kind of story you will write, just by knowing your age.  Wrong!  There is also an entire section telling to basically quit your job, ignore your loved ones and devote yourself fully to becoming a millionare writing in Hollywood (which in reality, most of you will never make a penny doing).  This book is entirely unrealistic, but not because of the premise of the title.   What I do like about this book is she pushes you to quit procrastinating, gives good writing exercises, and gives you your basic outline without being too specific.  Not really the book I was looking for 
 These jeans were so very disappointing.  After hearing about PDC many times, I was excited to own a pair.  But these jeans were made of cheap, uncomfortable fabric and the style just doesn't work.  I won't be buying PDC again 
 Born Confused follows the life of the culture-confused main character, Dimple Lala.  Now I have to say, I know little about Indian cultures, but it seemed to me that Dimple didn't know so much herself. I do have experience with parents, of course, so her parents' reaction when she came home drunk was entirely unrealistic. My huge complaint is that the author portrays getting drunk and stoned as hilarious. The entire story, Dimple keeps saying how she never does anything wrong, but when her best friend says to drink or smoke marijuana she immediately does so, without question. God forbid if she had been told to do anything worse. Please, do not teach teens that smoking grass is a good thing. Is this author out of her mind???  Then, there was the friend, Gwynn, who was no friend at all. She was probably one of the most selfish characters I have ever come across, ex: taking her friend's clothes without asking, divulging her deepest secrets to a total stranger, who just so happens to be the boy she is after while her friend, Dimple, is sitting right there, she throws her best friend aside as soon as she gets a boyfriend, and when the time comes to apologize, she lays it all on Dimple's shoulders. If I had a friend like her I wouldn't stand that kind of treatment, but Dimple did. Even when she confronted Gwynn, nothing seemed to come of it, in my opinion. Dimple was a major pushover, and the ending, although everything is magically resolved in one year in the story, would not be in real life. Dimple was a kind, sympathetic character. She deserved a better friend and a backbone. Also, the author sometimes got carried away with descriptions...  At the moment, I'm having trouble remembering any good points. I think I liked it somewhat at the time I was reading it, but that feeling has left me completely.  Overall: another over-hyped book.  
 I've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips, activities, posters, etc.  However, I have also gotten endless emails from Mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance.  This continues though I asked them to stop.  For the last three or four weeks, they've been calling me on the telephone every day.  This continues though I asked them to stop.  The few good ideas in each $6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment 
 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 This is the second edition by Jim Hayes an instructor with Fiber U of "Instructors Guide to Fiber Optics Technicians Manual" WARNING You need the "other" manual issued in Feb 2000, not this one issued in March 2002 for the full 17 chapter overview 
 Mayhew comes to the earth-shaking conclusion that politicians want to be re-elected. Do you really need to read a book to tell you that -- give me a break! This was known by my grandfather who never attended school beyond the third-grade. Save your time and save your money 
 she is not a singer, she is not able to write, play and read the scores/Music. She is an entertainer! The problem is: you can't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today. Who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years? it is the same case like britney spears and spice girls!   PS: pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos!!!   Thank god for america's future pop artists like this one! 
 One would assume you would be getting six dishes as the picture shows six and the 4, 10 and 14 ounce versions come in packs of six.  However I only received one and had to call Amazon to correct this 
 Daughter loves the CD but Amazon took one month to deliver. That's unsatisfactory and I would have purchased elsewhere had I known 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 I have seen this online on other sites and in catalogs for $20 (not on sale either - regular price). Same siz 
 How do you spell 'sucks'? Easy - A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R!  I loved Stone's JFK, but this... Words fail me, but I'll try to find a few. Okay, the pros? Angelina Jolie. I've never been a big fan of hers, but, boy, was she the hottest woman alive in this movie! More pros? Hmmm. Certainly not the action sequences which were muddled and hard to follow. Certainly not the weird Irish accents the lead characters adopted. Certainly not the story.  This is just one of those films you believe can be so bad and that something cool is gonna happen the instant you hit the off button, so it stays your finger. My advice? HIT THAT BUTTON!  And I won't even mention the blonde wig! 
 Hurriedly churned out. Pop. Superficial. Still, fun in a sophomoric way. There are many ways one might find enlightenment, even by stubbing your toe. But, stubbing your toe is cheaper, and leaves a longer lasting impression. Beautiful cover art, though. Too bad it doesn't relate to the content 
 Nice compact box, and recording quality better than I expected.   One major flaw though, no preview when recording 640x480 resolution, just a black screen with 'REC' in the top corner.  Dropping back to 320x240 resolution doesn't help, this just displays the video preview in a tiny letter-box in the center of the display.  A real shame, I love the concept, but the lack of preview is a real problem.   Technical support claims that a future firmware upgrade will fix it, I'll keep my fingers crossed, but don't have high expectations 
 Maybe I was just expecting something like Jaws but I didn't think this movie that great. I watched it twice now only because I kept falling asleep the first time. The script is very weak and thus so is the story, the  acting is flat. Most of the shark sequences are in my opinion taken from  existing documentaries (I have seen photographs of at least one scene), you  can tell that they are cut into the movie and the parts that where done for  the movie are very poorly done. Don't waste your money, if you want to  watch it, rent it, don't buy it 
 What I find annoying about Leary's stand-up persona isn't the fact that he  so shamelessly rips  off the work of the late,great Bill Hicks but his  constant use of the term 'Irish Macho Guy' What?I'm Irish and I can say  with some certainty that we are not a nation  of 'macho guys'.At one point  Leary describes his father (an Irish Immigrant) as 'a real World War  II-John Wayne-Ted Williams kinda guy'.Ah, excuse me,Denis,but Ireland was  neutral during World War II.Do you know what that means?That means the  Irish didn't even FIGHT in WWII. Despite this though,there's the odd funny  line but,personally,I preferred Leary's 1997 show 'Lock 'N' Load 
  Don't get me wrong. The deck is great if you happen to be a Wiccan or follow a form of Paganism that is very Wiccan in style.  The problem is in the deck being advertised as good for all pagans.  With the cards referring to: The Maiden, Mother and Crone; The Threefold Law; The Words of the Magus; The Horned God and other concepts that are found only in Wiccan styled paganism it makes it as foreign to Germanic, Slavic, Celtic, Egyptian, Greeko-Roman and Middle Easter paganism as the decks the Well Worn Path was designed to replace. In fact in some cases more so! Especially when you count on Hermeticism connection to the Mediterranean faiths.  Other than this the deck is excellent. Just like many pagans from the not-Wiccan camps I'm tired of books, decks and articles trying to paint us all the same. It's becoming eerily like Fundamentalist Christian groups passing off non-denominational prayers turning control of our lives to 'our Father in Heaven, the most supreme God.' Then claiming it is appropriate for all faiths.  It's not that I have anything against Wicca, it's just of all the Pagan denominations it's adherents are the ones most likely to state that some aspect of there faith applies to all pagans and/or witches and anyone not following them isn't a REAL pagan/witch. This a trend I'm glad to see is dying down. 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 I purchased this toaster oven because I loved its exterior design and thought it would look great in my kitchen.  It did... until the middle knob came off after less than 6 months of use.  I've been using a pair of pliers to turn it on for the last 5 months while I await my replacement part.  I have followed-up on my request with DeLonghi customer service on a number of occassions and they offer no solution other than to continue to wait.  I even left a message with a supervisor and received no response whatsoever.  I vow to never buy a DeLonghi product again.  Still waiting for that knob.. 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money 
 This book is not for someone who just wants to pick up enough French to get them through a trip unless they have a good ear and memory.  I found "French in 10 Minutes a Day" much better as you must write what you learn in a workbook 
  There are just too many errors ,of interpretation,omission and commission,in this book to justify purchasing it.In this review we will concentrate on Rima's(R)handling of the work of J M Keynes.On p.84,R's claim that the Physiocratic concept of hoarding is "surprisingly suggestive" of J M Keynes's idea has no supporting evidence to back it up.On p.133,R claims that Malthus had developed a principle of effective demand,a la Keynes.What Malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and/or intuition that Ricardo's deductive,analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking(or assuming away)the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending.Nowhere does Malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to Ricardo.What Malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with Ricardo.In chapter 20 of R's book, she attempts to deal with Keynes's theory of effective demand and Keynes's discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory.Keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20,titled "The Employment Function".R should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book,replacing her chapter 20 with Keynes's chapter 20.R's Figure 20.1,discussed on pages451-454,directly contradicts Keynes's analysis 
 I detest this printer.  I've bought quite a few printers in my day:  Lexmark, Canon, and have been quite happy with most HP's, but this was the pits.  The first one I brought home worked fine the first time but when I tried to turn it on the next day, it wouldn't cut on.  It just died on me.  I unplugged it, plugged it back it...then it worked for a little while before dying again.  This time for good.  I returned it, got another one...same problem.  Except this time it keeps going.  All I have to do is unplug it before each and every time I turn it on.  Nice, huh?    Now I'm browsing online again and I've learned my lesson for sure.  No more el cheapo models.  I'm at least going to shell out for a midline price with some heft to it that will last me a year or two 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.  It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold...  I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.  The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic 
          I was reading this magazine at work, and I consider it to be a trashy magazine. It only focuses on the sexual part of women, like if sex is the best thing in the world, because they had this article in which a girl was riding a taxi, and she thought the taxi guy was fine, so she unbutton her shirt and told the taxi guy to touch her breasts. And then she says it was the *best experience she ever had. I just cant believe they publish garbage like that, giving the message to women that its ok to undress yourself with a total stranger, who you dont even know. I prefer to read things that focus more on the inner heart, on the emotional, and spiritual side of things. And read books that will help me be a better person right now and the future, and throw away the garbage this society has 
 Reading this book was hard work,and pretty irritating to get through. It is written by an Englishman and is strictly for English audiences. Practically every page contains slang, colloquialisms and references to people, places, and things that have no meaning to Americans at all. The writing style is also confusing, going back and forth with the subject at hand so you constantly have to go back to figure out who said what about who when etc. NOT a pleasant read. I am a great Peter Green fan so I muddled through. The author is obviously not a musician either,  not very insightful commentary on music or musicians. Lots of anecdotal hero worship, which according to Peter's history and interviews is exactly what he does not want.  Hard to believe this is the authorised biography 
   A trouble some pooch who has reaccuring dreams of being something else, something far greater.... A man. After a series of silly events he begins to take these dreams seriously and goes off on an adventure to find his family and his old life before..... HE DIED.   While the story is very touching and has a very good moral too it it was far too too long for me and seemed kinda cheesy at some pionts they kept on reinfasizing reincarnation, reincarnation, reincarnation. It was interesting but at one piont it became very boring and I lost intrest. I have only been able to sit through it one time, because of this. It jusy seemed like the man was really in a coma and that at one piont that he was gonna wake up from this long boring nightmare but he never did.   A great move to show small children at bed time so they fall asleep and perhaps people with a long patience or perhaps people with  an intrest in animals and dogs would like to see it 
 I don't get the politics of Tony Bennett saying "yes, dear" to KD Lang at the end of the 1st number, but sad to say, the whole album seems an overproduced mistake, including sappy saxophone interludes and treacly high-pitched violin countermelodies.  I love sax.  I mean, I love saxophones and saxophone players as if they were part of my family.  But someone has got to stop this easy listenin' moony-waily lushly lackadaisical sinuous syrupy "smooth jazz" exploitation of just one tiny, embarrassing aspect of the saxophone's otherwise terrific character.  But I doubt the small-minded no-talents who produced this album would ever get the drift.  Note to Word Lovers:  "Treacle" originally meant "a medicinal compound formerly in wide use as a remedy against poison."  However, Tony and KD got suckered into singing on an album that's practically poisonous itself 
 Now that the author has a little fame, he has re-released this dog of a book.  It is very disjointed and one of the worst books I have ever had the displeasure to read 
 Broke after 5 days.  I used it the way it was meant to be used, cleaned it nightly, etc, I had read a review that said theirs broke after a short time and ignored it.  I wish I hadn't, this is junk 
 Prince has made some fabulous music the past 25 years or so. But this album, Come, is his weakest one.  The songs are bad, Letitgo was the only good song here, and the funk is seriously lacking here.  It was one of his last albums for Warner Bros. Records, but I can tell that his relationship with them went sour. They were supportive during his Purple Rain era, but later disintegrated long after that.  Fortunately, Musicology is selling like crazy now, which makes this 1994 album completely forgettable. Save your money and get his latest one, Purple Rain or 1999 instead.  Even Prince could say himself that this album sucked! 
 It's quite funny to see people rave about the beautiful "Hedwig's Theme" melody.  Yes, it was beautiful when Tchaikovsky composed it 150 years ago as the Andante from his ballet "Swan Lake."  Williams shamelessly copied the melody for his "Hedwig's Theme".  I'm a little astonished that the producers let this plagiarism slip by, but perhaps they're still waiting for spine donors.  Williams also steals other music from himself as well as classical composers for this score.  It's a shame that once he hit his sixties he can't be original anymore.  Or maybe it's Alzheimer's disease and he just can't remember that someone else wrote it first.. 
 The Astronaut's Wife, starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron was a major disappointment. My husband and I have what we call the 30-Minute Rule when it comes to watching DVD's. Since our spare time is so limited, if we are not completely engrossed in the movie at the end of 30 minutes, we stop and put something else on.  I'm sorry to say that The Astronaut's Wife did not make it past the 30-Minute rule. In fact, I found myself watching the timer, wishing the minutes would go by faster so we could find a better way to waste our time.  The first thing is, the movie is slow. Very, very, very slow. There are lots of camera angles on Charlize Theron looking thoughtful, Charlize looking pensive, Charlize looking worried, Charlize looking scared, Charlize looking sad- well, you get the idea. Everything seems to happen as though we are watching it through a very long tunnel-- noises are slightly muted and have an "out-of-body" sound to them.  Even Johnny Depp is not enough to save this movie. The feeling I generally get when watching Johnny Depp in a role is that nobody else could have played that part because he makes it so much his own. In this instance, however, I can think of a dozen different actors who could have played the part, and we wouldn't have noticed the difference.  If you must watch it, put it on fast forward and read the subtitles. That way you'll get it over with faster. 
 We are very disappointed in the peformance of this toaster. The bread will toast good on the inside but barley on the outside. I sent email to West Bend and was told the maybe the bagle switch was stuck--no help.  If I return it, shipping cost makes it not worth it. Good appearance and Company name fooled me. FY 
 Elmore Leonard is one of the more respected of popular contemporary authors, and deservingly so.  He has a wonderful ear for dialogue and the impressive ability to both generate plot and develop characters through it.  What many authors may describe in several paragraphs or pages, Leonard does in a few lines of dialogue.  As such, his books are tremendously quick and enjoyable reads.  However, 'Be Cool' is not one of his best.  The concept is interesting enough: a sequel.  And not just that, but a sort of metafictional work poking fun at the whole idea of sequels.  Chili Palmer returns, trying to get his foot in the door of the music industry.  As always, the protagonist is surrounded by an odd assortment of hitmen, cons, and scattered goofballs.  However, when reading 'Be Cool' I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was rushed.  Many of the character (the cop, the gangsta rapper) are scarcely developed at all (the latter, in particular, could have been a rich source of satire).  Also, the ending seemed rushed, as well.  Leonard seemed to be racing towards it without building up much tension.  The reader reaches the last page and wonders what was the point of the second half of the book.  I'd always recommend Elmore Leonard as a quick, enjoyable, "beach" read.  However, go with something else of his instead of 'Be Cool. 
 I agree with michel that there are a lot of mistakes in the book. It is good for the questions but NOT for the answers. 
 I was pleased to get the DVD as I have been trying to get it for teaching Greek Mythology, but I thought the actual packaging of the DVD rather poor especially for transferring to and from my class. The disc is not properly protected in my opinion

 We all know that Cyndi Lee is a guru in the industry.  So, I was very disappointed that she chose not to use actual photos to depict poses and correct postures, but rather line art 
 Amie:"I would say this book is a little less than average. I enjoyed the book Angel Medicine much more. The Angels seemed so much more peaceful and loving in her previous books which makes me think they are merely a projection of what the author is feeling at the time. Are they angels or inner thoughts and how can one really tell?"    I have reason to believe they are far more tilted towards herself than angels.  Whether reading this book or going to her site angeltherapy.com you will find a community message board where anything that you write that does not support her position, she or her admin team will immediately and high handedly delete.  I've seen postings on this site that says if you question her or her affiliates the admin will take you down.  Now consider the topic of this book & what she is writing about.  Thats not exactly Angelic, is it?  The reason I mention her site on angeltherapy.com is because you clearly see further evidence of what Amie says --  That the writings come far more from her than from Angels.  Why include all this on Amazon.com?  Very simple!  A genuine message from Angels is something I myself would like to read.  Having explored the evidence I really dont think this book is as much Angelic communication as much as it is Doreen communication.  If your looking for Authentic Angelic communication you may have to look this book over a little more carefully 
 Did anyone have any idea there was a Ram Jam song that wasn't called Black Betty?  The likliness of you knowing it was about the same as hitting a traffic jam on I-355 circa the 2PM hour.  Ram Jam sucks.  Black Betty however is amazing but one song does not make a band.  This album should be Black Betty, 20 times 
 This is perhaps the most disappointing King book I have ever read (and considering that I have read "Desperation" and "Insomnia" that is saying a lot).  The storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story.  I have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top.  The only thing I found interesting about King as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book.  I thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book.  I would guess that anybody that reaches Song of Susannah has read is a faithful reader of King and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works (which as of late have been bad with the exception of "The Green Mile:  Hey, Steve, if I wanted to read an infomercial I'll read my junk mail.  I cannot wait to read the last Dark Tower book so I can be put out of my misery 
 I thought I'd try this book because I enjoyed both of the films about Ripley. But take away the acting of Matt Damon and John Malkovich and Ripley loses his depth as a fascinatingly ambiguous amoralist, and turns into just a bore in a dressing gown who happens to kill a lot of people. Furthermore, Highsmith seems to have only one literary trick up her sleeve: describe a bunch of horrific acts in deadpan, Hemingwayesque prose so that your reader can shiver and marvel at the incongruity of it all. Well, ho hum 
 I cannot for the life of me understand how this thing ever found a publisher.  The prose is flat and insipid; the characters unexciting and drab; the pace leaden.  Reading this is slightly less exciting than watching paint dry.  The author has done some historical research and can't just use it; where he pops in an historical detail he elbows you in the ribs to draw attention to his cleverness.  I had a very hard time dragging myself to the end of this book (first one by Mallon I have read) and would not recommend it 
 Very basic book that covers no new ground.  Go to your local library and find a fitness/weight lifting book.  You won't miss anything by taking this route and passing on this relatively useless book.  
 I saw this book in the book store the other night and almost bought it.  Norman Jewison was on the TCM documentary of Steve McQueen, seemed like a nice guy with some fascinating stories, and I thought it would be interesting to read about his career and all the celebrities he has worked with.  I thumbed through the book, reading bits and pieces.  On the back cover was a praising review from Gore Vidal - Strike 1.  Below that was a praising review from Cher - Strike 2.  Inside was a picture of Jewison with Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas - Strike 3.  Not to mention the book states John Wayne supposedly called Jewison a "pinko Canadian."  Also not to mention a few other things I found offensive.  I put the book back on the shelf, kept looking and wound up buying "Capote," about the life of Truman Capote.  He was a Southerner, a writer, hob-nobbed with the rich and famous, and on the back book cover it said he had a feud with Gore Vidal.  Home run. 
 A well-acted, well-portrayed, sickening, overt example of an adult whose sole desire for a child is based on getting that child to meet his own selfish needs.  He has little or no love for the child based on who the child is in her core, and sends her the basic message that she does not count as a human being aside from being an object to gratify him.  If the child does not mold to his expectations and desires she gets rejected, and this is the horrible tension of the movie.  Although the movie has some twists and turns that shake things up, the man's character never develops much in a satisfying way, and nor do the basic themes of adult selfishness and cultural repression.  As such the movie is essentially non-redemptive, and portrays a sad and tragic side of humanity.  Although this movie is set in an outer province on China in the 1930s, it's actually a good metaphor for Western culture, much as Western cultural norms do not allow parents to exploit their children so overtly.. 
 When Longwave released Strangest Things, they got a fantastic production sound and had a great batch of songs. I saw them live and, while the show was energetic and respectable, I would hardly call it the "best live show around" as the previous reviewer suggests. Shannon Ferguson *is* a talented and inventive guitarist and gets good sound live. However, anyone who compares Longwave to Ride never saw Ride play live. That's like comparing a Perry Como show to the Clash, circa 1978. But I digress. Unfortunately, the sound on this EP, and the first two tracks in particular is muddy and very disappointing. The vocals on "Life of the Party" sound as though they were recorded underwater!  Steve Schiltz has a good voice, so it's puzzling why they'd want to mess with the sound this much. Perhaps they're hoping to hide the lack of substance behind layers of "style". I expected big things and growth from Longwave and bought this EP without hearing it.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  If you really want to hear some cool sounds out of NYC these days, check out Ambulance Ltd. or Robbers On High Street, or just wait for the new Interpol CD. Longwave's rhythm section has recently jumped ship, and so has this fan 
 Had to stop about 1/4 of the way through it and give it away 
 Purchase this only if you have a minute idea of what a computer is.  This is very elementary and assumes you have absolutely no knowledge of what a network even is. It doesn't go any further than that either.  Don't expect that you will be learn how to network computers together (my expectation); only that you will learn what components are involved --but not how they work or how to actually network them. I don't mind basic info, but this book should be titled "Network Equipment Descriptions for Dummies" certainly not it's current title. Way too many jokes as well (more annoying than entertaining) 
 Disappointed with the written content. Too much irrelevant, adolescent street jargon.  Illustrations were poor as were the written descriptions of techniques. Overall a disappointing buy 
 The Songlines is unfortunately two books in one and they do not really gel.  Each separately would of received more stars.  It starts quite well as a narrative of his time in Alice Springs and the aboriginal culture he explored.  This is very readable and quite educational (and would of scored 4 -5 stars).  Unfortunely at about halfway through books he starts putting in little quotes in sequence often for 20 - 30 pages which interupts the story line of the other 'book'.  He really should of pulled the quotes out and built them into a second novel.   In the end though the book became a struggle to read because it no longer flowe 
 This was one of the few books I just could not get through. Managed about 2/3 and just gave up. At least to the point where I called it quits, the plot was just goofy. 
 This was just a regirgitation of all the other drivel written about her. Author should be ashamed to take his royalty check! We all know the little stories-heck, we could have dug them up online! Not much depth here. He makes veiled comments about Kelly and her life, but only goes so far. VERY DISAPPOINTIN 
 SO this is the winner of PLOP idol from the U.K then.  Well they don't come prettier than this from Scotland I guess, that's for sure.  As far as the music is concerned, AVOID!  It's nothing but a calchony of crap.  Perhaps Michelle should stick at something she is good at - eating chips and mars bars 
 I am currently taking this course at my College, it is a "Course in a Box" type course that is on 9 DVD's and this is the companion book.  Never mind that the course DVD's are very boring and are from 1989, yeah, 1989; but this study guide uses very large/high level words so it does not read smoothly.  I have to sit with a dictionary in my lap and look up about 5 words per page.  My point is the book is unnecessarily difficult to read and the Media is boring.  
 I was so excited when I ordered my Star Wars Holographic Emperor figure. I'd been waiting for this exclusive figure be available for weeks!! When I got home today, the box with the Amazon logo was on my doorstep. Upon opening the box, I was completely disappointed to find that the Emperor figure I'd been waiting for was damaged since it was jammed into the box so that the backing card was crushed. The people packing this stuff are half-wits!! Anybody with a brain would know better than to  cram something into a box like that!! They should be ashamed of their service & to all you collectors out there....BEWARE!! 
  I purchased this book to read on a scuba diving trip in eastern Indonesia over Christmas and was very disappointed (I should have read the online reviews before I did).  While the subject matter is fascinating, and a large part of the narrative engaging, much too much time is spent by the author digressing into his often unrelated personal experiences during his travels around the world, name dropping those in his profession, inserting strained literary references and generally telling the reader endless amounts of useless information.  Admittedly, in Chapter 1 the Author tells the readers that "where my own experiences with people or places will serve to bring the process of investigation alive then I shall make diversions, the better to illuminate the way forward."  This sounds great in theory and a valid alternative to dry, impersonal prose.  The problem is that these many, many diversions provide no illumination at all on the subject matter (or the way forward), and they make much of the book read like a bad travelogue, with the author telling us he's in London or Oman or China or somewhere else and how fascinating or wonderful his trip is, such as a conference in Wales where we are told during a dinner he "sat next to a jolly professor of Celtic languages who explained the bardic tradition to me."  How does this possibly illuminate anything remotely related to natural history?  A few such diversions are tolerable or even folksy, but unfortunately they are never ending in this book.  In addition, the work suffers from an appalling lack of tables, maps, charts, diagrams and similar visual information that would help the reader better understand the subject matter.  Instead, the book contains pictures of such things as (and I'm not making this up) a row of slot machines in a Las Vegas casino and the tablecloth used during teatime by Lady Smith Woodward.  If you want a good book on the natural history of the Earth, keep shopping. 
 Or at least not what I was looking for...but based on all the other reviews here, I thought it was.  This book has a very limited audience in mind, namely those who are giving "speeches", not just regular, everyday presentations and meetings.  The name of the book is deceiving, and so are the reviews.  The first chapter is the only one that is moderately worthwhile if you're actually looking for tips on becoming more confident.  Otherwise, it is simply a laundry list of ways to give big speeches; not helpful at all to the average joe who works in corporate america and just wants to feel more confident.  I realize this is difficult to teach in a book, but the other reviewers gave the impression that I might garner some tidbits on this.  
 I don't doubt that UFO's exist, but this book is a sorry excuse for what the title promises: The real story of unidentified flying objects. It seems to me that the author is jumping to conclusions.. 
 I bought this book with high, but nervous expectations.  I was looking forward to seeing how this book had been "revised and updated" for the 21st century.  What I found was a terrible hatchet and cut-and-paste job on Napoleon Hill's classic book. The editor, Arthur Pell, completely destroys the rhythm and flow of Dr. Hill's ideas by inserting contemporary examples at the end of Hill's chapters.  It's a travesty.  We don't need a "21st century version" of "Think and Grow Rich." The one that has worked so well all these many years is still the best.  If someone wants to publish a 21st century book, they should simply write an entirely new one.  Even minor revisions of a classic like "Think and Grow Rich," to eliminate outdated language or correct errors, should be undertaken with the utmost care and respect for the original.  When the project is over, it should still be Napoleon Hill's book. 
 These batteries didn't last at all. They worked OK in my remote control for my radio, but on everything else, the quality was either below-average or just horrid. My digital camera didn't even turn on with these. Only recommended with low powered devices; actually I'd recommend a Rayovac or an Energizer rather than these. I know they're only heavy duty batteries, but the quality is still below-average 
 This book is very difficult to read. The sentences are so long that you will struggle to make sense of them. The author goes out of his way to use long complicated words. This is not a good book to read to introduce yourself to the subject 
 Falling in Love is one of my favorite scents ever.  It's basically my go-to fragrance for everyday.  If you're a fan of this scent you already know it's really pretty but very light.  That's why I was exited about the solid for touch-ups on the go.  Let me tell you, subtle is an understatement for this product. When I opened the seal and held it under my nose I could hardly smell it.  When I applied it (generously) to my wrist the scent was barely detectable.  I rubbed my wrists together to gently warm the perfume and it didn't help at all.  I expected this to be fairly concentrated so that little dabs would suffice.  Very disappointing.  
 i am completely and utterly baffled by this movie, but more so by the people who are giving it five stars. once again, it is proven that amazon reviewers only review things that they like. and for some reason, there are people who liked this. i'll admit that the movie has its good qualities - christina ricci is one of my favorite actresses and this film wasn't bad enough that i will hold it against her, some of the acting was charming, it had a few clever scenes and i just liked the look of a lot of it. BUT as for the important traits of a good movie - the plot was incredibly under-developed as was the script and the transitions just didn't seem to fit, almost too the point of my asking "are they TRYING to make this not make sense?" and it's overall just unrealistic. i'd watch it again, sure, but that says nothing about the film 
   I can't agree with . Shih "M.Smith"'s review even more. I just can't stand the arrogance tone shown in this book. I got a feeling that the authors simply don't like the progress in China. It seems like the authors are simply trying to minimizing the progress China made and relishing the problems China has.   I seriously doubt the authors ever read any Chinese sources or talk to any Chinese scholar. The authors seem to imply that if the Chinese to follow the American way, then they will never succeed. True, China has a tons of problems. But the Chinese leaders and Chinese people are trying their best to solve them. What annoys me is that some of these authors seem to relish over the fact that China has so many problems  You won't get that much new info about China in this book. Yea, China has tons of problems. Who doesn't know. The authors are trying to answer the most complex questions of China with simplistic answers. 
 It would be easy to dismiss a book that teaches that dinosaurs and human beings were contemporaries. However, as the last laugh may be with the millions who find themselves in sympathy with that view, it would be wise to give this book closer study.  "D is for Dinosaur" is the desperate cry of a person of faith attempting to reconcile the unharmonious realities of a literalist interpretation of the Bible and an earth full of the fossils.  As a person of faith myself, as well as one who believes in the findings of science, I can only shake my head at some of the assertions put forth in the book. A sampling: -	All animals were vegetarians in the garden of Eden - even dinosaurs clearly built for predation -	Noah was able to take small and very young dinosaurs with him on the Ark -	Fossils are the result of animals (including dinosaurs) killed in the Noahic flood -	Tales of dragons are based on actual encounters between humans and dinosaurs -	The earth is only about 6,000 years old  Like many good religious education books, this one is colorful and fun, and even has a section for parents and teachers. It was here that I came across some of the absurdities that undergird the book. On page 70, students are taught to challenge their biology teachers. If the teacher says that such and such an animal lived 25 million years ago, the child is supposed to respond with "Were you there?" This is supposed to reduce the teacher to blithering, as shown in the illustration of flop-sweating instructor. However, that the question could also be turned back on the author. "You say that dinosaurs lived in the Garden Eden. Were you there?"  The problem here is really one of epistemology - how we know what we know. If Ham's approach won out, we would be reduced to accepting only events that we had personally witnessed. We could not believe that our parents had been children, or that the Civil War had actually occured. We would not be able to believe that places we had not visited existed. The entire basis of science, technology and communication would fall apart. Perhaps this book has value for this reason alone: to help us understand the basis for our own beliefs, and thereby guide us to strengthen our arguments. That knowledge will come in handy on the day the literalists come to our towns to push their semi-logical views.  I admire Ham, after a fashion, for having the courage to put his beliefs into words and pictures and expose them to public scrutiny. I don't accept his thesis, of course, or his assumptions about knowledge. Believers must find ways to harmonize the two great sources of truth in contemporary life: Scriptures and Science. This book should be a warning to all who love the Bible and science, and a primer for combating those who feel they must subvert one on behalf of the other 
 Driving physics are as unrealistic as they can get.  Obtaining licenses is extremely difficult, made worse by poor car physics.  Your heavy car easily bounces off light cars, while light cars easily derail your heavy car.  Turning the steering wheel only slightly produces heavy tire squeal, and that's with sports tires!  Long gone are the ESPN-like replays of GT 2.  For some reason cars look thinner than before.  The analog tachometer has been reduced to just a bar across the screen.  The 3D mechanics can be headache prone, made worse by the poor physics of the cars.  Easily the most inadequate music ever.  The game makes you start with a used model of only certain makes, which is nothing new.  However, it takes a long time to earn any money for a better car.  Only 7 horsepower upgrades make huge differences on the track?!  The game has mostly only newer models, almost none from a few years ago, unlike in GT 2.  The only good thing about this game is that you don't have to drive all the time.  The B-Spec driving mode can win races for you.  Just leave for a few minutes and return to a victory screen.  This can help in skipping the painful, early parts of the game.  The powertrain is still not modifiable.  Compression, bore, stroke, camshaft timing/overlap, valve size, and other engine characteristics are still not available.  With poor driving physics, engine modification would not have helped this game.  Loading times are very long, with the most annoying loading indicator ever.  Constant auto saving feature is quick but can become annoying.  There is an excessive amount of confirmation screens.  This game is a yet another disappointment, much like GT 3 was.  The makers of this game made it quite clear that if you want to know what the real cars drive like, you will have to drive them for real.  The Gran Tourismo series are over, unlikely to return to what they used to be.  I'm not a racing game fan, but only GT 2 was good enough for me to buy.  If you want good, car make-independent physics, you need to play Gran Tourismo 2. 
 Having read several novels by this author, and having been delighted with his characteristic use of language, I picked up this novel from the library.  To say I was disappointed doesn't begin to describe the boredom I suffered while forcing myself to finish this book. Far too many pages are taken up with philosophical dialogue between characters whose voices are nigh indistinguishable.  While I enjoy improbable stories, deus ex machina plot twists remain distasteful to me.   If you're still interested in this book, get it from the library before you invest.  
 It's not easy to criticize this book, because it is beautifully written and captures something tragic and poignant and important:  the emotional trials and conflicts of a spunky twelve year old girl who is coming of age in a world that doesn't understand her.  But McCullers' darker undercurrents taint the book.  Threaded throughout are elements of sexual perversity, terrible sexual boundaries with children, and hints at pedophilia, leading me to question strongly what in the world happened to Carson McCullers when she was a little girl.  Furthermore, the perversity often pops up in a disjointed way that adds nothing to the book's power, and thus reads largely as gratuitous.  A few examples from the book - a book which I did not finish because I didn't trust where its author was taking me:  1) The main character, a pubescent twelve year old girl who is nearly five-foot six, has spent her whole life up till now sleeping in the bed with her widowed and single father, until he looks at her one day and realizes she's "a great big long-legged twelve year old" - McCullers leaves exactly what he means to our imagination - and kicks her out of bed.  2) The girl's best friend is a six year old boy, whom she bullies and torments, and then basically forces to spend the night with her in her bed.  McCullers makes a point of showing how they change their clothes for bed in the same room - "with their backs turned to each other" - and then get in bed together.  Once the little boy is asleep the girl, who is two months away from turning thirteen, rubs his bare stomach with her hand, licks him behind his ear, and then nuzzles up to him.  (Also, imagine if their genders were reversed!)  3) The father takes a married couple as boarders in the house, but the girl - then age nine - walks in on them doing something overtly sexual with the door left purposefully open.  McCullers leaves it to the readers' imagination what her little protagonist viewed.  4) McCullers talks about the girl character, age twelve, having had sex with a neighborhood boy.  Again, she gets vague on details, but why is she sharing even this much?  If you were to remove the literary style and add a scant few more details, you would have child pornography.  5) Eventually the girl changes her name, wears an adult dress that makes her look much older - and goes out on the town and meets a visiting adult soldier.  He comes onto her sexually - though stops only because others come into the bar where he is giving her alcohol.  One is only left to wonder where the book will go from here.  Because this book was written in the 1940s the author can get away with it - and perhaps also because she's a female author - but really, it's disturbing and perverse 
 Plain Truth, set in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, would be better entitled, Fancy Lies. An eighteen-year-old Plain woman wakes up with labor pains, gives birth in a calving pen, cuts the umbilical cord and prays, "Lord, please make this go away." When she awakens and the baby is no longer with her, she whispers, "Denke," and goes on with her day. Later, after the deceased body of an infant is found and the police are called to investigate, she tells them "I didn't have a baby," as blood trickles down her leg. Without providing spoilers, two (of many) implausible situations follow. First, two women, one old, one young, both separately become pregnant through one act of intercourse, defying the odds of fertility. Second, a criminal defense attorney who made a name for herself getting an acquittal for an elementary school principal who molested six students is actually very maternal and willingly leaves big city life with a boyfriend of eight years to live on an electricity-free farm out of the kindness of her heart. In summary, a two-page italicized section mid-book along with the first and last chapters provide enough details of the basic plot to save the reader from 400 implausible pages. Those interested in reading just one book by Jodi Picoult should choose My Sister's Keeper. Chris Bohjalian's Midwives is better. 
 A cool lady I call the Rockchick loaned me this ep; I listened. Man, o, man, this stuff could put trees to sleep.  I told the Rockchick that it sounded like these guys were serenading angels and not people that live on earth.  If you're 15-19 and still have all your hopes and dreams about meeting mr. or ms.right-- get this syrupy ep.   Otherwise, listen to Kasabian or the Dandy Warhols...music that rocks even as it moves all over the place spilling cheer and sonic radiation 
 No new material, just a recap of things already seen.  A complete waste of money.  Interestingly, the description on the back was exactly the same as vol.2 .  Maybe they were trying to send a warning.  If you can find a way to get your money back, do so 
 It's a mediocre tax law outline--simply put. Buy it used, if at all.  
 This book is mostly fluff about what to expect at the doctors and how to react to the questions and concerns of your doctor.  The test in the beginning of the book talks about various things you should do and not do when going to the hospital.  One of the answers is that you should remove your nail polish, another refers to your husband, instead of spouse.  Dr. Roiszen is obviously preaching to only the female segment of the patient market.  He also mistakenly implies that drug salespersons, known in the trade as "detail" salesman, only give him a little token gift and states that they provide a service which he compares to the neighborhood pharmacist.  Buy the book of its information, but read it with an open mind. 
 At about a 5th grade reading level, this book does a decent job in explaining the basics of chemical reaction engineering.  Way too many typos in it, however, and that really annoys me.. 
 I ordered the ants in December (Christmas present), and although the temperatures were unseasonably warm here throughout January, no ants arrived. I have called several times, with the same excuse. They have my money and won't deliver the ants. I would suggest any other company besides Uncle Milton Industries 
 Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version.  (For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM) 
 "I am an honest seller and I insure 100% satisfaction to my customers.  I can also ship out a better quality beanie visor hat for you.    Please withdraw the feedback:" -JTF Trading  Don't bother. I bought a better product from OldGlory. The feedback stays. People should know what they are buying. -Me  "Not a problem.  1 feedback doesn't hurt us at all because all of our other customers know about our products and our excellent customer service." -JTF Trading  Well, I guess all I can do is you "other customers" know what a POS this hat was. That, and I had the hassle of this guy emailing me after I thought I made it clear that the matter was closed.   Try OldGlory for a better deal and a better product 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 This book is certainly a very traditional and classical coverage of Protestant ecclesiology. It encourages the community-aspect of Protestant Christianity over the tendency towards modern individualism, which sometimes leads to the question of why Church is even necessary, etc. Major reference that most everyone will recognize is German theologian Karl Barth.  This is indeed a call back to the more traditional form of communistic Protestantism, and for this it ought to be applauded. Nevertheless, even this book is far off from original Christianity in all of its glory. Whereas Protestantism was a movement towards more spirituality and less bureaucracy (thus misbalancing Christianity slightly, though Catholicism can be blamed for the exact same thing), this is just seemingly a call towards more bureaucracy and less spirituality. However, it does cover its topic well, and the spirituality aspect of things is not even claimed to be covered, so the author is without fault. Just keep in mind that original apostolic Christianity was the perfect balance of government and spirituality, so as to move towards the salvation of souls; this book does not offer the answer to moving closer to that original Christianity.  And in regards to why I gave this book only two stars: In the spirit of its locally communistic message, it kind of staged an attack on America. Not in the tradition of radical Islamists, mind you, but more in the manner of a dry shrug and indifference towards American sovereignty, and the very concept of financial liberty, etc. One main example I give for this: This book criticizes Ronald Reagan for criticizing certain Churches that had policies or at least preached against nuclear defense, in favor of nuclear disarmament. In doing so, the author indifferently throws out one of the most phenomenal Christian Americans (and a Protestant at that) ever. To focus on such a small detail that may or may not have been negative in Reagan's campaign, while ignoring all of the phenomenally charitable things he did for us all, is selfish and ridiculous.  Moreover, as I have said, this book is indeed polemical, and in a kind of viciously biased way. You will not find both sides in this book expressed very well. What you will find is a simplistic explanation of Gnostic belief, what you will not find is a very decent representation of Reagan's Christianity (which is actually not very traditional in the ecclesiological aspect), or even of the most traditional forms of Christianity (Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism), from which even Philip Lee's form of Protestantism is still a great deviation 
 i really like douglas coupland, but i didn't like this novel it is the only one though the rest are all 4 or 5 stars 
 I look at the average raiting for this movie. # stars, now thats supposed to mean its ok. Well ppl, this plotless load of junk is getting more than it deserves. I read some review saying the musicwas good, and, well, from my perspective It seemed like the music was played at entirely random moments. Like it could skip from a fight scene to a dramatic we feel sorry for darkman moment, and i would almost barely knotice, if it wasnt for stupid clips they play of images that make no sense. It was like they didnt know what to show so they figured this is kinda how he feels so lets just put this here. Save your money. I bought this after seeing the first, which was lame, but i though it was ok, and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something. Well this was in 6th grade. HUGE mistake i hated it when i first saw it. It seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it. And about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play. Good, considering its live, but lame as far as movies get.  Oh, and the villians who were supposed to seem smart or truly evil, just seemed spiteful and annoyingly upsessed with killing. I really think this is one of the most absolutely stupid films ever made. But that was untill I saw reptillian. Which is kinda depressingly awfull 
 I have read over 30+ books on self development and this was another addition to my library. Title looked very promising so I bought this one.   Very well written and presented in recipe book format.  It tells you what is a 'Theory' and what you need to do.   Step 1 is the step and most important step for anyone is to clearing your mind from negative thoughts and that is a challenge.   It wants you to clear your house physically but what about clearing and suppressing your emotions and so clearing your mind.   It never worked for me as how can you cheat your mind and thing positively and greatly about little pains in your life like health issues or bills or recurring losses in business and still ignore the thought and let it go ?..  How can you let the thought of recurring financial loss go from your mind when you know you still have to pay that bill ??..    Part I wants you to get rid of those negative thoughts but hey.. let's face the reality.  Who is going to pay this bill?.  Who is going to suffer?.   It is hard to let go of thoughts and fool yourself when you are experiencing the pain every day, many times in a day, perhaps every moment.  Is that a Real You??...     I am not sure how genuine these reviews are or they are written by those who are just "fascinated by the thought that they found a great book", which works in (only ) theory but not in reality.   These principles never worked for me as if nothing works if Step I does not work.  Step I is basically 'Fool yourself and think Great, no matter what happens'  Great book but mostly impractical and it does not work .     
 Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does. 
 This book is bad stuff because it doesn't emphasize eternal damnation in Hell.  Without Hell and eternal damnation, God did not have to take on human flesh to die in a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.  John Stott really needs to read his Bible carefully.  How could someone who doesn't understand this be saved? 
 A catalyst for the civil war, Uncle Tom's Cabin gives vivid details on the living conditions of the black slaves. The book's literary worth lies in the fact that people can make a difference by speaking out, and by preserving a kind of fictional history of the African American's pain, despite being redundant, rube and rife with tautology. The story is about Tom, a slave who saves his master's daughter and is promised his freedom. But his master dies before Tom is actually freed. The family falls upon hard times and Tom is sold to a horrible slave owner named Simon Legree. Legree tried everything to degrade Tom, but Tom holds firmly to his religious convictions. 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 THIS BOOK IS FAR TOO BIASED TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  THROUGHOUT THE BOOK IT APPEARS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS AN AXE TO GRIND AND MAKES IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT RUDY IS NOT ONE OF HIS FAVIORITE PEOPLE.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A BOOK ABOUT MAYOR GUILIANI THAT IS WRITEN BY SOMEONE WHO PRESENTS MORE BALANCE 
 I consider large parts of this book as just a re-hash of earlier works by this author. If you know the earlier works, I am afraid there is not much added value for your money 
 I love hip hop and anything that has a beat to it and I liked 'It's goin' down' when I heard it on the radio. However, I just listened to sample tracks on amazon for this cd and came across 'Dope boy magic.' When I heard him rap about 9/11 I was immediately turned off and enraged. How could he rap about something that tragic?! Does he think it boosts his image or will sell him more records?! Hopefully not! This is disgusting! I hope anyone that wants to buy this piece of crap listens to 'Dope boy magic' (and more than likely others too, but I didn't stick around to listen) before purchasing to see for themselves what a SOB this guy is. 
 Jet Li as a contrac killer? Come on! The reason why this movie isn't that famous is because it pretty much sucks. It's just a shootem up bang bang type of movie. No realy kung fu here 
 Don't waste your time or money.  What she wrote in the First Theme Gardens is enough.  If you can't find the first one then this is a good book, but as a REVISED and UPDATED Edition the changes were very subtle 
 This book reminds me of the ramblings of a conspiracy theorist.  Mr Thomas has a terrible tendancy of starting stories showing operatives in the present (which is totally uninteresting) then flashing back to the past.  Often the flashbacks never revert to the present, or have another flashback within a flashback.    I am no expert on Israeli intelligence activities, but when an author falsly reports a simple fact "Israel has developed its own over-the-horizon accuracy for three German-build nuclear-powered submarines it had bought" (Germany doesn't have nuclear powered submarines, and Israel certainly doesn't have them) I begin to question his more controvertial theories and "facts. 
 We got this for our kids who are big Pirates fans. This toy should never have been released, it's a piece of junk to make a quick buck from the movie.  It's a junky non-functional ripoff of the classic Viewmaster concept, and while my kids (3 & 6) can work Viewmaster, this telescope in no way works--there are several MAJOR design flaws.  The disks holding the picture don't center so the pic won't show up, the disk pops out when you try to turn to the next picture and won't stay in if you so much as move the telescope, you can't even see the picture unless the telescope is totally collapsed (which is tough, since the wobbly piece of junk won't stay shut).  And IF your kid can get all this stuff right, you are rewarded with... A BLURRY barely visible image. I've bought a lot of toys and don't always expect perfection, but this is seriously the junkiest hunk of *$#* I have ever purchased.  Whoever churned this out in time for the P.o.t.C. marketing blitz has surely never met any kids or any quality control personnel.  I wish I could give less than one star.  Thank God the designer of this is only making children's toys and not airplanes or cars 
 "The Hidden Queen" is a fantasy adventure set in a mythical pre-gunpowder kingdom -- sword & sorcery. The king & his lead general die in battle and the kingdom is in danger of being overrun. The second in charge general is new, unpopular, and decides that desparate measures are needed. He asks the king's illegitimate son, S--, age 20, to lead the army to victory. S-- does so and proceeds to take the kingdom from the rightful heir, the king's 8 year old daughter A--.  She goes into hiding, and S-- looks for her, to solidify his rule.   My main problem with this book is that it just couldn't keep hold of my attention. All of the elements were there, I liked the setting, I liked the plot, but it simply failed to capture my interest. I'm not entirely sure why.  Here is what I can identify:  too much of the book is written in passive voice, A-- is bland and borring, and the text meandered way too often between different points of view.  This would have been a much stronger book if S-- were more likable. The events that were thrown in to make S-- appear a villain seemed incongruous to me, and the entire series would have had a very poignant twist, like a classical tragedy, if S-- acted reasonably honorably and was for the most part a good leader -- that is, if the main point of conflict were that both A-- and S-- wanted to rule.   Anyway, many people really enjoyed "The Hidden Queen" and maybe you will too. 
 It did not help me with breeding.  It said that you should spay you rabbit, that is incorect info.  You should never spay a rabbit or do any other sugery on them, because their skin is to fin and silky to hold  stiches and then it rips 
 First of all the diapers get stuck in the lid, and then the room starts to smell like baby poop. Yes you can use reg bags for it, the only + about it. First day after changing the bag it smells OK but buy the 2nd WOW it stinks so badly and when you open it to change the bag the smell is unbearable. 
 De Soto's work was viewed by economists, historians, and politicians alike as breakthrough.  He gives us an in-depth look at the Lima's informal sector and postulates, much to the satisfaction of his Washington, D.C.  bankroll, that Peruvians are bursting to embrace democracy and market  capitalism.  Unfortunately, he has twisted Peru's real scenario to reflect  what Washington wants to hear.  In reality, Lima's informal sector is  merely a way for a depraved population to survive, not a radical shift  toward capitalism.  De Soto's Institue for Liberty and Democracy was funded  almost in full by Washington, and the man himself has spent more time in  the U.S. than in Peru.  This book leans more toward American propaganda  than objective analysis.  An interesting read, but only with abundant  grains of salt 
 I learn from my experience if only a handful of people rated 5 stars don't believe it.  I only read 15% of this book, and it is really really borring. I didn't laugh one bit.  This book say if I am not laughing than I don't have humor.  That's a lame excuse for a boring book.  If this is really 5 stars, I can write a 10 stars book for people to laugh at intelligent and witty jokes, not stupid unlaughable joke like this book.  But, Amazon is way cool, 5 stars bookstore.  I have bought quite a few books (> 50) at Amazon, and I will continue to buy it.  Recommend: I did laugh with for better or for worst by Lynn Johnston.  Clean and witty whole some family jokes.  Judy Carter is also very funny.  These two ladies are way cool  
 This is a preety good game but after a while, it is very boring. i enjoyed it for about 2 months but now i am not intrested in it 
 After having read Baldacci's "Camel Club" this one came as an utter disapointment.... the book starts off describing the assasination of a US senator and how the lead secret service agent in charge of his protection ended up out of the service and discredited for having lost his charge.... sounds like an interseting way to start the book; the main problem is Baldacci never takes the time to introduce any of the characters.... after a while i couldnt keep reading the book because i felt i didnt care for the characters enough... i didnt really care to know what happened next to them since i didnt really "know" any of them... it was like reading a newspaper article.... a way too long newspaper article.. 
 Someone's trying to kill Soap star Mary Lisa Beverly, and how I wish they'd succeeded. This book doesn't do either the mystery or romanance genres justice, and thread throughout is a lame shooting report from the set of the soap whose title forms the title of the book. Does anybody care that Mary Lisa's character in the soap meets her long-believed dead father? What does this have to do with the death plot? And what's a small town cop from Oregon doing stepping into an investigation in California? The book explains Mary Lisa's father and a rejected lover both asked him to, but Jack Wolf's got his own murder to sleuth, so what's he doing in Oregon, other than making eyes at our heroine. Much of the book centers on flirting between the Oregon sheriff and Mary Lisa, stuff that has little to do with the plot and indeed detracts from it, and the book is in serious need of an editor. At one place, Mary Lisa refers to the "Sheik of Aran." Argh!  This is one to skip. Generally a good writer, Catherine Coulter must have pulled this one out of the rejected pile. It should be thrown back 
 The topic is very interesting but the writing is fuzzy, difficult to follow. I felt as if I was wading through a lot of jetsam to pick up here and there extremely interesting facts. I would trudge through a page or two and enjoy one paragraph 
 I read this work when it originally appeared in the Hebrew press. Grossman is a skillful writer and propagandist and the work is very artfully done. Nonetheless the work is a one- sided piece in which he makes the Palestinians far more moderate and humane in relation to the Israelis than their own media or their own terrorist actions have ever evidenced. One particular moment of the sentimentalization particularly offended me, when Grossman sees in the face of an old Palestinian the face of a grandparent of his from the Shoah. Perhaps he should have seen in the face of the descendants of survivors of the Shoah murdered by the Palestinians( Of which there are not a few in Israel) the face of his own grandparent.That might too have been sentimental but at least it would have reflected a true historical reality.  
 I was 7 year old in 1997-1998, but I hate in the disney style of the Crocodile from Peter pan, what my faovirte character in disney Peter pan is James hook, I also like his voice and his Dress, becuase he look like a 1701-1807s Colony, but I hate the Crocodile who kill Captain Hook, in the Disney Style, and Ruin his Dress, and kill him, I hate that Crocodile, Lot!!! 
 I loved this blender while it was working.  I mostly used it to make smoothies with frozen fruit.  I love that it has seamless buttons so food can't get caught in little cracks.  I rarely used the food processor.  After about 11 months, mine also started to smell like it was catching fire - however, it was the black piece in the bottom of the blending jar, which was basically being "Shaved" by the base motor.  I had to order a replacement "blender cutting assembly" from the Cuisinart website for $15 with shipping, only to have it happen again.  Plus, it was a pain to clean - the base threading didn't match up well with the jar and screwing and unscrewing the base was often difficult.  We've replaced the blender with another brand but I have kept the bottom motor part for the processor 
 I find it difficult to believe that any serious writer would feel comfortable using this overly simplistic approach to character development.  A character created from a mish-mash of bullet point-ed traits would be very flat...existing merely as a stereotype.  And I can't decide whether to be overjoyed or dismayed that librarians are not included (omitted perhaps to leave room for the 'careers' of "kept woman", "corporate wife", or "shadow mom").  Perhaps some "types" of people are already so stereotyped that Dr. Edelstein felt no need for inclusion.  Oh yes, and did I mention that use of eyedrops and incense is a sure sign that the character is a marijuana user?  Please 
 The movie Like It Is, directed by Paul Oremland, has to deal with a boxer/fighter Craig (Steve Bell) as a guy who is trying to crawl out from the fighting life he is in. Craig meets Matt (Ian Rose) who is a band manager/record producer who takes a romantic interest in Craig and the two head off to London. It is in London that trouble begins to unravel the relationshi as Matt's boss tries to split the two up. The movie wraps up with Matt trying to get Craig back before their relationship is doomed. Both Steve Bell and Ian Rose do a decent job of acting in spite of the terrible script that is so disjointed by terrible editting and poor scene transition. There really is nothing new in this film: drugs run rampart, pretty boys litter the set, and sleazy gritty characters are plentiful. In addition, the fight scenes make you wince with how fake it come across. The lack of character development doesn't fully connect the viewer and the drama happening to the characters in the story, thus by the time half the movie is done you really don't care if Craig and Matt get together or not. The only glimmer of promise in this movie was the techno soundtrack which was fairly funky and enjoyable. Finally, when the movie comes to an abrupt end, Like It Is seems more like a recipe on what a movie shouldn't be 
 I am extremely disapointed that the recipes in this book are not vegetarian.I recommend this book to no one.   Buy Mollie Katzen's excellent cookbooks The Moosewood Cookbook, Still Life With Menu, and Vegetable Heaven instead 
 I do not solder so this book was not very helpful. If you can solder this book is excellent. I do wirework but with soldering required for most of the chains I have to return the book 
 I know Gary Moore Is not the greatest on this dvd. I bought it was  not very happy.Then I seen another dvd by Gary Moore called Ballads & Blues 1982 -1994.Also on the dvd was live Blues with BB King.  Since I love blues Gary Moore & BB King.It was a Import only a few sellers were selling it.I bought one when It came I put it in my dvd player.This dvd of Gary Moore with BB King blew me away.I went back on amazon to see if there were any more left.They were all gone for about 2 or 3 months.Was told the dvd Is rare & hard to find.After keeping my eyes open for a while.It was for sale on amazon again bought 2 more.I did not know if the dvd would be available again.Its a piece of history to own for Gary Moore & BB King fans 
 I guess this book would be better appreciated by those who actually believe in magic, protection spells and things like that. The book does offer it's fair share of information to those who are just interested in monsters generally, but there are far more better books for that kind of research.  The book has chapters for ghosts, demons, angels, werewolves, vampires and other things that go bump in the night. Greer has included sightings and legends from the history, but I always found myself wanting more details. Most portions of the book are about monsters generally and they also offer magical means to defend oneself from monsters. If you are not interested in magic and spells, the book offers only a brief glance into the monster lore.  I was somewhat disappointed in the book, it had only a few interesting bits and pieces of information. Most of the times I found myself reading about Greer's own theories, which I am sorry to say, didn't seem too convincing. If you are offering an example from the history or news, you should include more information about it, otherwise the example has no real use.  If you are interested magic and it's involvement with monsters, this might be the book for you. If you want to really read about monsters, I recommend you find other books for your reading pleasure 
 I picked this book up because I was running out of decent mystery novels, and figured I was primed to love it given my obsession with the outdoors as well as mysteries.   It only gets two stars because I actually made it through. And I only got through it because I had nothing else to read.    I know Nevada Barr is a "name," and judging by the number of her books stocked in my local bookstore, a popular one. But I could list the things that are wrong with her writing for...well, let's just say more space than Amazon is going to give me for this review. Her prose is bad. Her imagery is unlively (and if you're going to write about a landscape like Anna Pigeon's, you sure as hell ought to be able to write it). Her characters range from the merely flat to the utterly ridiculous (Anna's romantic progression through this book: "Oh, I am widowed and my life will never be the same without my husband" to "Oh, it might be fun to be a lesbian" [an out-of-the-blue idea the author never bothers to resolve] to "Let me have a fling with this random man, who, by the way, has as much character as a cardboard cut-out").   Worst of all, she cheats. I guess mystery writers don't have an official code, but according to the Dorothy L Sayers model, Thou Shalt Not Give the Detective Clues Not Given To The Reader. A mystery novel is no fun if the puzzle isn't there for you too. Of course, if Nevada Barr had given us all the evidence she gives Anna Pigeon, there wouldn't be a mystery to have a novel about. Her cheating merely covers up her inability to produce an engaging and puzzling plot.   This was a pathetically sub-par book for the amount of attention it and its sequels have received. If you're looking for an amazing female detective, check out Laurie R King's two series, one about Sherlock Holmes' feminist partner Mary Russell (as unlikely as it sounds, and more than good enough to make up for it), and the other about San Francisco cop Kate Martinelli. If you want a book about living in the desert, I'd suggest Edward Abbey's _Desert Solitaire_ (it even has a brief appearance by a dead body), or his hilarious eco-terrorist adventure _The Monkey Wrench Gang_.   Anything but this 
 While the book itself is great, and shows how to build an "industrial (almost)strength" type machine, the required complexity and construction, are beyond the ability of many hobbyists (as well as being relatively expensive). In particular, it requires welding and fabrication skills not generally available to the home hobbyist. Having said that, there is much to be learned, and using some of instructions and resources in the book, many people could easily build (as I intend) to build a somewhat simpler version, than is shown in this book 
 I bought this version of the popular fairy tale as a gift for my niece. After I received it, I was horrified to read in detail about how the huntsman cut open the wolf's stomach to look for the grandmother. It then goes on to read, ". . . after a few more slashes a little girl jumped out.." This was not at all what I had envisioned as a gift for a young girl. I wish I had been warned to buy the story from a different author 
 This is a revolutionary book. It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage. It's questionable how novel this metaphor is, but this is certianly its first explicit statement. The language used to present the ideas of the author is, like most sociological writing, unecessarily complicated. There are some problems with clarity and structure; the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me. No sociological background is presupposed, there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources, many footnotes, and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book. So if you are interested in reading sociology, this is probably a good place to start (again, the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it's bane as an introduction).  However, the book is misguided. The idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary. The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer.  (The following is a charicature of the author's argument). There is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people (the audience) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor. Well, if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations, infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage, "All the world is not, of course, a stage, but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify" (p 72). The performances can either be with individuals, or groups of people, and they can be performing conciously or unconciously. (end of charicature)  There are other arguments, obviously, and the statement "we can draw a parallel with other situations" is most of the content of the book, which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence. But the real question here is, is the view worthwhile? My answer: No. Social interaction is a complex phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor. Yes, some social interaction is like a performance, where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another. Yes, some social behavior can arise from unconcious beliefs. However, most social interaction is exactly the way we see it, conciously controlled, meaningful, purposeful interaction with individuals; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a "reality".  I hope my view of the book is clear so that the biases on the final part of my review can be sorted out: the book is a waste of time. Where the author is right, the statement is little more than common sense. Where the author goes outside of common sense, he's wrong, sometimes plainly so. This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes, that reality is a social construct with no purpose other than social control (here the wool is the performance, and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an obscure mess of assertions). There is no real empirical support given for most of the claims. Where "evidence" is given, the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter. Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth. Various sources of sociology are cited, but this is more like intellectual bullying. Saying that some author, which also didnt have any empirical support for his claims, agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims. The claims in the book have no practical application in the world, but only serve to intepret situations differently, and in personal opinion, less correctly. Nothing said here will lead to better predictions about social behavior or a better understanding of psychology. In short, this isnt a scientific study at all.   My final qualm with the book deserves its own paragraph, the use of language. The best example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction "A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants" (15). This is a curios definition. Me breathing while i work is a performance, it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers. Me staring into space is a performance, other people see me stare into space and are therefore influenced. Infact, me simply existing is a performance, since my existance causes a gravitational effect on the other participants, as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing. Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all possible actions taken by any person, and then wrote a book about how all possible actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance. He didnt. He used a word that we associate with controlled behavior (performance) and defined it in a way no one is used to. Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance, its all for the purpose of maintaining social reality. I hope this very limited example shows the terrible use of language that is endemic to Goffman and sociology more generally.  So an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt. Why wont this subject go away? This book is an integral part of sociology, and it espouses the methods and style of sociological researchers and writers by being an archetypical work within the tradition. The methods are questionable; the style is obscure. Like it or hate it, sociology is a part of modern thought. Read the book to be an educated person and keep in mind its intellectual failings 
 Amazon.com does not tell you on the description page that you cannot receive a refund for this terrible product.  The interface (Adobe eBook Reader) is acceptable for a volume that will be read page-by-page.  It is TOTALLY wrong for this 1,000+ page reference book.  It is a nightmare to find anything in this product.  Buy the hardcover or paper back but don't throw away $30 on this version.  Tecnically speaking it, it's a bow-wow 
 Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.    This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror 
 The author thinks, acts and writes like it is 1970.  I would think that the five star reviews were from her friends and family but no one in the book liked her.  Do not waste your time or money on this  self centered idiot.  
 I am going to quote Aihwa Ong - Antrhopology Professor from UC Berkeley who criticized "Modernity at Large" since I cannot state it any better than her:  "When an approach to cultural globalization seeks merely to sketch out universalizing trends rather than deal with actually existing structures of power and situated cultural processes, the analysis cries out for a sense of political economy and situated ethnography."  Appadurai is essentially Thomas Friedman in a graduated sense for academia 
 Ever wonder for which bipolar monomaniac the Sorcerer's Apprentice worked? Now you know. Drier than Dryden, boot-licking admirer of the thief of his childhood, humorless bookworm of a dusty aristocrat, protonerd ex machina in extremis. When Continent-lazing navel-gazers concern themselves with improving society, oil your firearms. I'd rather a deep belly laugh than Mill's musings, any day 
 I have to strongly disagree with the editorial and reader reviews on this essay, even though it was a national bestseller. The book is touted as possibly the most rational description of a descent into morbid, clinical depression and suicidal despair. I didn't find it so. Styron was descriptive but rather than probing and baring the depths of his mind and emotions during his depression, I felt he only hinted at the tip of the iceberg. I didn't find any riveting, palpable tracing of his depression. It was rather moribund for a subject with such potential. There is a detachment throughout that many attribute to Styron's calculating dismantling of his own emotions to throw light into the abyss. I found the detachment sort of hovering over the pond, unwilling to dive in, which robs the reader. Candor, yes in some aspects. Precision, somewhat missing.  He quotes Dante "In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself in a dark wood, for I had lost the right path." Styron was in the melancholia described by Dante but he never succeeds at identifying why or even how he managed to eventually recover.  From what most reviewers have said, this book should have been the definitive treatise on deep depression, written by a survivor. It is not that impressive at all 
 Yes, we all thought it would be good but it is best to chalk this one off as a loss. If you were unfortunate enough to be someone who actually paid for the album, the going rate on ebay is around  
 i bought this album after hearing about them from a fellow beach boys fan.  i'm a huge pet sounds fan, but i love all kinds of orchestrated rock from "the left banke" to "beulah."  this album is not that good, people.  it's not even "okay."  there are way better takes on the "brian wilson" (read: phil spector) sound.  whether it's "the ladybug transistor" or "the apples in stereo."  heck, check out a great vancouver band called "ashley park" as well. the production on this is so rooted in the eighties/nineties that it's almost unlistenable.  they may be good road musicians but it doesn't show on this album, especially since some of tracks use lamo drum loops "a la stone roses."  you would be better off going through the elephant 6 label's recordings or even merge stuff.  to be honest, i didn't even find the compositions that scintillating, regardless of the production.  chord and change-wise, they're interesting....but that doesn't make the songs good. 
 Text aside, Susan Jeffer's book on Chief Seattle has inaccurate illustrations of historic Northwest Coast tribal costume, dwellings and landscape.  I also use this book with my third graders every year - but only to show the kids how some authors have not done adequate research before publishing.   There are other great children's books on the subject from lesser known authors and smaller publishers.  It may be worth your while to look them up 
 This is absolutely sick- it's been recommended that children under one year of age not be subjected to ANY video at all, but this is intended to force creationism on babies barely old enough to think at all???  I shudder to think of what outcome this will have in a few years 
 It is unfortunate that there is no good history of the Hmong published in any Western language.  Keith Quincy must be commended on his effort, but it is disappointing.  He is not a professional historian.  The first chapter  in particular, ostensibly dealing with the Hmong experience in China, shows  his unfamiliarity with Chinese history and inability to use Chinese  sources.  (The story of the "Hmong" king's defeat by China  actually concerns the conquest of the Jinchuan people, who were not Hmong.)   Quincy uncritically uses an unreliable account by F. Savina, _Histoire des  Miao_ (Hong Kong, 1924).  For a better study of Hmong in China see Robert  Jenks, _Insurgency and Social Disorder in Guizhou_ (University of Hawaii  Press, 1994).  The rest of the book is a little better, but must be read  with caution and cross-checked with other sources 
 This is typical political hip hop. Rants, slander, and completely moronic and asinine conspiracy theories. All accompanied by weak beats, bad lyrics, and terrible performances by M(oron)-1. This political rap garbage needs to die out and it makes me happy to know this junk flopped. Save your money and buy Ghostface's new album. This will be surely headed to my list of the year's worst albums. Big Big Big Big Thumbs down 
 Anyone basing their understanding of this Austen novel on this movie alone will be misled.  Perhaps the director or producer wanted to make the film "relevant" to today's "hip" audiences (which don't understand anything sophisticated).  While the film was helpful to me in establishing the characters prior to my reading the book itself, I found that the novel has none of the raciness or even some of the scenes that are found in this film.  As is often the case, viewers will find that "the book is much better than the movie."  The acting is fine, but what the actors are asked to act is not faithful to how the real story unfolds.  
 This is the off-beat story of Esker, a 31 year old woman who, since her college years, has been haunted by a past relationship disappointment.  The question of the story: will she allow a man to love her again?  Interesting premise, but there are many problems with the way it was handled: the previous lover was so unloving it's difficult to empathize with the extreme loss Esker's felt in his absence;  Esker offers so little in the way of emotional connection to the new man in her life, his continued affection for her doesn't make sense; the book never delivers anything in the way of character growth or change.  Nothing happens here.  She's unhappy in the beginning.  She stays that way.  A real disappointment.  I got the sense the author was more interested in the way she used language than in what she was actually saying 
 I got these to replace my yellow Sony sports headphones.  The yellow ones were kind of "rubbery" and I've had them for years.  These broke within 3 weeks.  And not under great stress or high use, either.  Just simply taking them off of my head by pulling them apart to get them out of my ear and they broke where the length of the left ear adjusts.    Very poor design and cheap plastic.  I'll buy other Sony headphones, especially if I can find ones made similar to my older yellow ones.  But I will never buy another set of these.  Plus: They sound great  Con: They are such poor design that they broke at a really thin place of construction that would get a LOT of pressure from anyone when putting them on or taking them off their head.  
 We recently purchased this book in anticipation of a trip to the Outer Banks (as I am sure anyone looking at this is considering doing). The book was a useful tool but we did encounter some problems.  First, I'll mention what they got right: the book is very comprehensive and all the various categories (lodging, attractions, et cetera) are grouped by the town they are in. This was useful as we would spend a day or two in a town and then move on to another. We found the accomodations section especially helpful as we did not make reservations in advance. The hotels we stayed at were all acceptable (and as described in the book) and the price ranges in the book reflected the real world cost.  But this guide is not without its faults. While we did not run into any trouble with our lodging, the blurbs in the guide about each hotel do not appear to be written by people who stayed at the hotel but read more like the literature a hotel would give out. I am not sure how the hotel reviews were gathered but they really read more like advertisements than reviews.  Finally, where the guide really steered us wrong (and a big reason why I think the bulk of the "reviews" are just blurbs received from the owners of the establishments) was with the Native American Museum. The guide described this as a very nice visit and one where admission would be $2 per person. Well, when we got there it was $5. Furthermore, when we made the mistake of going inside, we found anything but an enjoyable time. The building is a crowded mismash of items with no explanation for their appearance there. One closest-like enclosure contains three glass cases of various head gear. I particularly enjoyed seeing the Maryland State police baseball cap. Of course there was no explanation for why such a hat would be on display. Alas, the baseball cap was behind glass so I couldn't touch this important relic. The MD police cap is indicative of the whole experience. After winding through all these clutter, we came to a television set in the basement with nothing but static. It truly felt like the beginning of a bad horror movie. Avoid this scam at all costs.  Given that the reviews of attractions are, at best, not very critical, and, at worst, advertisements sent in by the owners, I would suggest picking up a different guide, getting literature from the visitor's center in Kitty Hawk (very helpful folks there) or asking around when you get there. We found the Cape Hatteras lighthouse (and the climb to the top) especially enjoyable. We also found the Duke of Dare motel in Manteo to be an inexpensive alternative to some of the larger hotels. Also, the Oregon Inlet has a great public swimming area that was never crowded. Enjoy your trip 
 Ms Dawn has written an account of her Sabbath keeping, not God's.  Neither the day, nor her practices, are of the Lord's making.  Sunday cannot be called the Sabbath because it is not the 7th day but the 1st day of the week - a day chosen by man, not God.  Since man cannot make anything holy, it is just a day to cease working.  Ms Dawn should read the book "The Sabbath" by Abraham Joshua Heschel in order to know what "keeping the Sabbath Wholly -and Holy - means.  I was very disappointed because there is no worship, no praise - merely personal indulgences.  Just like Cain's offering, Sunday keeping is a substitution offering by man and presented to God in place of what He requires.  This is never acceptable to God. I am concerned about the author's lack of knowledge of the Scripture. We are advised to "obey God rather than man" 
 I bought the "original" "The Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook". I loved its humor and so I gave this one a try. I cant say it's bad. However, it's somehow much more serious than the original one, thus less humorous and fun. The problem is: it's not indepth nor detailed enough to cover, in my opinion as a white collar for over 15 years, 1/5 of the common difficulties in an office.   In short, if you really wanna improve your survival opportunities in your job, there are many better alternatives in a bookstore. If you just wanna have fun, this is definitely not a good choice. Therefore, not recommended. If you really wanna buy it, I sincerely suggest you to read the "See sample pages" here on Amazon for a quick look of what those "tips" refer to 
 An interesting but implausible tale to say the least. The author writes about the existence of stone "platforms" on Cape Breton Island (CBI) that he stumbled across a few years back. Curious, he tries to track down the builders of said platforms with the usual suspects being the French and the English. Going through the existing historical record reveals nothing about who the builders could be.  He then makes the jump to the idea that it must have been Chinese explorers/settlers who did the work during the heyday of Ming China's voyages of discovery. (I suspect that those voyages were more about tribute gathering and trade than about discovery.) Anyone familiar with Menzies' book 1421 will know his theory of how the Chinese sent expeditions circling around the globe yet mysteriously somehow missing Europe(!).  I'm extremely skeptical about Chiasson's theory that it was the Chinese who built the platforms for a couple of reasons. First of all, there is very little reason that I could see as to why anyone would want to build a settlement on Cape Breton Island unless there was something very valuable there. As Chiasson says, there is coal and there is gold. Unfortunately for the theory, China has lots of coal so it would not be economically viable to transport it all the way back to China from CBI and the gold deposits were not enough to sustain later European ventures. Again, China has closer sources of gold at hand and, even if they were to send out fleets of gold miners, there are closer sources along the way to CBI such as South Africa, West Africa, and Central America.  Second, Chiasson's talk of the Chinese using the Gulf Stream to mosey on up the Eastern Seaboard sounds plausible but he also fails to mention that this same current will eventually land you in Ireland and Scotland too!  There are also a couple of other bothersome points I'd like to bring up. First, Breton does not refer to the English but to the region of Brittany in France. And, second, the pictures of the Minority Peoples of China that he uses to posit a possible link between China and the local Micmac (sp) tribe is laughable. It's implausible to suppose that such people would be on board important Han Chinese voyages in sufficient numbers to make a cultural difference in a tribe thousands of miles away!  Like I said, interesting but implausible. I suspect that only actual archaeological digs will dispel the mystery of the platforms, if any 
 Seriously you dont need me to tell you wack this album is, if you've ever heard it you'll know yourself the depths that this album plummets to.  I'll be honest, I heard Thug Lovin on the radio and thought it was O.K, all the other singles though, Mesmerize etc.. were s**t.  A friend of mine offered to burn me a copy, free of charge, and i thought fine, what's the worst that could happen, I was mistaken, I would compare listening to this with torture.  If your into sing along pop songs, with a little bad language for good measure, you may like this album.  To put this in the hip-hop genre is misleading, Ja actually attempts to 'sing' half the songs on here, and when he's not singing he does his best Tupac impression.  Thankfully at the time of writing this, his career appears to be over, if we can rid the hip-hop world of Nelly and 50 Cent as well, the world would be much better  for it.  Avoid any albums by this phoney.  Message to the honorable, agreed most of the rappers listed are s**t, but Ja destroying Snoop, Eazy-E, Mack 10 and DMX, don't talk s**t, this diva couldn't touch any of them.  After writing this I noticed someone was selling this album on Amazon for 1 cent, that should tell you all you need to know about it 
 I was initially delighted to stumble upon this new series.  I love the premise of an older protagonist and the Cotswold setting; I even loved the cover.  Imagine my shock when I got to page 158 and read the following dialogue as spoken by one of the characters:  ".... the circumstances perfectly obeyed the rites of Wicca.  He had been impaled by a pitchfork through the throat, pinned to the ground so his blood would flow into the soil, to nourish it -"  I don't know what sources Ms. Harwin utilized in her writing of this novel, but as a practitioner of Wicca myself for 15 years, I can attest to the fact that nowhere in our religion does impaling - or ANY kind of bloodletting - "obey the rites of Wicca".  In fact it is quite the opposite, as the first and foremost rule of Wicca is `Harm None'.  Wicca is a defined, well-documented religion with very specific principles and practices, with strict rules against harming anyone, EVER.      Before I reached that page I'd actually been in Barnes and Noble earlier that day looking for a copy of the next in the series.  They didn't have it, and now I'm glad they didn't.    Harwin's careless, uneducated passing comments in this book are not only offensive but extremely irresponsible. I don't know when I've been more disappointed in a writer.  I'm sorry that this promising series has now been ruined for me. 
 For a class that I'm taking, we were asked to read one book from the American Library Association's 2007 Best Books for Young Adults list. Clay was the first one, seeing as how they're in alphabetical order by author's last name.  I have struggled through 86 pages and I'm giving up. Where is the book located? Somewhere where they speak English, but not the American way. When is the book set? At one point, I thought it was the 60s, but I'm not sure. What is the book about? Nothing interesting.  Perhaps the book is just too deep for me. But here's my question: I'm 23 years old, with a college degree and plenty of practical life experience. If it's too deep for me, what 16-year-old is going to read it 
 Upon hearing about the controversy surrounding steriods and baseball, I was remotely curious about Canseco's "tell-all" book on the subject. However The self proclamied "Godfather of Roids" book talked more about shifting the media bias than steroids. The entire book Canseco whinned about how Good Ole' American boys like Mark McGwire and Cal Ripken were beloved heros, and Latin players like himself were cast away. Jose allegedly named names... All this guy did was RAT on fellow teamates. He is below scum, and he wants to portray himself a Mystical figure who took ILLEGAL drugs to keep a wish to his dying mother.  The book was difficult to read and only sold books because of it's shock value. Now I can see why i hated Jose so much as a kid growing up an avid bay area baseball fan. I wouldn't recoomend this book to ANYBODY! If I could I would give it negative 5 star 
 After reading this book and reading most of the posts, I can say that the ones who disagree with S. Hannity stole my thoughts. S. Hannity is good at yelling at guests on his tv show but nothing else. He never offers a thoughtful opinion and he argues with the stomach and never uses his brain. If you like controversy then buy Bill O'reilly and Michelle Malkin's books at least those two try their best to get their points across. Hannity's book is a waste of many even though it's only 5 dollars (you can buy two Mcdonald chicken sandwiches for that price).  
 I have re-read my 1984 edition of 'Men in Groups' and find it strange that this book has been published again in 2004 considering its errors and antiquated tone. I cannot imagine how the new introduction to the 2004 edition can get round these problems - for the author to take into consideration the knew knowledge about primates and human evolution and the actual changes in women's 'nature' in recent decades automatically renders the book obsolete.  Certainly, male bonding is a fact of human societies that needed to be recognized but we are now well past the false glorification of 'man-the-hunter' which pervades this book.  Tiger says his intention was that of abetting the feminist position by illustrating the depth and pervasiveness of the male conspiracy against women so it is somewhat amusing to find in his more recent wrtings that he is not as thrilled by the changes women have accomplished as we would expect.  The author could be forgiven in 1969 for ignorance regarding primates and human evolution. This ignorance led to his attempts to find the roots of human male bonding in hunting as he supposed that our ancestors were matrilocal, as most mammals are. Now we know our direct connection to chimpanzees we can see that they are patrilocal male kin groups with the females transfering to breed. Females are the outsiders - entering one group of male kin from another group of male kin that are their competitors and enemies. This is how it is, or has been, for human societies too. The odds were stacked in favor of male bonding and male self-interest and against that of females well before humans came along.  Tiger recognizes (at least he did in 1969) how male homosociality is detrimental to females and to humankind in general but he also feels compelled to sing its praises as if it has some magical quality beyond self-interest. He has the problem of wanting to find ways to feed and sustain the primitive and needy male homosociality while changing the outcome to something more civilized than we actually have. It is lke trying to cure an illness but refusing to accept the cause. There is a lot of male narcissism here along with a condesending attitude towards women that is hard to believe was so natural for men only 38 years ago.  Basically this book is obsolete. And, when all's said and done, why is it that if it is men driving human evolution, intelligence etc women always find themselves married to 'Homer Simpson'?? : 
 This lightweight booklet is terribly researched with numerous factual errors, particularly in the first four chapters.  Later, when giving buying advice, it assumes you are a low-credit, high-risk buyer.  A much better book is John Grissim's 
 Pigs in the Mud In the Middle of the Rud  Lynn plourde and John Schoenherr Down East Books  	This story is about pigs in the mud right in the middle of the rud. The family members are all  driving on the trail and they see these pigs in the mud, so they stoped and got out and tried to push them but `they are not budging.   There were chickens stuck in the mud, then came the fluffy sheep,then  then the big bulls came in the middle of the rud. 	The grandma in this book is the one in charge here. She bosses every one around in the book.  Grandma is old and uptight. There are two brothers and one sister in the family and the mom is the one who doesn't do anything in the book.  The brothers and sisters are the ones that  are mostly trying to get the animals out of the mud.  	I do not recommend this book because it didn't make any sense at all. The characters in this book are not lifelike. The main idea  of the whole book this book that the family couldn't get through the mud, but  they could just go around pigs and all he other animals in the mud, The book is not good for me but it might for good for little kids that like this kind of book 
 This book as badly organized and basically useless.  One of the worst books in the field 
 Most of the James Ellroy's cops are mean, tough, cunning, crooked, dirty low lives. So the Reader's voice that was chosen to be as the 1st person in the book, starting all the sentences with an "I", playing himself as the dirty cop, that should be sound like a cop, a tough, mean, foxy guy with a tough, cold, heartless voice. To my deepest regret with a funny feeling, the voice of Mr. Jermy Gage is a total joke. His voice is so thin, so narrow, so shallow and so scholastically wrong. His voice is not a cop's voice in the least but a voice with pipe and eye glasses, a voice coming from the mouth of 150 pounds body weight, in short, a chicken's voice. I just couldn't keep listening to that funny voice which was definitely not a believable cop's voice. After trying so hard listened to that voice for 25 minutes, I just turned the recorder off and picked up the real book and just let my own inner voice to become that "I", that dirty, mean, tough, cunning cop, and survived page after page. Don't try to make the same fault as I did, it'd ruin your free and more realistic imagination 
 I have been doing a lot of reading on Welles for a research project and while it is clear that Welles was no angel, this book seems to go out of its way to put Welles in the worst possible light.  There are too many flights of fancy and liberties taken.  For example, based on no evidence Thomson suggests that not only did Welles have sexual relations with Dorothy Commingore but that he practically raped her.  Perhaps the book reveals more about the author than it does about its subject.  There are some useful takes  on lesser known figures like John Toland but on the whole it is a book to take with several grains of salt 
 I actually sent this bag back immediatley after opening!  I knew it was going to be plastic which was fine with me.  I could use it in the summer at the beach or by the pool.  But, the description said it was trimmed in geniune "pig skin" leather.  When I recieved the bag there was no leather to be found on the bag.  The trim was some type of weird plastic aswell.  It was the cheapest and most fake looking bag I have ever seen!  I couldn't believe that Amazon was selling this product for $200!  I love Amazon and everything they have to offer!  They really shouldn't put there name behind this product anymore.  Any faithful Amazon custom would be shocked and appauled to recieve this on there front step!  I know I was!!!  
 Santa brought this item.  We opened it several days later and it broke the same day.  
 His analysis of the causes of inflation and business cycle, I feel are simplistic and naive.  It is, however a somewhat adequate introduction to the Austrian school of economics.  This book together with the Worldly Philosophers by Robert L. Heilbroner provide a good survey of economic thought, but alone this book is misleading and inadequate 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope 
 I'm having a hard time understanding who would pay money for this downgrade?  You'll wish you had the "XP Upgrade" as soon as you do it.  It's just baffling that they would charge this much for such an awful product 
 i never recieved this item . so i cant review it . id like it sent i vaguely remeber ordering it . so if i its on backorder or ill be recieving it soon let me know please .   thanks  
 This volume contains a wealth of information, but the bias is ruining it. I could give many examples, but one says it all. Barone claims that Trent Lott is a supporter of civil rights.  Say what 
 I've read this book with my third graders for the past several years.  They love it.  They enjoy having a candy corn contest of their own while reading the book 
       I hated this book!  Or maybe I was just rooting for C.J. to get his stuff together in the third book and have Joe Pickett ready to fly for another twenty years.  It's what I expected anyhow.  Didn't happen.   	    The first Joe Pickett story seemed a little tall and convoluted, but the yarn was spun tightly and with dexterity and wit.  I couldn't put it down.  You knew that C.J. Box and Joe Pickett would be around for a long while.  The second book had me looking forward to more Joe Pickett yarns in spite of exploding cows.  An audience was building.  Word was getting around that C.J. Box could keep you interested.  It was time for Pickett to settle down a bit, ease off the fantastics, and start a long career.  Then he fell off the mountain.       WINTERKILL opens with a humiliating and extremely unlikely scene of a Forest Supervisor's "nervous breakdown" that contributes nothing substantial to the story.  From there, it traverses a litany of extremes.  Our humble, heroic game warden in remote Wyoming is forced down a gauntlet of sociopathology, psychopathology, political aberrations, weather extremes, bureaucratic obstruction and cover-up, and the killing of a carefully developed sympathetic character.  Then, incredibly, staight-arrow Joe Picket becomes complicit in a felony that will never be discovered.  	    C.J. Box is a clever, compelling writer, but I don't see how Joe Pickett will ever recover from this dark detour.    
 This version (Workbook) of Modern Carpentry is a workbook.  Its questions that you must fill in the blank (answer).  It is NOT a book but more of a 'test' (I'm assuming) of the material in Modern Carpentry 
 This book is atrocious...plain and simple. There isn't a single thing in here that couldn't be gathered by glancing at the SDK documentation. Not to mention, it's wrong!! When was the last time you were able to access objects via the ipp provider and have your way with them?? according to this book...you can...interesting.. 
 After the many glowing reviews of this book, I was ready to love it.  But I just couldn't.  What really bothered me was I felt Daniel made totally unrealistic advances in a short period of time.  In real life, language acquisition in non-verbal autistic kids is a slow process.  My son was diagnosed over 5 years ago, and I still remember the pain the diagnosis brought, so I could relate to Melanie.  The disorder is not as easily improved as is shown here. 
 The only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck. I've read a number of James Patterson books and while I'm not a hard core fan, I've enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell.   As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour).   Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller.   The twists at the end - "he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...." by the end, I just didn't care.   James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end. 
 Sadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today.  Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page.  Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner "We're Here," which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of.  My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, "Honey, I see what you mean."   One can get the general gist, but it's best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.    	For example, when educated Harvey says, "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?" his pal Dan answers, "Allus can, till we begin to dress daown.  Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy.  Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows.  Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night.  Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?"  	I got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce's "Ulysses" than an unannotated version of this book.   	So why did I bother?  A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving.  The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me.  But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever!  (Let them read "Cannery Row" instead!)  
 I think  Mallory and the Dream Horse was a good idea for the BSC series, but it wasn't as detailed as other horse books. I should know that a white  ribbon in a horse show is 4th- I have 2 of them! Still, good idea. ALSO-  riding instructors should NOT let their riders pick what horse they want to  ride; that could be bad for all 3, and maybe even cause fights. The horse  and rider's bond wouldn't be as strong, either, and it takes at least a  month to get to a canter 
 "Something to Declare" is a clever title for a book about travel abroad; but, beyond its opening pages, that's not what this book is about. "Essays on France" is an equally misleading subtitle, for the book's erudite essays (beyond the opening chapter) are not on France but on a narrow selection of French writers and related movers and shakers, and one fictional character: Madame Bovary. After a fast-paced, dazzling opening sequence, hilariously describing the teen-aged Barnes' first encounters across the English Channel, we slow down to pick through some highlights in the lives of some of the top French authors, poets, filmmakers and other cultural icons, eventually easing to a crawl through exhaustive detail regarding the author's main interest, Flaubert and his world. If Madame Bovary is your cup of tea, you may enjoy steeping yourself further in Barnes. For me it was just too much 
 The literature of September 11 is never attacked.  When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  Jonathan Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  The narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  Nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the Dresden bombings.  Each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical "trauma" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  Oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are "reading"---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  Who has done the editing?  Almost certainly an older version of his grandson Oskar).  If the term, "reading" even applies.  Whenever a "pregnant" image is described, Foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  When a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  Words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  Space is not used in the manner it is in the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance.  Typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  Foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases ("heavy boots," "raison d'etre," etc.) and Sunday school platitudes: "Sometimes one simply wants to disappear" (184); "There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself" (184); "Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers" (245); "How can you say I love you to someone you love?...  It's always necessary" (314).  Whenever the author writes something that he finds "beautiful" and "true" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is "beautiful" and "true."  The entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  We also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also communicates in his essay, "Emptiness" (originally published in PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  Perhaps it is wrong to criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.  Joseph Suglia, Ph.D., the author of WATCH OUT 
 Sir Cyril Burt achieved unparalleled results in researching the effects of environment and heredity on identical twins.  Only after his death did it become clear that the alleged research had never happened, that Burt lied to further what he perceived to be a greater truth. Sadly, the possibility must be considered that Milton Erickson did likewise.  Not only do the results he claimed to have achieved involve impossible to believe coincidences and phenomena far beyond anything ever achieved by anyone else.  They also include results that even unshakable believers in hypnotism's real existence concede are unreplicable and should be impossible.  If Erickson really accomplished what he claimed in various medical journals, then he was a miracleworker beyond compare.  Somehow I doubt that. 
 Television is the only thing I have to look forward to, my life is sad and depressing and oh god I am going to cry  *** :( Get rid of television? are you insane?, how else would you get the children to shutu 
 Without a doubt, this book is for nobody to read.  I plowed my way through all 223 pages, and I cannot describe how restless I became with Catherine Bell's nonsense.  There are so many references that Bell is no longer backing her arguments, but is instead indicating that she has no ability for original thought.  I know that Bell is educated, but this book is proof that she is unable to communicate her ideas clearly and simply.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! 
 This is an okay read - nothing more, nothing less. The overall plot is very interesting and the story is well told up to a point. The real flaw though is the rushed, and in my opinion, corny, ending to this book. It really was substandard, straight-to-video, B-movie type of stuff (and yes, I am reviewing the book). I won't give too much away, but why at the very end would the chief baddie be the one to carry out 'the deed', and not one of his followers? And why was it the 'good' guy who tracked him down and stopped him carrying out 'the deed' - surely the police / FBI would have got him?   As with John Case's previous book, The Genesis Code, the initial plot will have you hooked, but as the story drags on it does become a little silly and rushed.   
 I first heard Julieta on a compilation CD called "Exoticas: World Music Divas." I loved "Como Sé?" so much that I purchased "Aquí." At the time, I wrote (on amazon's page for that CD) that she was, hands down, the best female rock/pop singer in the world, regardless of language. I was excited to get her second release "Bueninvento." CMJ New Music Monthly even had an article about her. Her best question was at the end, in which she asked not to be compared to Britney Spears.   I was very excited about her next release when I heard "Lo Que Venga Después," from the film "Maria Llena Eres de Gracia." Brilliant.   Now we come to this one. Dear, oh dear. What the hell happened? If there were ever a Latina equivalent to the Liz Phair blantant sell out model, we have it right here. It pains me to say this because the woman is very talented. Now she's on stage performing with some guy, and, yes, Paulina Rubio, in a video I have seen on VHUno. If you want to blow all of your credibility for an increase in sales, releasing a cheese CD and appearing with pop stars is the way to do it.    What's next for her? How about teen pop magazine covershoots with a smily face and a bunny, maybe some surgery and having a hip hop star make a guest appearance on the next CD? Gotta have lots of meetings with the hair stylist, the personal trainer, and the wardrobe consultant, because that what "artists" who focus only on image do. No time for music, ya know. The Britney Spears comparisons of insipid, vapid, bubble gum pop may begin.  I can only hope she'll return to her senses. If not, maybe Molotov can write a not-so-flattering song about her.. 
 This book carries a lot of assumptions on the authors beliefs.  It does not give practical advice on how to read auras 
 Toy broke within two days of play.  Not very good qualit 
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 This book has dull pictures that are incapable of exciting any normal grade school age kid.  The slow, relentlessly boring story doesn't do much to add to the somber picture book 
 Oh my, this book should be titled "The gas we pass", with my apologies to the writers of the book "The gas we pass."  I only wish I could have selected zero stars for rating this book--what a bunch of garbage.  I did a bit of research on the author, she is no doubt under the influence of her husband.  Apparently the Wilson's run a "Branch Davidian" like church in Moscow, Idaho.  My husband loves the various "submission" elements in this book, as other reviewers noted this is one for the boys.  It is a funny book, in a weird, freaky, mind control type of way.  I can only imagine the sex life of this poor deluded woman.....  Bottomline:  DO NOT BUY THIS BOO 
 In essence, this is a Texas Chainsaw remake, but here's the difference, and why it's far inferior. I don't care one iota for the "victims." I can barely tell the females apart. The guys are so obnoxious, I look forward to them dying. Unlike Texas Chainsaw (parts one and two, horror masterpieces!), this movie shows the "psycho family" (hmmm... kind of like Texas Chainsaw?) far too much. A little goes a long way, too much? OVERKILL! Many plot holes, and take away the music, there was some really bad acting. It gets two stars for the cool middle inserts in funky film style, and also the one great sequence where the cops are killed. But in general, Rob Zombie should not get writing credit for this. It's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, only nowhere near as good 
 As a member of a Southern family who treasured this magazine, it is with a heavy heart and a sense of loss that I have decided not to renew my subscription this year.  Yes, I've always given the brides in our family a subscription as a gift, and waited eagerly for my issue to come in the mail.  But those days are past.  Southern Living Magazine has been offered to all states for some time now, and I believe this has caused the editors to try to appeal to a broader readership.  This, in turn, has changed the recipe section into something one can find in any other magazine.  Honestly, I do love all sorts of different cuisines, but in a magazine called "Southern Living", I expect to find wonderful and traditional Southern recipes!  This magazine needs to go back to it's roots.  From now on, I'll be giving new brides a subscription to Southern Lady Magazine, and that's what I'll be reading myself!  I will miss the Christmas book, though.  
 Lucy and Ann are the best of friends.  They even share a twin bed together.  Ann gazes at Lucy during long, leisurely, naked baths.  Ann does Lucy's bidding, whatever the personal or financial cost.  I was shocked by Lucy's demands--and more shocked by Ann's willingness to comply, like a leashed dog.  I kept expecting Ann to go down on Lucy, what with all the kissing, sleeping together, and long, hard stares.  This book reminded me of the art house film 9 and half weeks, except for the fact that in this case the portagonists are both females 
 Sadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today.  Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page.  Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner "We're Here," which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of.  My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, "Honey, I see what you mean."   One can get the general gist, but it's best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.    	For example, when educated Harvey says, "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?" his pal Dan answers, "Allus can, till we begin to dress daown.  Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy.  Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows.  Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night.  Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?"  	I got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce's "Ulysses" than an unannotated version of this book.   	So why did I bother?  A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving.  The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me.  But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever!  (Let them read "Cannery Row" instead!)  
 I have never been a Demi Moore fan, but this movie is even worse than I imagined it would be. My kids picked it up in the videotheque. I decided to give it a fair chance and watched it together with them. Demi's acting is rather passionless, poor and disconnected. She looks old too ! She doesn't succeed at all in portraying a woman who is ravaged by the loss of her only child and by her own stupid fault and selfishness too. After just eight months after the tragedy she wanders off to some remote spot in Scotland to write a new novel. Yeah, sure. That's what I would do after losing my only child. I probably would be in utter shock for another 200 years or so. After five minutes you don't care at all what happens to her and what fate befalls her. You can see the few twists and turns in the plot coming miles before they happen. And all the illogical things start to get annoying very quickly. A guy who is alone on an island for years who doesn't know how to cook a fish and succeeds in burning it. And who puts the spare key to his home out in the open on the sill above the door in a place that is battered by gales almost weekly. A mobile phone that functions in the middle of nowhere. I expected a film with supernatural elements, but boy did I get fooled. Some of the photography and scenery was acceptable, but the CGI generated images of the lighthouse were done rather poorly. Alas, not a film that I can recommend to anyone.       
 'Nightmare City' aka 'City of the Walking Dead' aka 'Invasion of the Atomic Zombies' (by far the best title) is pretty much the most reviled film of the European zombie cycle of the early 80's.  I don't think this is entirely fair.  Personally, I think this movie is better than Mattei's 'Hell of the Living Dead'.  But, that ain't much of a prize, and this film is pretty damn lousy.  But, it's still worth seeing if you're a zombie fan.  So, as I always say, if you've even heard of this movie, you'll probably think seeing it is worth your time.  In some ways this film is slightly better than average.  The scenes not involving the zombies are relatively competent, perhaps slightly better than what you'd usually get in this sorta film.  None of the characters are remotely interesting, but the acting is not atrocious, if not good either, and the dialogue is rarely laughable. (Except for Anna's ridiculous, luddite social commentary.  And that's funny due to the content, rather than the delivery.)  The problem with this film is the zombies themselves.  Now,  I'm not a total zombie purist, but I can't call this a real zombie film.  I don't care that they run,  and I don't care that they aren't dead (or maybe they are. I forget.  Don't care either  way.)  The problem is that they always use weapons and tools.  Now, it's one thing to use these items sporadically, but they do it all the damn time.  For the most part, these supposed zombies just run up and stab people.  Not very zombie like.  Furthermore, they just aren't animalistic enough.  The fast zombies in '28 Days Later' and the new 'Dawn of the Dead' were at least wild and out of control.  These ones just seem like murderous people with gunk on their heads.  What it all comes down to is that these zombies are just lame.  They look terrible, with just some ridiculous lumpy crusty crud on their heads, at best, or just some black goo. Lame behavior and lame appearence= LAME.  I think if they'da made this with regular zombies it could've been a middle of the road zombie pic, and if they had some decent gore.  The gore in this is terrible, other than a few amusing exploding heads.  It's not especially gory for this sort of film either, though again, this isn't much of a loss considering the quality of it.  There's not too much else to say, it's just a lotta angry zombies running around cutting people up.  Reasonably amusing, but not much more than that.  The only really great moment is when a pack of zombies bursts in on an operation, and one surgeons flings a scalpel across the room and into one of the zombies necks.  That was pretty sweet.  Yeah, that's it.  Amusing, but just barely.  Grade: D 
 If you are looking for a good story and character development, this movie dissapoints. The story is rather thin and slow with more focus on Joe's good looks. A irritatating aspect of the DVD was white flashes occuring at  innapropriate moments during the movie 
 Baring the Calphalon name I was expecting something really nice, especially for the price I paid through Amazon of $84.95 - boy was I disappointed. Although Amazon is selling it as high-quality piece the Calphalon Contemporary Stainless 1-1/2-Quart Saucepan with Glass Lid is clearly on the cheaper side of the Calphalon brand. It looks like one of the pans Calphalon gives away to get you to purchase their higher end cookware. The item arrived nicely boxed in the Calphalon box but when I opened the box the pan looked like it had originally been a Return item before it was sent to me - The pot and lid were both in orginal packaging but the lid was clearly broken. It looked like someone had taken a hammer to it and stuck it back in the box and sent it on to me. Amazon has agreed to send a replacement at no charge but I can't believe they would have sent something like this to me to begin with without first inspecting what they send out. Unless it's being given to you as a "freebie" I suggest you save your money. 
 SHARP AND INSIGHTFUL.  A VERY SATISFYING LOOK BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF SECRECY THAT PREVAILS AT THE BUSH WHITEHOUSE 
 This was my first Ruth Rendell novel.  I picked it up after seeing her name appear with very high praise on a list of top psychological thriller reads.  Based on this novel, I'd call her more of a literary fiction mystery writer.  The action doesn't really pick up until the half-way point in the book, but then steadily increases to the strong ending.  I rated the book so low because I thought too much of the book (likely half) was superfluous narration to fill in the main characters's history.  I think I could have understood the position of both main characters without so much detail.  If it hadn't been for the list of thrillers to read, I might not have finished the book.  It began without a "hook", prompting me to read on, but I kept thinking that there must be more if she is such a prominent author.  Some day I might try another Rendell/Vine novel, but I'd make sure it came with plenty of hot reviews and a quicker pace 
 "Barbra: The Way She Is" isn't a biography so much as a 412-page National Enquirer story, offering more gossip than insight on its subject. The author and his editors don't even bother to check simple facts like who directed "Patton" and what was Jack Nicholson's debut movie, calling into question other assertions Christopher Anderson makes in his book, like all but claiming Streisand had affairs with Bill Clinton and Prince Charles. I'll admit I couldn't put the book down, but when I was done I wished I'd spent my time reading something else. 
 I described this novel to a friend as a mediocre novel that finally took a turn for the worse.  I kept hoping it would get better.  Each part, however, went further and further south.  Part 3, was ultimately, it's demise.  It felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Not the original, engaging Twilight Zone, but the new and contrived Twilight Zone.    With all of the great literature out there, this was a waste of my time 
 We are traveling the US for almost a year and have purchased the East as well as the West edition before we started. Besides the fact, that we found only a few nice spots described in those books so far, our comments are as follows:  1. The contents of both editions are outdated - certain camgrounds do    simply not exist any more for years!! 2. The directions are awful if not wrong 3. We spent more diesel on finding the described campgrounds than we saved     not to mention the hazzle, driving around in circles 4. Lots of directions seem to be copied from other books we have and are    as wrong as they are in those 5. Campgrounds indicated in the maps by numbers (icons) are not part of    the book anymore 6. The icons in the maps are close to impossible to read (use a    magnifier)  Overall we can absolutely NOT recommend those books to anybody 
 I suspect that somewhere out there a college-level course is given to all would-be college professors,a course in the fine art of lecturing with the aim of putting all but the most strong-willed student to sleep..Likewise,I suspect that there is a further course,for these same would-be college professors on how to write the most sleep-inducing texts possible..Surely if there are such courses given,Professor Gary Laderman MUST have excelled at the latter one,inasmuchas as his book"The Sacred Remains"stands as one of the most dry,boring,waste-of-time reads that I have ever encountered... The subject matter,"American attitudes toward death-1799-1883",while not exactly everyone's cup of tea,has nonetheless been dealt with better by a whole raft of earlier authors,writers who,unlike Laderman,have the reader in mind.."Popular"histories,on almost any subject,are usually frowned upon by the college-professor type of author..I don't know why this is,especially as it seems hard enough these days to get anyone to read anything beyond trashy novels,self-help books and get-rich-quick tomes..Making the material of one's book "live",making it interesting and easy to follow are the keys to succeeding at this task..One would think that a"teacher"might reasonably be expected to be able to do so,but,somehow,most such works fail...They are about as interesting to read as the telephone directory,and about as well written.. Laderman takes the subject of death and dying and submerges it in dry,boring text passages,often accentuated by unnecessary,three-dollar words..While he does scatter a selection of firsthand accounts about then-prevailing attitudes towards the beloved dead,or the funeral practices of the time,Laderman quickly swamps these often poingnant passages with his own overly-wordy,soperific text,thus deadening the whole effect,and leaving the reader on the point of sleep... Used as a textbook in some colleges,Laderman's tome represents what is wrong with such works on all levels;They are VERY BADLY WRITTEN,they take often interesting data and bury it in an avalanche of boring text,and are written by people who have no talent for the task... The old adage states;"Those who can,DO,and those who can't,TEACH"..Laderman's book is a prime example of the truth of this statemen 
 The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book.  
 A very well written disappointment.  I read to the last page, eager to see the storylines resolved, only to be abandoned by our writer, our tour guide; who seemed to jump ship on us.  I was interested in the characters, so the author succeeded in that.  But that's only half the journey.  I can only guess that the characters are symbolic of extremes within ourselves, from oblivious, to bitter to codependent.  The lesson might be that each extreme brings its own brand of sorrow, with a study of these extremes in character form.  Or maybe not.  But it takes the disappointment out of reaching the last page without resolution.  I love Tyler's work and admire her skill.  But if I'm going to read half a story, I'd like to pay half the price.  
 This is a book of Black Magic.  Do not be seduced into this type of foolishness.  Find the true Tantrism 
 Do yourself a favor... read FATHERLAND by Robert Harris instead if you like this sort of thing.  I was very, very disappointed with how predictable this book was.  It was written with the knowledge of what happened, but not written as if the characters didn't know what happened.  I give it a 2 stars instead of a 1 because I liked how Kerr handled some of his descriptions of Berlin, but I would not recommend Kerr, and this series, to anyone 
    This is an awful book from start to finish. It contains little historiography and is poorly written. Bentley spends a lot of space on the universities attended by historians and other useless details and not enough space explaining their ideas.        Bentely uses foreign phrases and block quotes on EVERY single page. At times he combines both beasts by having block quotes in a foreign language WITHOUT giving a translation.      But the last item may be preferable since Bentley is at his worst in his own language. The students in my class are always complaining about the writing. The professor is constantly apologizing for it. Maybe Bentley will do the same someday by revising this book. While this book is not a first draft, it is not a final one either. Good bye and good luck - or as Bentley would say, au revior and in bocca al lupo   
 The problem isn't with the unit taking a long time to chill a bottle of wine, the problem is that it doesn't chill a bottle of wine.  I put a bottle of room temperature Chablis in, and selected Chablis from the list of white wines. The unit said it would chill it to 46 degrees, and indicated that the starting temp was 77. That was my first concern, because the bottle was room temperature, and room temp was 70. The unit took more than 30 minutes to get the bottle to the desired temp (according to the units thermostats), but when I opened the bottle, the wine was probably a bit warmer than a pinot should be served at. I turned the unit off, placed the bottle back in (using the accompanying sleeve both time, btw), and this time the starting temp read 61 degrees. In other words, it disagreed with itself...  Soo...I chilled it again, for another 20 minutes, and upon reaching 46 (again) the bottle was no cooler than it was before.  I don't understand how these are selling. They are probably good for bringing room temp reds down to the appropriate serving level, but this simply does not chill white, rose, or sparkling wines to the desired temperature. So it's great, I suppose, for someone who doesn't have a wine refrigerator, or a cellar, but who wants to drink red wines at the appropriate temperature. It's terrible for anything other than that.  This is as disappointed as I've ever been with a product before 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 Graves confirms that the only way to learn of the Greek myths is to read what the Greeks themselves wrote. If the desire is to understand what the Greek myths actually mean then Graves should be avoided.  Robin Hard, in his translation to Apollodorus' Library of Greek Mythology, published by OUP, writes "the interpretive notes [to Graves' Greek Myths] are of value only as a guide to the author's personal mythology." (p.xxxiii). I cannot agree more.  Graves' immediate failure is that he remains oblivious to the ouranographic nature of Greek myth: their myths were related to the heavens. Further, Graves fails to understand the relationship of Greek myth to the development of Greek philosophy; that the key to understanding Greek philosophy, science (& hence mathematics & engineering), is the mythology. If you read Graves you will understand neither Greek myth or philosophy.  In Timaeus Plato wrote that when the creator "had compounded the whole he divided it up into as many souls as there were stars, and allotted each soul to a star." (Timaeus, 42).  In Apollonius' Argonautica we read of the argonaughts who paused as "the goddess Persephone sent up to them the mourning ghost of Aktor's son, who craved to see some men of his own kind ...[and having done so, he] Then sank down again into the great abyss." Book 2, lines 920.  In Homer's Odyssey we read that "Rose-fingered Dawn fell in love with Orion... outraged at her conduct... chaste Artemis rose from her golden throne, attacked him in Ortygia with her gentle darts and left him dead." Book 5, lines 121-124. When given directions for sailing, Odysseus kept his eyes "on the Pleiads...or the Great Bear [who] looks across at Orion the Hunter with a wary eye." Book 5, 272-274; and once in the Halls of Hades, which lie beyond the horizon, Odysseus' "eyes fell on the giant hunter Orion, ... armed with a club of solid bronze..." Book 11, 571-575  Aristotle explains to us what all this means: "From old - and indeed extremely ancient times there has been handed down to our later age intimations of a mythical character to the effect that the stars are gods... further details were added in the manner of myth." Metaphysics, Book Lambda, 1074b.  If you read Graves you will not encounter any understanding of the heavens, the basis of Greek myth, in which the planets and constellations were the detritus of times past, rendered immortal and writ large in the heavens. This absence is explained by Graves, when he extols his belief that even "the 13th century Excidium Troiae is, in parts mythically sounder than the Iliad." p. 13. What Graves claims is that an author who commented on the myths over 2000 years after Homer actually wrote down the myths, understood them better than the person who expounded them.  Instead of looking to the sky to understand these myths, Graves claims that the only way to properly understand them is when "archaeologists can provide a more exact tabulation of tribal movements in Greece and the dates." p.20; and that consequently "A large part of Greek myth is politico-religious history."(p.17). This is seriously misguided!  Graves as becomes evident has an agenda which he lays bare when he claims Greek & Jewish myth is a product of: "The Jews as inheritors of the 'Pelasgian', or Canaanitish, creation myth.." p. 35; that is that the people of Greece, before the arrival of Greeks were the same people as those who peopled Canaan (Palestine, which is utterly unsupported by any archaeology). What Graves attempts with this ridiculous tome, is to provide a syncretist misinterpretation of Greek myth to reconcile it with the irreconcilable Biblical beliefs and he imagines he achieves this when he weaves into this his "matrilineal v patrilineal" theory as some sort of corroboration. This explains why Graves claimed that a later, Greek Christian from Byzantium, wrote a sounder mythology than Homer: the Byzantine, being Christian, had the same disposition to reinterpret Greek myths to make them more acceptable to a Christian viewpoint, as does Graves.   Greek myths are beautiful if they can be understood. Graves omits the ouranographic dimension of Greek belief because, as he makes clear, he is actually attempting to reconcile it with Jewish (hence Christian) belief. No such reconciliation can work if the author is honest. The Greeks studied the heavens; the Jews were forbidden to do so on pain of death, eg. Deuteronomy 17.2-5 & Jeremiah 10.2. Graves' book is embarrassingly silly.  (... 
 I am by no means an economist, and much less an expert on finance, but this book strikes me as a thinly veiled, unsubtle hatchet job on the efficient markets hypothesis.  I've seen much subtler discussions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis written for general audiences, enough of them so I can recognize that Lowenstein doesn't get it; he equates efficient markets with "the price that the market offers is always the intrinsic value," and not with "you can't reliably predict intrinsic value any better than market prices themselves do."  This is a crucial difference, because it is only by assuming that market efficiency is the first that his attack holds water.  The other thing that makes me very suspicious about this book is the way Lowenstein presents the character of the various people involved in the story, given what his sources are.  Reading between the lines, I just have to wonder if his description of the personality and character of the people he describes as the core folks at LTCM is much too informed by interviews with people who've had a falling out with them 
 As a fan of Black Sabbath, I was disappointed in this book. Rosen had his chance to write a definitive book on Sabbath and failed miserably. His failure however left the door open for two other excellent books to be written. 1. HOW BLACK WAS OUR SABBATH by David Tangye and Graham Wright. (Yea!) 2. NEVER SAY DIE by Garry Sharpe-Young  To the reviewer who said about Rosen's book, there are no better books on Black Sabbath out there, I say bollocks! DO NOT buy Rosen's book until you have gotten HOW BLACK WAS OUR SABBATH and NEVER SAY DIE. Then if you are still hungry for more Sabbath books, I would recommend the Mike Stark book BLACK SABBATH AN ORAL HISTORY and lastly Steve Rosen's appropriately priced book 
 George G.M. Jones knows not a thing about real history. Claiming that the Great Library of Alexandria is where Aristotle took his knowledge is ludacris because the library was built by Ptolemy II. The Ptolemic line was the successor line in Egypt. Alexander, himself was crowned pharaoh by the people because they saw him as a liberator of Egypt. The priests of Egypt viewed him as the son of Zeus. These priests were of the god Ammon who were told at his oracle. The Egyptian Mysterey System was a creation of white men and is a proven hoax. The first Greek philosophers most likely had some knowledge of Babylonian and Egyptian thought they added reasoning, something none existant in Egyptian or Babylonian thought. Even saying that ancient Egyptians were all black is wrong, as the people of Egyptian constituted a mixture of races. They were black and white. They were in fact Semites, like the Jews and Arabs, people who are Caucasian. Skin color alone does not tell a man's race. An Indian from India is in reality Caucasian, making him closer to Europeans than the Japanese or Chinese. Even most the languages of India and Iran are Indo-European, while the Basque live in France and Spain but speak a language isolate. If the Greeks stole anything from anyone it was the Phoneicians and their alphabet, something that is the ancestor to the Greek, Latin, Etruscan, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets. The name Kemet was a reference to the black soil of Egypt. Today it is called Misr anyways.  
 After book 4 the series begins to meander around.  Characters are constantly side-tracked into meaningless, boring tasks.  The first 200-300 pages of this book are basically a re-hash of the previous books only excitement (Rand's capture and escape from the "bad witches") seen from different characters perspectives.  This is an example of what writing becomes when the author obviously has no idea of where the story is going, and there obviously is little or no editing.  The author must being paid by the word count and not the content.  The story seems to get written into little boxes, and has to be written back on track again and again.  I no longer have the patience to actually read each page.  I find myself skimming through to find some useful information or a single point of action.  The characters have also stalled out with Rand spending most of his time talking to him-self while the world goes to hell.  His big secret plan to quickly deal with one of the forsaken (started in the previous book) continues to drag on and on and on.....  This series had a good basic story.  Unfortunately you have to wade through crap to try and find it.  I'm beginning to wonder if the series will ever end 
 Used to be you could count on Oliver to deliver a solid album of guitar-based smooth jazz, uplifting tunes that made you reach for the volume control, tap your foot, and sing along to the lilting guitar lines.    This latest effort is his weakest to date, a mistitled album that seems to have been made on autopilot;  the only radiance to be found is in the backlight used in the cover art.  There's only one song here that rivals any of the best songs from his 2002 release, Positive Energy, a song called Good to Go that is in fact a pastiche of High Noon.   The rest of the album is uninspired smooth jazz.  Play it in the background and the only thing that will catch your attention are the three saccharine vocal tracks.  I give it a 2, instead of a 1, for being inoffensive background music.    If you haven't yet purchased any recordings from Steve Oliver, start with Positive Energy, one of the best contemporary jazz albums of the 00's.  Leave Radiant in the bin.  
 Really, the only keeper on this Volume is the first episode, "And When the Sky Was Opened" in which three astronauts crashland on Earth and are recuperating in the hospital. Things start to get weird when each in turn begins to disappear, as though Final Destination-like, they were not supposed to have survived the crash, and some force is trying to set things to rights after the fact. Rod Taylor plays the lead and along with his two co-stars give some brillant performances that convey terror without the ham. "In His Image" is an hour-long episode and runs an hour too long! Alan Talbot goes back to his small town birthplace with his fiance to introduce her to his family and finds it changed...like 20 years have gone by. And he also has these uncontrollable urges to kill. This episode felt like a rehash of earlier Zone and spirals down to a truly goofy ending that will leave you gasping "Whatever!". "The Last Night of the Jockey" showcases an aging Mickey Rooney as an aging jockey named Grady who's played with the rules and Pete Rose-like betted on races one time too many. He's been banned from racing and has no idea what to do with his life except drink it away. That is, until a face in the mirror who claims he's his "alter-ego" and can grant him any wish he desires starts talking to him! I thought Rooney's performance was great in this one-man show with one set, but the story just wasn't compelling enough to keep me from getting bored. 
 I got this book from the library and was reading it with my daughter. The illustrations are wonderful and overall it is a good introductory to evolution for kids. However I find it unbelieveable that the author describes the appearance of the primate/human "common ancestor" as being descended from apes. For someone who thinks himself knowlegable enough to be writing educational books for any age on the theory of evolution this "mistake" is unforgivable.  Considering the idea is the most repeated falsity used by ignorant opponents of evolution. You are not helping to educate children by feeding them ignorance. It`s enough to keep me from reading anything else written by this author 
 If you know anything about Army aviation or Apaches, Fire Birds will either tick you off, or make you laugh till you puke. This was supposed to be the Army's Top Gun? So sad. It's so unrealistic, I wish the Army had had veto power on this one before it was released. 
 This is not a biography but rather a discussion of each of Hitchcock's films. For each film there is: - Detailed synopsis - Cast and Crew details - Analysis of the film  These first two of these items can be obtained from the Internet for free and who really wants to know the details of the story anyway? The analysis of each film is largely a waste of time as Spoto tends to over-analyse each film to the point of distraction while offering no real insights.  If you want to find out more about Hitchcock's films I would recommend McGilligan's excellent biography. This discusses each film in the context of Hitchcock's life and career and is far more illuminating 
 Looking at the liner photos makes clear that Falkner is the prettiest thing this side of N Sync (and doesn't he know it, especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of Johnnie Walker Black by a leggy Bunny Flight Attendant).  Which raises the question: is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an ARTIST?  Not to put too fine an edge on it, let's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent.  Falkner does everything on the CD and my reaction is so what?  His voice is mediocre; his lyrics are banal ("Life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness") or precious ("Suspended on this stage of grace I have to remember this sound"); the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound, with a disspiriting sameness song after song.  Give him two stars simply because he CAN do all the stuff on the record, but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to, say, Chrissie Hynde and John Hiatt CDs.  We'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs 
 This book purports to change our view of the revolution by exposing things that no one ever knew.  However in general in 95% of all American public schools students are today taught that Paul Revere didn't do his ride, that Washington was a brutal slave owner in it for money, and that Jefferson was a hypocrite.  Every American revolutionary is described as greedy and wrong in their cause, every ideal is either hypocrisy or not true.  In general the line of teaching and thinking today is that the American revolution and the basis of the constitution and American values is all evil and bad and based on ulterior motives.    This book is just continuing this anti-American theme of revising American history.  However this book pretends it is a lonely voice in the dark, but in general most of us already know what is being said her.  Most people are aware that the Native Americans joined the British side and were brutalized at wars end.  Most are aware that their were extremes and their was a racial aspect to the war and a class aspect and that it degenerated into a civil war so much so that Ben Franklins son joined the English.  Who is not aware of these things.  There is little new information here, accept perhaps a little bit more time spent explaining how perhaps it would have been better had American continued to be occupied by the British government and imperial Britain continued to tax Americans without representation and continue to force the church of England down every American throat and discriminate against Jews and other minorities.  American revolutionaries had many qualities to be admired, in some ways they were more progressive then politics today, their ideals were more utopian then ours, in the end American revolutionaries were people to be admired not spit upon the way this book does.

 Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less 
 Come on, Mark.  8 editions. Still no singers. Have Vaughan, Fitzgerald, Holiday, et al. contributed nothing to the art 
 I guess for one thing- this soundtrack's only really made notable due to the inclusion of the original theme from the old television cartoon series, and the vamped out rendition of AEROSMITH, which the RAMONES have covered as well (but is not included in the soundtrack - nor does it appear on the movie).  Welp, this soundtrack includes a lot of tracks that are not only irrelevant- but hadn't even appeared in the movie; with a number of them coming from those dorky/unknown kind of bands which runs in the commercialized vein with a stolen format taken from the unsung SIZE 14 -- from the likes of BLEU; SUM 41 (who 'sings' "Rock- that's what we're all about; that's what we live for, comon shout it out" when obviously they dont live what they're yapping at -cos they rap. Rap aint rock- it's crap!); DEFAULT with a track called 'Blind' (when we're not talking about the soundtrack for DAREDEVIL aren't we); the disgusting GREENWHEEL which vies for a MATCHBOX 20 swouwnd with its vowculliestth (it's vocalist Rob Thomas he aint- maybe wanting to charm chicks same way the said Thomas did); that passe band called THE STROKES who tries to emulate BECK's sound (which would've amounted to nothing if not for 'Loser'); and THEORY OF A DEAD MAN singing about 'The Invisible Man'- which is not that bad really, its just that the track could've been rendered the invincible instead, cos Spidey didn't have any invisibility powers y'know. Let alone Harry Potter.       It would've been a better deal for the movie and the soundtrack as well if they'd featured that fabulous ozzy band MIDNIGHT OIL doing a rendition of their own 'King of the Mountain' - on that scene where The Green Goblin made his first appearance in the flick by attacking the launching party for OsCorp, instead of that annoying vocal performance of Macy Grey.  Other notable tracks in the soundtrack of sorts are the ones from THE HIVES (who would've been fitting if its a soundtrack about the MOTH MAN ~kidding), and contributions from posers by the likes of CHAD KROEGER and COREY TAYLOR.  Real notable tracks are those from ALIEN ANT FARM (who would've been fitting for A BUG's LIFE or maybe for the ANT MAN if a movie'd come around for this old comic book hero would come by if ever hehehe); rival-to-STP's ALICE IN CHAINS vocalist Jerry Cantrell and from Pete Yorn (who also appeared on a RAMONES tribute album), plus my real favourite in the soundtrack is the track from INJECTED called 'IV-V-VI'.  However, Danny Elfman did a fine rendering of the score (which is released in full through the Spidey movie score soundtrack album (such clever marketing gimmicks thus)) mainly with the Main Title track, and it's a neccessary thing for Elfman considering that a lot are beggining to label his music as monotunous, mainly through his works for Tim Burton's movies. They could've rather set the songs with Elfman's songs on a single soundtrack album, and in my crummy opinion - what should've been in the album are the following:  IN SEQUENCE/ORDER of TRACKS= 1) Spider Man theme 2) Spider Man theme RAMONES 3) Main Title theme DANNY ELFMAN     add there 4) CHAD KROEGER and 5) COREY TAYLOR's 6) ALIEN ANT FARM 7) THE HIVES     contributions    cos reportedly they are really intended for the film as meant      -and 8) INJECTED 9) MIDNIGHT OIL's rehash of 'King Of The Mountain' 10) JERRY CANTRELL's 11) AEROSMITH's theme version 12) Farewell DANNY ELFMAN   along with his other score tracks - plus I guess a contribution for the GREEN GOBLIN's Theme would've sufficed and that it would be commisionned that the said track would be a contribution from Ozzy Osborne.  Other artist who would've been fitting to appear in the soundtarck would be: TORI AMOS, BJORK, CHEAP TRICK, U2, and STING. Furthermore, I guess it would've been okey as well if they'd JOAN OSBORNE also as commisioned to do a retake of her song 'Spider Web' for this soundtrack and've pulled out to inlude the old NO DOUBT tune of the same title from their early works.  And in passing - howzabout one of those tracks from the old 70's indie issued SPIDERMAN: Rock Reflections of a SuperHero record (with Stanley's narration) like 'No One's Got A Crush On Peter'... or at least if it'd appeared a bit as a background on the movie.   
 be prepared that most of (but not all of) the stories are fantasy (made up lands and places or dream, etc), and not realistic....probably a lovely collection if that's what you're looking for.  also, mine was bound up-side-down and backwards....anyone elses?? 
 Coffee is a brown beautiful color.Ink is black set to a white back ground in books for a very good reason.If I had known the printing in this book was a light brown color that is hard to read I would not have wasted my time or money.This may be a very good book but I will never know.Keep the color in the coffee and your hands off the ink.I have the fifth edition 
 Great idea for a story - but just an "ok" book that could have been so much better 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 I just read The Divide by the author of the Horse Whisperer, and I wanted to share my opinion of the Horse Whisperer. I did not read the book; I saw the movie, a couple of years ago.  I just remember it being very hoakie, one of the worst movies I had ever seen.  I know that it drew some critical acclaim and that it was popular with the public, but I did not share this enthusiasm.  Don't waste your time on this ridiculous movie 
 Denying the suffering of Christians under Moslem rule is what Said wants the West to do.  The denial of Christian suffering by Christians who lived among Moslems is a phenomenon that is always overlooked.  As Christians who live in Egypt, neither Said nor I could marry a Moslem woman unless we convert to Islam; as Christians neither Said nor I would be allowed entrance to some Arab cities; as Christians, neither Said nor I would be allowed to build a church without permission from the President of Egypt.  Why is Said quiet about that 
 Basically became a "b.seller" thanks to the publisher buying ten of thousands of books. Trickery and deceipt are the name of the game.  However so many people lost $$ because of the empty analysis, made up terms and let's face it ignorance 
 I think that this is a great idea and a very cute plush, but I immediately encountered some problems with the toy that I think are worth mentioning.  First, the battery box is very poorly designed.  Once you have opened the velcro cavity in the dog's tummy, it's nearly impossible to keep it closed again.  The dog's hairs get caught in the velcro and the battery box is too big so the cavity keeps busting open.  Now, if I handle the toy, the box keeps falling out!   My second comment is that the sound effects are pretty bad.  The sounds quality is poor and it doesn't always sound like a dog 
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I enjoy all types of books and was looking for something light and entertaining as a break from heavier reading. The characters were totally unbelievable and shallow. The book was supposed to be a mix of sci-fi, suspense, and romance. The sci-fi part was fun, I'll admit. The suspense consisted of a mediocre crime plot, that was very graphic and disturbing in its description. The romance was nonexistent, unless you consider gratuitous sex scenes romantic. I know that Nora Roberts is known for the "steamy sex scenes" in her books, but these scenes were just stuck in there for the sake of their steaminess. They had no connection to the story whatsoever. The relationship between the protagonist and her husband was based solely on sex. What made this especially unbelievable was the fact that the main character was a survivor of abuse/incest. I'm no expert, but you'd think somebody with this type of background would have a few issues regarding sex/intimacy. I just thought the book was awful. Flat characters, silly predictable mystery. I left it on the train and feel sorry for the poor soul who picks it up 
 I used this text a few years ago when I was writing a paper on ethics of pesticide use, and it certainly details information well. However, the general tone is often anal and the writing style is extremely drab. Most of  the diagrams included were generated using low-budget graphics software,  and  it shows.  At 811 pages, this is an overly long book and not all the  chapters (24 total) can be covered in a single Echem course. Also, there is  no solutions manual and the problems Manahan gives are challening (a  section of numerical solutions placed in the back of the text would have  been nice...)  This is a good reference text, but  if you're looking for a  semester-long or short-term text to use for an Echem course, use Baird's  text, not Manahan's 
 Lahaye once again showed his weak eschatology and also shows he rehashes the poor "research" done by other bible "teachers".  While I know the pre tribulation rapture is proved in the bible, very few pre-tribulation "teachers" have studied for themselves and do not see what is clearly taught in the bible.  Instead of doing their own research, they rehash and regurgitate the poorly researched articles and books written by extremely poor researchers.  Lahaye is guilty of rehashing poor research taught by other "teachers".  Lahaye is also guilty of changing what the bible clearly teaches and has deceived millions.  One example of his false teaching is that someone can take the mark of the beast and still be saved and go to heaven.  This DOWNRIGHT LIE has deceived people into thinking that 'taking the mark' is 'no big deal'.  All his books show the tribulation is "no big deal" and people can go on living fairly normally while judgements are happening (seems he doesn't think antichrist will turn off cell phones, electricity, or internet if they refuse his mark)  I will restate that the bible clearly teaches a pretribulation rapture - only none of the 'POPULAR' bible "teachers" do their own research so they never publish the clear teachings of a pre tribulation rapture.  Lahaye has done more to deceive the world than most people do - and he will be rewarded severely for his works.  Remember - Jesus said if the world loves someone, they are not His - because the world will hate those that are His as they hate Him.  Popularity of ANY bible "teacher" should be suspect because of what Jesus said.  Lahaye is a false teacher teaching deception that closely mimics the truth (just enough to be believed by most 
 When I was a little kid, I'd see this book on the shelves at the library and in used bookstores and wonder what masterful tale was contained inside, and yet somehow I never managed to pick it up. 20 years later I finally splurged and got it for a dollar at the library book sale, and read the whole thing cover to cover on a transpacific flight.  Oh, man! What I had been missing! Some of the worst dialogue ever committed to paper, the most appalling junk science since "The Core," and gratuitous sex scenes that made me actually laugh out loud. Dirk Pitt is like Doc Savage -- only twenty times smarter and stronger! The fact that this one reached the NY Times bestseller list makes you question the fate of humanity.  Good for a laugh or two, especially with some of the utterly ludicrous scenes near the end (don't forget that sultry strip-tease, seemingly written by a ten-year-old), but probably not worth it in the long run unless you're a fast reader 
 The book is like an ocean, poorly organised. No pictorial representations (which I think is very important when we discuss data modeling). I bought this book to refresh my data modeling knowledge-- disappointing. May be useful for some students to clear some papers, for pros - please find something else.  
 I loved Ms. Ramsland's book "Cemetary Stories" so I was really looking forward to reading about her foray into the Vampire Culture in search of a "real" Vampire. All she found was a lot of sad lonely individuals of questionable sexual persuasion who engaged in 'Vampiric Costume Drama" for the sole purpose of having a sexual encounter. One gets the feeling that these poor misguided individuals could all benefit from a  great deal of Therapy and/or some Heavy Duty Medication.Even Ms. Ramsland becomes jaded with these poor folk by the end of the book.One gets the feeling that it would be easier to find a 'real" Vampire working the Graveyard Shift at your local 7/11 than in all of the S&M clubs she visited. 
 This is a full screen, heavily cut version of the original Quiemada movie by Pontecorvo. Would you read an edition of Moby Dick or The Red and the Balck missing 1/8 of its pages? A missed opportunity to watch this great movie as it was supposed to be watched 
 Native Son is a book that I was required to read for school. I had high hopes for the book , but they were dashed as I read on. The writing style is extremely sub-par. Wright struggles to get his point across succinctly. The book is characterized by muddled and repetitive narrative. I kept trying to like the character of Bigger throughout the novel, but I was unable to do so. His apparent lack of remorse for his actions is apalling. The argument that his fear and society is the cause of his murders can only apply to his murder of Mary Dalton. His willingness to profit from the murder and sense of pride about it afterword is sick. I see no literary value in this book. We read it because in public schools today we are forced to read literature about how America is racist towards blacks every year. Schools try to jam the theme of racism against blacks down our throats every year in an effort to "emotionally move us" and make us feel guilty for something that occurred long before we were born. I assure you that this book would not have achieved the title "classic" if the author was white. In America we ignore the plight of other ethnic groups and focus solely on the cause of the African American. I get the point we studied it enough already. 
 The message of this book is simple: if you want to run better, simply run like Haile Gebr. Of course, there's no hint as to how to run like Gebr, but there are pretty pictures and oodles of "ideas" which totally lack any sort of flesh. The book is sporadic, repetitive and offers no useful examples. The concept of a new, almost holistic approach to running is interesting, but almost completely unexplored after the introduction.  I've attempted many of the techniques and found my running to quickly become less enjoyable, more labored and a lot slower. I'm an advanced runner and found only a handful of quotes to be useful. I see almost no purpose at all for a novice runner to read between these covers 
 Roger Scruton is a polemical kind of philosopher, in many ways similar in style to John Searle. When Scruton does philosophy, it's a joy to read.  But as others have complained, the philosophy in this book is a frame for Scruton to do Christian apologetics. If that's what one wants, it's not a bad book. Personally, Scruton's Christianity doesn't have much appeal for me. And the philosophical issues can get sidelined.  If you're really interested in philosophy, Scruton's "Modern Philosophy" is a better place to look. No Christian apologetics, just philosophy. It's both an introduction and survey with Scruton's usual acerbic comments. Personally, the work is directed more toward intermediate philosophy readers than naive ones. But as a general introduction and survey, Scruton does himself very well.   For a basic and broader introduction to philosophy, Robert Solomon's "Introducing Philosophy" with original texts and commentary is certainly to be preferred, but the price is outrageous 
 This is not one of the better entries to this series. After successfully balancing an intriguing mystery with an important wedding in "Rituals of the Season" it is disappointing to have this story be such a mismash. In this book, readers are finally introduced to Dwight's ex-wife and his son, Cal, but there is no development of either as characters. This is such a strong point to Maron's writing--evocative descriptions of people and places--that it disconcerting to put down this book and not feel like I have just been on a trip to North Carolina (or Virginia.) The characters are flat and unlikeable, the "mystery(s)" are odd and the plot just isn't there.  Still, any Margaret Maron/Deborah Knot mystery is better than none, and the actions in this story will have an impact on Deborah and Dwight's future, but don't read this expecting a thrilling or clever mystery; read it as a segue to the next book in the series 
 I am super busy and don't normally write a review on anything!  But this book is sooooooooo baaaaaad that I felt compelled. The author provides almost no real informtion and continuously berates the reader to "start a consumer advocacy group" to do this and that. For my $25 I would have rather donated it to a consumer advocacy book to prevent the publication of awful books like this one! And to think this lady has written 36 books! If Ms Hart's book were required reading by criminals, we wouldn't need the death penalty! the prisoners would all commit suicide 
 Jenne has some fun, creative and original ideas for cake decorating. Yes, they do look a bit sloppy, but then these are not the usual "Wilton" frosting daisies and roses. The reason for just 2 stars is some of the recipes aren't very good with questionable instructions. For example, the one for Chocolate Granache calls for UNSWEETENED chocolate and cream. That's it. And it's absolutely vile tasting. I ended up using Jacques Pepin's recipe from his "La Technique" cookbook. And the Konditor cake needs a special Croquembouche mold which will set you back about $90-$110. I think this book is for more experienced bakers who can spot a questionable recipe, but then they probably have better cookbooks in their libraries 
 I liked it, its a very good Bukowsky type of story, however its juts like 5 pages long, and its way to expensive, and if u add postage, wow i payed way too much for 1 story! i wish i would have seen it at a library i would have just read it there in 5 minutes... 
 This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.  Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.  This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this.  
 This by my account is one of the worst debacles in Reba McEntire's career.  These song would be better fitting for Kelly Clarkson or Britney Spears or Paula Abdul rejects from the eighties.  WIth titles like "Up and Flying" and "Invisible" what can you expect?  Certainly not good old three chord, hard core steel and fiddle country.  Its a shame that such a talent as Reba's should be wasted on such banal tripe as this.  
 There was enough redemption and entertainment in the first 2 books to have me reading the third, but what a way for Sinjun to go!  I liked Sinjun, I liked Colin, the Scottish adventure and running away from the overprotective brothers is great... So why does our Strong and Manly hero have to ruin it all by subjugating the eager and talented Sinjun to HORRIBLE sex.  And later in the book when Sinjun decides to "let" her husband hurt her, it's DISGUSTING.  Having a man force sex on a woman is NOT romantic!  Rewrite the book to take out the rape and I would love it 
 If this is your first beading book you might find useful information here. If you've been beading for some time this book offers nothing, the projects are way too simple, more for kids than adults. It feels that the author is only starting with beading herself, she has not learned enough to teach others. There are so much better beading books out there, don't waste your money on this 
 First off I don't care that they signed with G-Unit I could give a f**k. It is just there lyrics are getting weaker. Putting 50 on the tracks don't really help anything. They along with the rest of the crew talk about the same subjects things they got, money and hoes. Man rap has gotten dipressing. The second problem I have is P's verse on Pearly Gates, I am religous and I think it's retarted to be talking down on anyones religion. I won't hold these against him because he just speakin his mind but it is still wrong to be talkin like that. 2/5 Only real good track is Put Em In They Place. 
 This may be a wonderful show and I think it is great that a lot of old TV shows are now available on DVD... BUT I was either three or four years old when I first saw this on TV, no doubt one of my older sisters was watching, and it scared the crap out of me. I will admit I was taken with Marina because she was so pretty but I'm 42 years old and to this day I am scared of puppets and mannequins, also large dolls creep me out..I don't know if this is so great for real little children. 
 you will dig this. I heard a song on the radio called Your Blood or In Your Blood. I agree it is catchy, but to me, it is about satanic worship and jealousy of God and his people. Sorry but Satan loses and you can't play with the devil. You are what you eat. Write that one. :- 
 I don't even know what to say about this book other than anyone who pretends to like this nonsense deserves to read it. Truman Capote's quote about Kerouac's writing, "That it's not writing, it's typing," probably sums up the matter better than anything I can say.  What disappoints me I suppose is that I really want to like Kerouac - I love the idea of him, though I can't say I care much for his typing. 
 ... pertraits of life in graduate medical education.  This text certainly has its place as the experiences of a female doctor, but all told it was rather innocuous 
 The only reason I gave this book one star is because there is no zero level, as far as I can tell.  I was disappointed. I was annoyed. I was bored. I was irritated. Then I was impressed because if this could get published, ANYbody can get published.   There are, theoretically, two plots in this book. Neither plot ties in with the other. The second plot is so secondary that it is forgotten for chapters at a time by the author. I only wish we could have forgotten the main plot, and I use the word "plot" only as a point of reference.   ESP, mysticism, ghosts, real magic; a protagonist who could be a woman, or who could be a woman who can magically - yes, magically - turn into a man. Or really, we aren't sure. It's like at the end of the book, Coulter looked up, realized "gosh darn, end of the book already? I'd better slap together an ending!" and that's what we have. I actually wondered if my book had lost some pages, I was that confused and bewildered.   Also, we meet a character in this book who will return in another book in this series, a cousin of the serial killers Tammy and Tommy Tuttle (Tammy, of course, maybe being Tammy or possibly Tommy or Timmy or magically changing into Tommy or Timmy; we aren't sure and trust me, eventually you won't care). In the later book, this cousin is nice and we are empathetic with her. In this book, I didn't care if she got killed or drowned on her way to Bermuda. In fact, I wouldn't have cared if the whole cast of characters had drowned on the way to Bermuda or been killed by the weird ghosts that the Tuttle siblings feed with blood from victims.   That's "ghosts" as in real ghosts, by the way.  My complaint is that the rest of the books in this series are mostly based in factual, believable actions. This book - I have no idea what happened with this book. Probably one of the worst plotted books I've ever tried to read. And that's sad, because a good Coulter FBI series book is a page-turner and a joy to read. 
 I bought this vacum at Target nearly six months ago. It has a very strong suction, and runs relatively quiet, but it cost a fortune to maintain! The root cause for this maintainence is that Dirt Devil designed this machine to use the Hepa filter as a vacum bag. All the dirt raps itself around the filter until its completely crapped up, and if you use it beyond that stage it will completely shut-down. I call customer service about it, and they recommended that I clean the filter more frequently. Which I now do, but I still have to replace the filter on average once every 2 months or else I'm force to breath all the fine particles that the Hepa is suppose to protect me from. The cost of each filter is an appauling $30 bucks. My car filter doesn't cost more than $7 dollars. At this rate I've already bought the vacum cleaner within my six months of use. Save yourself the hassel. Don't buy it! 
 Although I had to read this book for a school assignment, I was all eager and ready to enjoy it. My teacher had greatly enjoyed this series, and had infused me with her own enthusiasm, so I picked up this book with high expectations. Boy, was I disappointed. In addition to being very poorly written, and employing terrible grammar, this book was incredibly boring and slow-paced. I don't usually mind a quiet, or slow-developing story, if it is well-written and interesting, but this was neither- it was simply a sleeper. It wasn't that I didn't try- I really did attempt to like the book, and to interest myself in it. However, my efforts were in vain, and as I read I often found myself falling into a stupefied trance, where I would read five to ten pages, and not take in a word. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get this book to interest me. It wasn't only the plot and the bad writing that disappointed me- the characters weren't much either. Bland, boring, monotonous and one-dimensional, it was incredibly hard to distinguish one from the other. The one exception was Will, the main character, who could only be distinguished by his incredibly self-centered attitude, his extreme selfishness, his disgusting self-pity, and his revolting egotism. I wouldn't have minded these traits so much if by the end of the book he had undergone some character development, and perhaps confronted his faults and become a better person. However, this did not happen, and he remained the same unlikeable person from beginning to end. Overall, I would not reccommend this book to any but those who are suffering from extreme insomnia- and even then, a big mug of chamomile tea is better than this book 
 I read this book when I was actually in Borneo where I spent over a year, visiting many of the places described in the book. I found it plainly ridiculous! The real Borneo is nothing like the mystical "deepest-darkest" fantasy-world described in this story, nor was it even when those travels were supposedly taking place... It is amazing that this book got such good marks from other readers and probably the best example of how many high tales a writer can get away with about far-away places where most readers haven't been. :-)  A more realistic description of the same places on a similar trip could be read in "A Stroll Through Borneo" by James Barclay 
 Ragnar's worst book ever. I own and value six others by him. Devoid of useful information except for one concept, veterinarian medicines = human medicines, no prescription needed, dosages vary - check PDR, visit your local farm supply store 
 Although in some ways provocative, this book poses a question it never adequately grapples with--namely, can the "materiality" of race be properly characterized or understood as a "discursive limit" to ideological constructions of ethnicity without being understood as existing outside of discourse? It seems to me that Eng fails to address the question of whether such constructions may be regarded as either a pre- or extra-discursive "hard kernel of the Real," one the one hand, or simply another aspect of discourse, on the other hand. His work would benefit from a more thorough engagement with, and analysis of, the "objet petit a" in the work of Zizek and Lacan.  Perhaps "race" in general ought to be regarded a primordial psychic "hole," an "absence" or pure negativity where a "grounding" for discourse ought to be but proves to be lacking.  Unfortunately that is a proposition that Eng hints at but does not explore. 
 A thousand blood-thirsty Trollocks are on the way to kill you and your friends.  At your disposal you have the following choices of weapon:  1. The Troll-Kill 2000 which can kill 50 to 100 Trollocks at a time, has unlimited power, never misses, and never needs to be recharged.  2.  A machine gun which is not as effective as the Troll-Kill 2000, but still pretty good, or 3.  A pocket knife, which is great for cleaning your fingernails, but not very effective in stopping a Trollock.  If you are Rand you pick the pocket knife of course, but then either forget to take it with you, or vow not to use it unless you are absolutely sure the Trollocks are not female.    So Jordan has created a superhero with super powers.  He gave the superhero super weapons.  Then he realized that if the superhero uses his power or his weapons there will be no way to stretch this series from 6 books (what it should have been) to 12 books.  Solution:  make the superhero too stupid to use his powers or weapons, and fill the rest of the pages with useless drivel.    The books are filled with darkfriends, and other servants of the Dark Lord, that never seem to do anything, but watch from the sidelines.  They don't really need to do anything, since the good guys seem to pretty much muck everything up on their own.    The problem with creating 1000s of characters in gory detail is that you expect them to actually do something.  The other problem with so many characters is that you loose track of them and lose focus of the main characters.  When Jordan finally comes back to a particular character, they seem to have been placed in suspended animation for the past 1000 pages.  I dare you to try to read this one without a heavy dose of caffeine in your system. 
 They should have titled it "Locked in the Arms of a Terrible Author." That would have been a more fitting title for this aweful book 
 What a complete pain! ..... We now use Macs. However, I decided to take the California bar examination July 2006. The California bar examiners allow the use of laptops utilizing a software program written by Examsoft. Presently, the software will only work on Windows XP. Moreover, the California bar examiners will not allow any Macs, even the newer Macs with the Intel processors which require complete re-booting into Windows.  As a result, I was forced to upgrade my Gateway laptop, a fine laptop as far as PCs are concerned, in order to sit for this bar examination. (That, or purchase a new laptop, which was probably the point.) THANK GOD FOR GATEWAY COMPUTER TECHNICAL SUPPORT AS THE MICROSOFT FOLKS ARE CLUELESS:  Even though the warranty on my Gateway laptop expired some time ago, Gateway has walked me through more issues during the installation process than I can possibly discuss here. Conversely, Microsoft simply bounces me around from one tech support person to the next until the telephone becomes disconnected. .....  I suspect that the marketing strategy is that new software (any new software) will only work with the newer versions of Windows XP or Vista, and since Vista will be such a memory hog, consumers eventually will be forced to dump their PCs which cannot be upgraded, for new PCs.  As for how the operating system actually works: a grade of Fair. YESTERDAY, THE MICROSOFT UPDATE WEBSITE WAS DOWN WHICH, ACCORDING TO MICROSOFT'S DISCUSSION WEBSITE SEEMED TO BE A PROBLEM WITH OTHER WINDOW USERS AS WELL. Typical 
 I found this book to be very disappointing, expecting as I did a balanced and sympathetic rendition of the sufferings of Germans in the post-war period.   The author's reference in the acknowledgements section to his visits to Israel and to his consequent "moral responsibilities" in writing this book should have set alarm bells ringing from the start. This was always going to be a book emphasising the Holocaust over every other tragedy of the war. A distinctly Jewish-orientated point of view. The basic tenet of the book boils down to one reiterated position; the Germans who were as a nation guilty of war crimes did not sufficiently atone for their sins. The churches and political parties colluded with the people to transfer the legitimate victimhood of the Jews to that of the undeserving post-war Germans. Returning POWs were surprisingly more anti-communist than when they embarked on Operation Barbarossa. An extremely ungrateful and dangerous position to hold after the generosity of Soviet internment.  The use of German POWs as slave labour is callously summed up by Biess as a decision "to employ former German soldiers for the purpose of reconstruction(p45)". Nearly a million German civilians were also forcibly put to work after their abduction of whom nearly 45% perished ("A Terrible Revenge" AM de Zayas). Biess is silent on this. Although Biess does admit that 33% of Germans died in Soviet captivity (compared to 4% of Allied prisoners in German captivity)  apparently this was "not the result of a deliberate Soviet policy of mass killing or even of passive negiligence." Tell that to the 105,000 German POWS who survived Stalingrad only to die in Soviet captivity. A mere 5,000 survived from the doomed Fifth Army. I would term that a mass killing by any standards.  The expulsion of 11 million ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe, of whom 2 million died in the process, is described as a "necessary" population transfer (p44). Apparently evidence of the mass rape of German women by the Soviet army remains "sparse" (p60). Perhaps he has not read Anthony Beevor's book "Berlin: The Downfall 1945" which chronciles the mass rape of Eastern German women by the drunken Soviet troops. The indiscriminate carpet bombing of cities with the loss of nearly a million innocent lives counts as nothing next to the murder of the Jews. This is the mantra which this mendacious and agenda-ridden book seeks to promote. The sad thing is that many propagandised Europeans, including the new generation of self-loathing and obeisant Germans, would concur with this politically-motivated viewpoint. To quote de Zayas "Seldom is there any compassion for the vanquished. Seldom any justice in retribution." This book wallows in this ignoble tradition.   
 At least I bought the edition that only cost 4 dollars.  Otherwise it would've been a big waste of money.  The writing is contrived and stunted.  The flow of the story line did not feel natural.  The author's idea of description is to begin and end with: Such-and-such "was soooooooo beautiful."    It begun very well but soon degenerated into a bunch of boring nonsense.    Note to the author: CapitalizingEverything and NotPuttingSpacesBetweenThem does not make it SoundImportant or Interesting.  BTW E.K.M. Ljung I loved your review.  "(StarMan? StarDrifter? TypingAuthorWomanWithComputer?)"  I laughed very hard 
 Skimmed through the book...did not have to read this one. If you ever visited match.com, you will discover she writes a column for finding love over 40. She uses all of her book there...she quotes from it extensively. Women write in saying they don't want a man with kids...she tells them they are too picky, the kids could be dolls and she is throwing away a man who can commit (no, he can reproduce...big difference.) One said he was fat, a smoker (lied about both) and had raging BO...she suggested staying with him and nudging him toward a healthy lifestyle and deodorant(if a grown man cannot figure out basic hygiene, that is not the woman's problem...and vice versa.) One met a man who was unemployed...she told her to give him a chance because things happen sometimes and he could be a prince in a frog's life(there are men and women happy to mooch though, why waste time?)  Yes she has one point I agree with--some people set their standards way too high...oh he has a slightly receding hairline...Gotta run. I want someone who makes 75K or more, and his last tax return said 74K...hittin' the road. Her column and book are asking women to overlook flaws and hide who they are, not diminish a perfectionist streak. Besides, those who crave perfection in a mate are subconsciously pushing relationships away anyways and won't be reading this book.   No one would write a book to men and say "if she reeks, give her a chance, she could be a sweetie." "If she is ugly/fat/unsightly she may have a heart of gold and you are being too picky." "If she hates your dog, get rid of the dog if you want a wife." Most men I know would ditch the chick for the dog...a wise choice to me. My dog and cats have outlasted every relationship I have had because relationships are about mutual compromise...not one person giving up him/herself to cause a fake mesh with someone else.  You don't need to read the book to know her premise...settle for what you can get after 35. I think I will pass again...if Rachel paid for Harvard, clearly she was not planning to settle for any business school. Why settle when it comes to something that is supposed to last longer than 3 years?   
 This is just one in a long line of "yeah I have a baby but that's not going to affect my life one bit" books.  As others have mentioned, her breastfeeding section is just sad.  If the author wants to use formula, that's fine.  No reason to bash moms who nurse.  Can't recommend this book at all 
 it's unbelievable how we can find, nowadays, people who call themselves "maoists". There is no logic. Maoism is violence and pure dictatorship... this book is a book of slogans and people who love a book  like this are looking for slogan and not for political consciousness. Try  Gramsci, it's really bette 
 I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.    The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly 
 There was no indication that this product was not available and when expecting to receive notification that it was shipped, I received notice that it was not only not being shipped, but was unavailable and would not be recieved, EVER 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 I'm not sure who these people are that are rating this book so highly. This is probably the worst book written on the subject. Want to know how to implement a Tracking Service? How about a persistence service? Maybe you'd like to see a simple example of how to implement workflow? Well if so, then DON'T get this book. This book tells you none of this. This book is about what's under the hood. It's similar to seeing what's under the hood of IIS or Exchange. Who cares? I want to know how to use it, not how pretty the system is. I would return this book in an instant if I could.   
 This book is bad stuff because it doesn't emphasize eternal damnation in Hell.  Without Hell and eternal damnation, God did not have to take on human flesh to die in a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.  John Stott really needs to read his Bible carefully.  How could someone who doesn't understand this be saved? 
 I really wanted to like this game, but there are serious problems with the version that comes in the blue box.  1. The pegs fall out of the vertical board. This is a serious game play issue because you cannot tell where you have fired or scanned. 2. The voice is VERY difficult to understand.  I cannot emphasize this enough...DO NOT buy the version in the blue box. It stinks. I was able to contact Hasbro (not an easy feat because their phone line is CONSTANTLY busy, you have to wait on hold for about ten minutes and their operators hung up on me twice [accidentally I hope] before I got to speak to them), and they sent me an entirely new unit in the green box. BUY the version in the green box; it is great (just don't use it in the elevated mode; keep it flat on the table) 
 I first got Phoenix on 8-track. Good thing , cause I really got some distance on it when I flung it out the car window.  I think Funk started to believe the critics. Anyways it was better then "Survival".  
 Anyone who writes about feminism as though there is only one kind of feminism is not only short-sighted, but extremely arrogant as to suppose one's thoughts were worth the killing of innocent trees, whose resources could have been better used for a written work that recognizes and distinguishes between the different types of feminist approaches.    All feminism is not the same.  Ms. Kassian failed to see that.  She also failed to acknowledge that not only are there many different feminist approaches in the white women's movement, but there are also African-American, Caribbean and Chicana women's movements, of which there is none of the garbage propagated by most of the white feminist movements (sorry to the white feminists out there).  A retitling of the book should be: "The Common Mistake: Not Distinguishing Feminist Approaches While Privileging White Feminism. 
 Hate to say it, but this is pretty drab stuff.  That said, I'm hardly about to complain; how could I?  This was obviously written for a film (that I have no interest in seeing), and Mogwai just released 'Mr. Beast', a solid (if unspectacular) album earlier this year.  I kind of see 'Zidane' as a gift, then.  Looking at the whole thing from that perspective, it's impossible to be letdown.   But then, retaining much emotion out of this composition is downright difficult.  Mogwai, when channeling the right energies, create sublime, beautiful music -- truly as beautiful as any form of modern music, to my ears.  When they're a bit more ambiguous, though, the results tend to float in limbo and lack direction.  'Zindane' seems to possess certain elements of both these characteristics to an extent, but the result is surprisingly dull -- at best, it's pretty; at worst, it's utterly monotonous.    The ideas are here, too; it's not that 'Zindane' lacks drive or intent.  It is a focused work. Yet,  it's obvious, I think, that the music, contrary to most film scores, desires to refrain from emotional manipulation.  While that's admirable, I find that musically, I'd much rather be manipulated than dazed; this is literally music to listen to whilst on painkillers.  There are a few nice themes and motifs, don't get me wrong, but this is ALL underscore -- Mogwai, in the best way possible, has a great gift at handling melodrama, and here they never appear to be guided by the dramatic light.   I won't sway anyone from attempting to get 'Zidane', but I wouldn't hand it out to anyone unexposed to Mogwai in some hopes of garnishing their admiration. No, for that, I would naturally lead them to one of their many fine studio albums.  For, Mogwai is a band, after all -- they are not Jerry Goldsmith or Ennio Morricone.  For those unaware, Mogwai performed much of the score for the recently released film 'The Fountain' -- though they did not write any of the actual material, from what I've gathered -- and as a musical experience, the soundtrack release for that album absolutely blows 'Zidane' out of the water.  In my opinion, it even beats out 'Mr. Beast', so impatient fans who need a fresh dose of Mogwai 'oughta check that one out for sure 
 I ordered this book based on the Title information. No where did they mention the word "Cram101 Textbook" in the title. It is only in the Editorial that they mention this. This is clearly false advertising by Amazon who I can only conclude are trying get rid of a surplus of these companion texts 
 This book is well written and starts with an excellent review of the context of Polish history after the World War 2 (Chapter 1). Unfortunately, following chapters go downhill from there, to end up with the incredibly biased conclusion. Shattering, factual crime descriptions (such as the description of the Kielce pogrom) are getting more and more intertwined with one sided testimonials, anecdotal evidence, author's opinions, as well as clear omissions of important facts, not to mention some misleading and untruthful statements.  No one can seriously question the existence of anti-semitism in Europe, but there was only one clearly genocidal anti-Semitism there, and it was not Polish but German. German? This word is hardly existent in the book. Why in this book there are only some unidentified "Nazis" and clearly identified Poles. According to the author, "many of them (Poles) joined the Nazi campaign of plunder and murder". This is a blatant untruth with no historical evidence whatsoever.   The author discards visible Jewish-Polish leading role in governing the after-war communist Poland. He only mentions Jewish-Polish involvement in the "UB" secret service, a murderous terror machine. Nothing is mentioned about the economy tsar Hilary Minc and many of his Jewish-Polish people. What about dozens of Jewish-Polish most prominent media figures who seemingly ruled the propaganda machine, the only one media expression allowed. For many Poles living under communist oppression, the overwhelming Jewish-Polish presence in the top government, terror apparatus, and media, the term "Zydokomuna" (Judeo-Communism) was an obvious observation.   I do not deny that terrible crimes were committed by Polish thugs or mobs against Jewish-Polish citizens. But it works both ways, and one may wonder how many Poles (including Jewish-Polish) vanished in torture chambers or otherwise in hands of Jewish-Polish part of the infamous "UB", the security service of the post-war Poland.   There are many testimonials and stories about Jewish-Polish citizens' prominent complicity in Russian crimes against Polish population after the Russian invasion in 1939. This book mentions horrific Lithuanian atrocities against Jews after the German invasion in 1941. Again, there are many testimonials and stories written by Lithuanian, Latvian or Estonian ï¿½migrï¿½s, who witnessed Russian takeover of their countries and massive liquidation of their best people, pointing out their Jewish origin citizens' massive complicity in Russian crimes.   This book's drastically subjective message is camouflaged by undisputable facts skillfully mixed with selected stories and opinions. Above all, Jan T. Gross blatantly uses so called "white lies" i.e. mortal sins of omission. It is inexcusable, intellectually fake, and morally wrong to present any publicly expressed discussions in 1945-1956 as facts. At that time Poland was ruled iron-hands-on by Russian "advisors" and their Polish as well as Jewish-Polish puppets, and media censorship was absolute. The press discussants were either communist puppets or "useful fools" allowed to write if and when the propaganda machine allowed for it.  This book is sad. The author cannot hide his seemingly virulent anti-Polonism, possibly triggered by his forced departure from Poland in 1968, as a result of the ruthless communist state elite power struggle, that unjustly labeled Poland as an anti-Semitic nation. The book is merely a one sided story called "truth". Such books trigger accusations of anti-Polonism and are matched by opposing one-sided stories or "truths", written often by representatives of academia. A great divide grows further and suits no one. This book, similarly to opposite ones, aims at preventing reconciliation between Poles and Jews. By forcefully and unjustly singling out Poles, it solidifies mutual distrust and hate, where they exist, and therefore is dead wrong. 
 Like many of the other reviewers, I found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  However, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.  What's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.    Interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  A good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great 
 With so many good books out there just waiting to be explored, why would anyone read Norman Mailer?  This book is a testament to the author's own arrogance, and we the reader are forced to suffer through all its self-indulgent twists and turns.  Don't read books by this neanderthal.  He's way past his prime.  Actually, he never was in his prime.  All of his books are equally dreadful.  So let's put Mailer's books in the trash bin where they belong.  Haven't we had enough of these writers who write and publish by hubris alone?  Go away Mailer, your time us up 
 My wife and I both got this phone at the same time.  I chose it because it claims to be rugged, and the price was right.  Well, we have had them for around six months, and they are both not working right.  My wife took hers to one of those stores in the mall that can change the case, so her i560 now wears pink.  Shortly after, it started resetting itself randomly.  She would pick it up, just to find that she needed to enter the SIM password.  Over time it started doing it more and more.  At first I believed that it might be due to damage done from the case change, but later my phone started doing the same thing.  Now, my phone will reset itself at least four or five times a day.  I absolutely cannot believe that such a product is even being sold with such a bad defect.  Anybody can ship one bad product, but to get two phones with the same problem is unforgivable.  Shame on Motorola 
 I am the mother of two elementary aged children who love art projects.  This was a Christmas gift and I was never so disappointed in the quality of this item.  It arrived with crayons broken and the ones that weren't, you couldn't even use on paper.  The markers are dry and caps don't stay on.  This is a terrible product and the price is ridiculous!!!  Definitely would be better off purchasing these items elsewhere!! 
 I've just returned this unit. It doesn't play videos as advertised.  I was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below. But 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture. At 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later.   I have now had 3 different brands of 8" photo frames in my possession: a Phillips, a Pandigital, and this Coby.  I have developed the following list of features in my "ideal" photo frame. First, video playback: I've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along, and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within/between chips and my computer is attractive. I would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking (.mov, more later) I'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is, to play movie clips in show presentations, intermixed with .jpg photo files.  Second feature is to play .wma music files, in addition to MP3. This is because I have a non-Ipod personal music player. All my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of MP3. Third, I would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning, off at night, for example. Fourth, I'd like an audio or speaker out feature. None of these frames has home theater-like sound, and I have an extra pair of computer speakers I'd probably hook up. Video out could come in handy too. Fifth, I'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame's software, manually or automatically. Yes, you can rotate them in the computer, but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation. (This may depend on which photo edit program you are using.) Sixth, I'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame's software. Especially with the huge chips now available, I see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set (folder), rather than switching out chips.  Here is where the 3 units I've had stack up, followed by my next (fourth) unit.   I am keeping the Pandigital....which Costco has for $140. It plays .mov video files, but not within a slideshow. It has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny. It requires MP3 music files. It permits picture rotation.  No folder management system. No clock/timer. No ability to play stills/video intermixed. I think the Coby and Phillips picture quality is brighter but the Pandigital is ok.  The phillips didn't play video, and since it also had a software glitch when I returned it I decided to look elsewhere. (no remote and no music with the philips either.)  The Coby won't play my videos, even after I used my converter program to try about 10 different MP4 and AVI variations. The Coby plays .wma music files, won't rotate stills, has no folder system, no clock/timer. It has a speaker out jack. It does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show. Picture quality is fully equal to Philips, generally the recognized standard. If all you want is photos, and never turn your camera sideways, this unit will be a good value.  Another unit I'd like to get to play with would be the Image Moments model by Digitalfoci. I've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and I believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos.  
    Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are acttually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I heard a rumor that Martin Atkins is broke and can't pay his half of a mortgage.  Doesn't surprise me if this is what Underground is all about lately.  This album will go back to the store where it came from and I will trade it in for some good music. 
 The good 1. This book has a coding style that is very reminiscient of some code one might find in UNIX books(perl, etc).  If you are transitioning, this might be a help.  I am not sure.  I am not a big Unix programmer. 2. Many things are discussed in this book that are not discussed in other texts.  This book has a good focus on console code which is nice for a beginner.  Windows programming is not hard but like motif or tk, a solid understanding of the basics is good before delving into heavy UI programming.    The bad  1. The code examples are extremely buggy and littered with potential buffer overflows and other mistakes which often make this seem like a guide on how not to program(especially in our security conscious society). 2. The code examples are often efficient but rarely self-documenting.  Efficieny is usually best gained by better algorithms and gaining efficiency by tricks which make code harder to read should be left to after profiling the code and finding the bottlenecks.  Furthermore, things like synchronous I/O are the focus of these over optimizations (especially for a beginners book).  I/O programs are rarely CPU dependent and rarely gain benefits from brute force logical optimizations.  This is not the Zen of Assembly language and TINSTAFC (There Is no such thing as the fastest code) are not necessary here.  Books like Writing Solid Code by Steve McConnel should be required reading for any programmer.  Both 1 and 2 do get better as the book progresses but be aware that the code is designed in ways that make buffer overflows likely.  3. This book should not be called Windows System Programming.  The title is misleading and you will not find in depth kernel programming here.  Microsoft Windows Internals is much much better here(though it is by no means an introductory book).  System programming is often taken to mean internals programming. 4. Most windows programs do not look like the code here.  Unfortunately, console programming is vastly different from programming using the standard Windows interface.  It is different on unix toolkits like XWindows or TK too.  I am not sure just focusing on console development is where a beginner should go.  I am still reading and will probably update my comments later but so far this is what I see 
 I found this book dissappointing. It overstates the obvious. Unless you are totally clueless and never had to pick up your room as a kid, you probably know all this stuff already. A waste of money 
 Professor Jenkins has written with insight and clarity on a number of controversial topics, unfortunately, while this book raises some important points, it is rather tendentious compared to his past works. At one point, he claims that the Clinton Administration's Health Security Initiative failed to make it into law because of the Administration's petty aversion to having the Catholic Church as an ally. This strange assertion will come as news to many, including Theda Skocpol, author of the most comprehensive study on the failure of the Clinton health care proposal. Elsewhere, Professor Jenkins explores the pedigree of anti-Catholic prejudice in America in depth, but he fails to do the same for Vatican hostility to the United States which has a long pedigree of its own. Despite the good feelings towards the Catholic Church in the United States at independence (due in part to French aid against the British) and the disestablishment of Protestant churches, the Vatican regarded the U.S. "as the bastard brat of Jacobinism" (to quote Samuel Eliot Morison) and warned against the heresy of "Americanism". This hostility persisted right up until the papacy of John XXIII. Also, during the 19th century, the Vatican made no bones about its opposition to freedom of religion, freedom of thought, and freedom of conscience. This hostility persisted right up until the Second Vatican Council. Unfortunately, while none of the Vatican II reforms have been formally rescinded during the papacy of John Paul II, they now seem to be as much a dead letter as the splendid list of rights embalmed in the old Soviet constitution.   Nevertheless, it is deplorable that Roman Catholics have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in actions this book indisputably documents. Such treatment deserves condemnation wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others that endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. But the proper reaction to outrages committed against Catholics should not be to claim that all who take a critical view of the church are motivated by prejudice. There is an immense and inordinate effort by the Vatican in some countries (e.g., Poland, Italy, the United States) to manipulate civil-statutes and to have its doctrines written into the secular law. Even when the Vatican's efforts may seriously threaten the lives and well being of a large number of people, (as in attempts to hamstring public health efforts against sexually transmitted disease) its advocates remain undeterred and refuse to consider the magnitude of the risks involved. Although the authoritarian inclination of the Church is not a crime, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered towards clericalism; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective threat to a democratic polity. When the Church seeks to illegitimately extend its power in democratic societies, or when civil legislation is introduced to confer privileges to which no one denomination has any conceivable right, neither the Vatican nor Professor Jenkins should be surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground, and irrational and violent reactions increase. Therefore special concern and attention should be directed toward those who have this inclination, lest they be led to believe that the subversion of the U.S. Constitution is a morally acceptable option. It is not.   With all this in mind, decent Catholics should ask their Bishops to be especially cautious of any programs that may seek to pressure American law and society to abrogate the rights of any citizens, even while claiming not to do so. A careful examination of the public statements and the activities conservative Catholic pressure groups promote reveals a blatant duplicity by which they attempt to mislead Catholics and the general public alike. For example, they may present the teaching of the Magisterium as if it were the mandatory source for all secular laws. Its specific authority is held to be binding on the entire society. Some of these groups will use the word "democratic" to describe either the organization or its intended actions, yet they do not defend and promote the interests of American society; indeed, they even openly attack it. Those within the Church who argue in this fashion often have close ties with those with similar views outside it. These latter groups are guided by a vision bitterly opposed to American liberty and pluralism. They reflect, even if not entirely consciously, a 'sacral state' ideology that denies the democratic nature of the United States, as well as the rights of every individual. This does not mean that conservative Catholics are not generous and giving of themselves on occasion, but when they engage in seditious activity against fellow citizens, they confirm within themselves a disordered political inclination that is essentially self-indulgent.   Jesus promised, "You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free" (Jn. 8:32). Conservative Catholics (including the hierarchy here and in the Vatican) should have the truth about American society and its secular democratic culture clearly explained to them so they will stop denigrating it so incessantly. After all, without the defeat of Nazism and U.S. opposition to Soviet communism, the young Karol Wojtyla might well have been shot in a secret police cellar instead of going on to become pontiff. There has never been a society in human history that afforded so many--Catholics included--the opportunity to practice their religion so freely as the United States. However, Catholics must be trustworthy custodians of other's freedoms as well as their own. Perhaps Professor Jenkins's next book can take up this challenge 
 I wanted to like this book but was very disappointed that all it included was a mish mash of Vanity Fair articles from 1990-2002 with follow up paragraphs that appear to be right out of People magazine 
 I ordered this book and began to study the diagrams and directions.  I soon found that the diagrams and the directions are not the same.The diagram will show a piece cut at 14 inches the directions say cut the same piece at 14 3/4 etc... these kinds of inconsistancies are numerous in every project and if you study the pictures it is clear that the person who built these lamps did not follow his own directions.  This book was very poorly put together. I have bought many books with project plans and have never bought one with as many mistakes throughout the whole book 
   Although I found the gay-bashing theme at first compelling and sympathetic, as I got further into the story the plot took off at the expense of further character development. Clare as a priest who is the pastor of a church faded into the background, getting only superficial attention.    By the end I was exhausted, trying to keep up with the galloping plot. Two irritable details about the Chief, Russ, had me saying out loud to the author, "Please don't mention Russ adjusting his glasses again, and please don't have him saying for the upteenth time, "Excuse my French."    A good idea for a plot, but more character development and slower pacing would help a lot 
 I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't.  This book is mediocre at best.  I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did.  I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim.  I doubt I will ever meet a "Wim" in real life!).  My favorite Danielle Steel novels are "The Gift" and "Safe Harbour".  I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories.  If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try 
 Once again, Hollywood runs out of ideas and remakes a movie that doesn't need to be remade.  Even with more colorful characters, there really is no need for this!  Save yourself time and watch the original 
 I just finished reading this book and personally I did not like it, I thought his last book was better.  I also just finished reading "Schmucks" by Jackie Mason & Raoul Felder definitely a great book hits the mark.  Goldberg just doesn't hit the mark in this book.  If you are a looking for a really funny, conservative on the mark book buy "Schmucks 
 that Hip-hop was a single, rather than LP(now CD) driven genre, and that most hip-hop CD's, have 1,2 0r if your lucky 3 great tunes on it, with the rest being fillers. Case in point, this CD.I would say that only 'It's gets no rougher' and 'Why do ya think they call it dope?'cut it, with the rest being fillers. If I remember righty at the time, this LP markeda time when many people thought that LL had fallen off, with his boasting rhymes, in a time of Public enemy, KRS One 'Knowledge of self' era. I would check out on itunes, and buy tunes that appeal. 
 I believe that life is too short and books that really deserve to be read too plentiful (not to mention movies worth watching, games worth playing, ...) for anyone to spend more than five minutes on this book. It's amazing how marketing can help sell such fluffy material. Any time, I recommend "If You Want to Write" by Brenda Ueland instead 
 I do not find this CD funny in the least bit. The song "Because I Got High" has got to be the dumbest thing ever written, with one of the most boring beats and repetitive lyrics that I have ever heard. Also, there are other dumb songs like "She won't let me". He tries so hard to be funny to the teenage crowd, and in some ways he succeeds, but to most people, I think that he will just be another annoying comedy rapper that us music listeners dont need to hear 
 Reading about statistics in this manner- the language, crammed text, etc. is a surefire narcotic, if that's what you want. It's heavy on quantitative research and methods- and tries a little too hard to pack it all in. You might use it as a reference but realize that you will probably get a headache from reading more that 5 pages in a sitting 
 I have eagerly purchased every Lois McMaster Bujold book that has been published in recent years, usually in hardcover as soon as it was released, and I did the same with this one.  I was horribly disappointed.  The plot is hazy.  The characters are not nearly as well drawn as her others.  The overall theme - younger woman, older man, clash of cultures - rehashes "Shards of Honor" but much less compellingly.  The distinctive and lovely use of language so characteristic of her earlier novels is missing here.  She resorts to telling rather than showing on nearly every page.  Finally, as other reviewers have commented, the novel leaves you hanging with an utterly incomplete story - a cheap marketing trick the author should have resisted!  Unlike every one of her previous books, with this one I had trouble getting into it and trouble staying with it and kept asking myself, Why am I wasting time with this? Will I buy the sequel?  Maybe, but not in hardback.  I'll wait for the paperback and read the reviews with care.  Even for her fans,  I can't recommend shelling out for the hardcover version.  For those new to her work, read something else of hers. Finally, why 2 stars instead of 1?  I didn't utterly give up reading the book in disgust.  That's the only reason 
 As a parent of 3 boys who love Star Wars, we are constantly purchasing books.  We have always purchased them at Borders (or stores of the like).  This was the first time I purchased a book on-line thru Amazon.  Within ONE MONTH the binding came unglued.  This has never occured with any of the other Star Wars books we've purchased.  My boys are very protective of their books and take care of them.  We now have a book with the hard-cover off and I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED and due to this do not plan on purchasing online thru Amazon if this is the quality I am to expect in the future 
 I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him.  This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.  Just on a side note, "The Bad Place" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining. 
 The movie "Extreme Ops" which opened to lukewarm reviews and even more lukewarm box office really should carry a government health warning with it. It is so mind numbingly incoherent and lackluster that one can feel your brain cells being depleted one by one after each comic strip moment.  Let me take that back because to equate comic strips with this piece of drivel is a disservice to comic strips. This movie has no plot and no characterization. The point appears to be to display some "amazing" stunt work but the effect is spoiled by an over usage of truly obvious computer generated effect work that would not look out of place on your home play station.  The plot, and I use the term loosely, concerns a group of commercial filmmakers who travel the world in attempts to catch stunts on film. They have been hired by a Japanese businessman to catch shots of a skier racing ahead of an avalanche (the reason why is never really given) so this ragtag group heads for Austria. Why they made the decision to film the shot in the Alps instead of the perfectly good Rocky Mountains is similarly never explained, except that it allows them to come into contact with a sneering Serbian war criminal fresh from faking his own death.  Understandably the sneering villain is none to happy to be sharing his mountain hideaway with an obnoxious group of teenagers. He, like the theater audience, seems to find them just as annoying as we do, but whereas we have the liberty of tuning them out or, even more sensibly, walking out in the middle of the movie, he takes a more homicidal approach and decides to do away with them.  I usually try to find some good points in a movie I review so it is somewhat balanced, however it is hard with this flick to find something positive to say, I guess one could point out that the girls are good looking and the scenery is equally pretty - does that count?  Do yourself a favor and give this a miss. I would also recommend that you pass it by when you see it on DVD shelves. There is absolutely no redeeming feature to this dull, dumb movie 
 While this book put together by the Detroit Free Press has action photos, they are some of the most disappointing pictures i've ever seen in a book about a team's season. Where are the photos of Tiger players actually hitting a baseball? If you want to see photos of players celebrating and covered in champagne, talking to fans and media and blowing bubbles, then this is the book for you but if you want to see some actual fine baseball action shots from the diamond itself, be prepared to be frustrated. I much preferred the photograhy in the George Cantor paperback "Out of Nowhere" The Detroit Tigers' Magical 2006 Season. I know that this volume covers the Play-offs and World Series whereas the Cantor book doesn't, but it's photo collection is poor, the photos in the Cantor book are superb. If you are a Tiger fan you may enjoy this book very much, (the writing and articles are quite good at least)but my enjoyment was spoilt somewhat by hardly any pictures of Tiger players hitting baseballs or fielding grounders etc. Very disappointing, worth only 2 stars 
 Okay. The premise of this movie had wings. I mean here we have a crazed asylum patient trapped in a spooky hospital for eternity trying to get out.  Fun stuff..right. Not in the hands of this director. I mean, when the only good scare devices you can offer up are an exploding clown and a dog thats had it's day, your in trouble, Mr. Director. Okay..lets try to right some wrongs done by this movie.  Right- Scary Hospital  Wrong- Un Scary plot devices  Right- Dead people making twitching movements Wrong- Exploding Clowns and rushes of violent air ala Evil Dead-       but much worse  Right- My complete and utter hate for the jock in the movie Wrong- My complete and utter hate for all of the actors in this         movie- I mean, come on who in the hell was this Shaft         wannabe and why didn't that dead dog rip a whole in his         cranium before we had to sit through all of his inane        epileptic dialogue.  Right- Use of confined spaces, like an elevator to heighten the         spooky.  Wrong- Too much use of going up the elevator and down the           elevator. I mean if there is such a thing as elevator           sickness, I had it.  Right- The film makers hearts were in the right place with an         attempt to do something a little different.  Wrong- Hey Bubs, listen. This day and age of horror..a little        different is like shooting yourself in the foot.         We horror fans expect more now days..even from grade B        movies.  Wrong- This was obviously a lame attempt to run with the big          dogs aka: Session 9.  Right- Okay everybody makes a big deal about them creeping          past that ghost. They say.."Oh what an intelligent        thing  to do." What? How the helk is that intelligent?          That ghost could have ghost rabies or something!  Okay, I digress. See this film only if you would like to see a rubber clown explode and a dog with no skin. Other than that, don't say I didn't warn ya 
 The ghost writer was probably afraid to put his own name on the book.  It was totally predictable without any of the depth found in real Ludlum books 
 I read this book in the hopes of gaining a helpful framework for thinking about - and perhaps even achieving - my "number" for retirement, but that is not what I found between its covers.  Mostly the book concerns itself with the soul - searching and anguish that people who have 1 - 10 million dollar "nest eggs" go through in trying to decide if its enough to support them in the manner to which they have become accustomed, until such time as they pass on.  Although I really FEEL for these people, my financial situation is much more in sync with the run-of-the-mill American, and for us Mr. Eisenberg has barely a mention, let alone advice. On a positive note, I did find his writing style to be very engaging. Bottom line - I would have to recommend that you avoid this book and use the time saved to read something more useful and/or fun 
 Keegan started out years ago with a bang with The Face of Battle, in which the post-Vietnam and, for the UK, a post-Empire spirit made for a genuinely innovative military history.  This early promise has NOT been fulfilled, and Keegan has declined considerably in quality because he's become co-opted by the Establishment, a post-Empire, Blair establishment every bit as corrupt as Haig.  Keegan has never served in combat yet loftily recommended in the 1980s that the "tempo" of the next war (which as a Sandhurst insider he was probably planning) be increased to 24/7. In this, he gave NO consideration to the high levels of post-traumatic stress and the war crimes that have resulted from the US policy of "no sleep until Baghdad" in the second Iraq war.  Keegan is post-Sixties, all right, but instead of peace and love, he's a Nietzchean who'd wage war with the poor man's body.  His "war" is chateau generalship by the rich, actually fought, 24/7, by British working class lads, blackfellows from Britain's few remaining colonies, and of course Americans.  Keegan popularized and made respectable for a new generation the old lie, subtly and over time, dulce et decorum. Precisely by foregrounding war's utter brutality he made it somehow acceptable and ONCE AGAIN a test of manhood, and this has gotten people killed.  His book on Military Intelligence managed, idiotically, to dismiss MI as secondary and not critical precisely, almost to the day, when the American and British MI was declaring victory (remember Mission Accomplished?) and failing to see how disbanding the Iraqi army would create the insurgency.  The Iraq War recounts the war as a board game with neither any anticipation of the postwar mess nor any compassion whatsoever for the men and women who fought it, or the Iraqis brutalized. At key points, it expresses a puzzlement about the failure of Iraqis to greet their "liberators" which shows a willful incomprehension of anything outside military science.  Ignore all writings by John Keegan until he issues a public apology for the lives this twit has destroyed while sipping pink gin at Sandhurst. For a good history of the Iraq War cf. Thomas E. Ricks, THE IRAQ WAR 
 In the preamble to readers, Miss Malkin bangs on about how her essay defends the relocation and internment of ethnic Japanese and enemy aliens during World War II, rattling on to write "her work is by no means all-encompassing; my aim is to provoke a debate on a sacrosanct subject that has remained undebatable for far too long."  Further on, however, in her own words, she says it's about "correcting the record," which doesn't quite jibe with "provoke a debate."  Nope.  This work plays out as a revisionist view of how the U.S. government interred over 100,000 aliens and U.S. citizens of Japanese descent, based not on hysteria, paranoia or racism, but on intelligence gained from classified Japanese originated telexes sent to its ministries around the world, before being forwarded to US-based (Japanese to a person) spies of the Japanese government.  She bases this statement on indepth research conducted through (but not limited to) original documents from the FBI, Justice Department, Office of Naval Intelligence, numerous offices within the War Department, State Department, Military Intelligence Division, President Roosevelt's own communications and the aforementioned telexes.  And, she accomplished all this within twelve months - the same twelve months she continued to hack out an ongoing newspaper column and bask in the glories of childbirth.  I doubt it.  To get this issue right - if that's even possible - she'd have to trawl through a lifetime of documentation, interview witnesses, survivors, etc, with which to form her hypothesis.  Not the Michelle Malkin I'm familiar with.  A day spent on Google perhaps.  FOXNews transcripts, maybe.  Nope, there's something dodgy, if not outright incredible about this 'work. 
 Rice tries to pull all the lose ends together in the third book of her Beauty Trilogy but she honestly seems out of steam and spankings. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they have read the other two books in the trilogy. Beauty and Tristan are kidnapped by a Sultan and his court, but the sexual games remain much the same with spanking as the primary focus of obedience and submission. The sex scenes remain repetitive and thus border on boring. Even after three books, Beauty remains very one dimensional, almost mentally retarded. There really is no plot, only situations for sexual encounters. The ending, where Beauty and Tristan are finally joined as husband and wife, King and Queen, is extremely weak and contrived. This series is the weakest product produced by Anne Rice. She should have trusted her characters to have some internal growth and change, some intelligence.  
 I've read every one of Iris Johansen's "suspense" novels and have loved most of them.  The last couple though have been so painful to get through. This one however, I don't think I can even finish.  I read where someone called these characters "cardboard," and I couldn't agree more.  The female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist.  Whereas in the Eve Duncan Books and the Wind Dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters, it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class.  "Now this should happen here, and this here, and this here and boom, climax, happily every after."    I hope that Iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time.  
 I am utterly disappointed in the results of my Psych GRE scores even after i INTENSELY studied the Kaplan GRE Psych book, highlighted, took notes, and memorized the relevant info. that i thought would help me for the exam.  While Kaplan did a superb job reviewing my psych knowledge and giving me a better and broader understanding of the branches of intro psych., it completely FAILED in preparing me for the ACTUAL GRE exam.  The exam (which was about 2 months ago), did not cover ANTHING that I studied in the Kaplan book.  Names, concepts, detailed questions... I was not prepared for any of the material, even though I repeatedly scored 800s on the practice test in the KAPLAN book.  Anyways, just a heads up if you're considering buying or NOT buying this book 
   Well, I don't if I would trust anything written by this author. He was recently arrested after admitting to sexually molesting some of the young boys who were his patients.    Here is a quote from NBC5 television, "CHICAGO -- A psychiatrist in the north suburb of Long Grove, Ill., was arrested this week for the sexual assault of two boys. The suspect, Gary Almy, 61, touts himself as a "biblical councilor." Police said Almy admitted that he fondled two boys at a residential teen treatment center. Almy, who once headed a veteran's hospital, is being held in a Lake County jail on $600,000 bond" 
  It was Mark Twain who popularized the aphorism of Benjamin Disraeli that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.  I kept hearing all these marvelous things about FREAKONOMICS, a book by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, so when I ran across it at 25% off, I did a stupid freakin' thing and bought it.  I thought, What the freak, I've got a pretty inquisitive mind and I'm open to seeing things differently, to discovering new viewpoints.  The doubt started early when I got the book home and I first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of Time, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Los Angeles Times.  When all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is, I'm immediately going to be freakin' suspicious.  Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us on the cover, "Prepare to be dazzled."  Well, evidently Ol' Malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than I am.  (I won't even mention the smug mug of Stephen Dubner that taunted me from the book's dust jacket because I don't want you to get the idea that I judge a book by its cover.  Or in this case, a writer by his physiognomy.  So I won't mention that.)  If you're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70% of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver's home, then you just MIGHT be dazzled by FREAKONOMICS.  If I tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts, thinking that it is cutting costs, is probably increasing its overhead, and this fact astounds you  - if you must ask "But how?" - then yes, buy FREAKONOMICS and be dazzled.  Mostly what FREAKONOMICS offers (when its conclusions can be trusted) is just what we used to call "common sense."  But since America has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent, brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of SURVIVORS, and AMERICAN IDOLS, and LOST knuckleheads, good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead (when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands, that is).  I dove into FREAKONOMICS hoping to find my purchase worthwhile.  I got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized: everything would require second-guessing and verifying.  On that page, Smug Mug tells us (based on a single report by the Institute Of Medicine) that "drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health."  Fortunately, I read YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER by Doctor F. Batmanghelidj over a decade ago so I already knew what a bunch of bunk that was.  In chapter 4, Smug Mug "proves" that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate.  This represents the centerpiece of his book, both literally and ideologically.  The first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early 1990s.  On page 92, the author acknowledges that the police in Atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early `90s in hopes of landing the 1996 Olympics.  Well, would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the `90s as predicted?  True, being honest might be means to an increased budget, but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control.  And surely the Chamber Of Commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception.  Let me ask, do YOU actually feel you're less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early 1990s?  That's funny, me neither.  There's so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported, and recently, an ex-police officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were able to do in the `80s and `90s because crime is so out-of-control now.  In dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime (if this claim is a verity), Dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10% of the drop.  Having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian, it's funny that I find myself even contending with the stats Smug Mug uses that actually WORK AGAINST his theory: I believe the wide-scale hiring of police officers since the early `90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - less than the 10% - while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly.  And Dubner concludes that right-to-carry firearm laws "simply don't bring down crime."  (Be sure to read the utterly fascinating book, GUNFIGHTERS, HIGHWAYMEN & VIGILANTES by Roger D. McGrath, for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint!)  In dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion, I didn't notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early `90s, and I wonder if that might have some statistical bearing.  Ya think?   Yes, I think Smug Mug is selective.  He calls some abortions a "crude and drastic sort of insurance policy."  Not "immoral."  Not "sinful."  But then I didn't expect Smug Mug to call a sin a sin.    And even if Levitt and Dubner's hypothesis is correct, that abortions have lowered crime, the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person, but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered.  So why are we even discussing this?  I'll tell you why: because the pro-choice folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus, and now they're pulling out all the stops, trying to "statistically" convince the masses that they're safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing.  I find this repulsive!  (And there are studies indicating that those missing people have, and will continue to have, a negative economic impact on society.)  I won't even go into chapter 5, What Makes A Perfect Parent?  Suffice to say that as usual (surprise! surprise!) all the statistics Dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue.  Funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs.  Just know that if you're a working mother, you haven't cheated your child in the least, but if you're a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order, you are "unenlightened."  If your kid is watching lots of TV, it isn't turning the "child's brain to mush."  (No word on whether or not it's turning his/her morals to mush though.)  And the studies (that we are called to pay attention to) show "that a child's character wasn't much affected whether or not he was sent to day care, whether he had one parent or two, whether his mother worked or didn't, whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each."  (I've often wondered what might have happened to me if my Mom, who was home most of the time, hadn't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day, year after year, while I was growing up in the `60s and `70s.)  I've given FREAKONOMICS two stars because I did find the section on the naming of children very interesting, as well as the story of Stetson Kennedy's fight against the "three Ks."  But if you're smarter than I am, you'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it.  Economically speaking, that's just "common cents." 
 Pull the string of this brightly colored fish, and . . .that's about all the fun you're going to have.  The fish is supposed to speed across the water, but it just sits in one spot vibrating.  My daughter and I were very  disappointed 
 I actually returned this book it was so bad.  The selection criteria seemed reasonable, but they don't match the premise: supposedly a book about self-employed millionaire business women, the anecdotes are all about those who have made their money by saving while working in typical to low-paying jobs -- hardly any insight into the personalities of women who have managed to succeed in spite of cultural attitudes that steer them to lower earning careers. Clipping grocery coupons and setting goals get equal mention in this "analysis".   Then the writing and organization is simply sloppy:  women are divided into alpha and beta types that are never defined.  One chapter was about someone named Brian -- I thought maybe this was a new androgenous nickname, but the pronoun was "he" -- so what is this doing in a book about women?  Maybe this improved -- I wouldn't know, I gave up in disgust.      
 this book makes a point and drives it home over and over (and over) again.  While it was a stunning revelation that restricted communities were actually the norm during the first half of the 20th century, rather than the exception, the author pounded it home without speaking about the repercussions of such covenants: Inner cities destroyed, ghettoization, crime, and life in the burbs turned out to be a dubious gift, at best.  America is now plagued with obesity, depression, pollution, and all around stupidity, because of moving people so far apart from each other and the services they need to live.   This author could have well spent more time looking at the bigger picture, rather than beating us with one fact 
 This is my first book by this author, and I honestly feel like I might like the story after-the-fact, if the author didn't ruin all the punchlines in the book. The fact that he felt the need to explain away every twist in the plot made me feel like I was being beat over the head with a "Did you get it?" stick. I also thought he was over-doing the fairytale theme, with the swirly chapter pages and obligatory detail that had zero quirks 
 As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.  
 Anyone who rates this more than one star has mental deficiencies.  Seriously 
 Neoliberalism was born on September 11, 1973, when a US-backed military coup murdered the democratically elected President of Chile and ushered in the tyranny of General Pinochet who murdered and tortured thousands, closed parliament, and outlawed political parties and trade unions.  If that doesn't give you pause about the compatibility of neoliberalism and democracy, read this book.    In Hayek's model of an ideal constitution each citizen is given one vote per lifetime when they reach the age of 45 (page 113).  Then, Hayek decides that's probably too generous, and calls for an "indirect method of election" where the legislature would appoint regional delegates who would appoint new legislators, without any popular vote at all (page 114).    Neoliberals hate democracy, in both theory and practice, and are much more comfortable with an oligarchy 
 I'm terribly disappointed. The feed chute is tiny (barely big enough for two fingers), the tray above the chute doesn't hold anything (most things fall out), clean-up is a nightmare, and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice.  Stick with a centrifugal juicer like the Breville Elite 800, unless you enjoy torturing yourself 
 This is truly one the most spectacular films ever made, not suffering for having been made during the silent era. However, as correctly stated by another review of the film, the DVD version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the VHS 155mins. This is not due to DVD faster frame rate, but rather because the DVD version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason. At one point, the Hero (Fairbanks) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree, the next minute he is seen explaining to her (in an intimate scene) that he is not what he seems. Having seen the VHS a number of times, I can confirm that the DVD version has been brutally cut. Do not buy the DVD version, as it is a let-down with those scenes missing; thus the reason for my one star, which would otherwise have been 4 1/5 (5 stars with the Rimsky Korsakov soundtrack). You have been warned 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 Has a horrible "show don't tell problem", pacing problems, clichs are handled poorly and characters are rather two dimensional 
 I have waited almost two months and the book still hasnt been shipped. I am still waiting for it to arrive. I hope this book is worth waiting for... 
 I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years, but I stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago, because after awhile, it seemed as if all of his characters were the same. I recently read the back cover of this book, and it sounded so interesting, so I gave it a chance. Boy, was I sorry. It is as if Dean Koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student! His sentences are awkward, mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can - it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side. This was way too distracting, and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale.  Please Dean, take an opportunity to read some 'how-to' books on writing 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 Personally, I don't like this book.  It reads like a big dictionary... lots of words but nothing tying things together.  I found it difficult to find and follow a set of concrete steps to help get a PMO up and running.  I understand it is "complete" but it does it at the expense of the "shotgun effect"--throwing a lot of stuff out but not really zeroing in on anything.  I think this book would be great for someone who needed to pick and choose a few specific things and wanted a reference but as a day-to-day book to help with setting up a PMO and figuring out how to get a PMO effort off the ground in a way that ensures success, it misses the mark unfortunately 
 I will never ever recommend this author. She may claim to be a Christian, but her behavior is anything but. This person has no business counseling parents of homosexuals, as it is clear she has no understanding of them. She describes them as something that formed wrong, flowers that didn't open. I have news for you, Ms. Johnson. God doesn't make mistakes. Each person is made that way for a reason, just because you can't get out of a stone age interpretation of the Bible, don't infect other parents and friends of gay people with your poisonous fake christian "love". I want to go wash my hands in lysol. It is because of attitudes like hers that Christians like me are portrayed as a bunch of whacko nutjobs 
 I'll preface this by saying I'm a cryer.  I cry at movie previews when they simply look entertaining.  I cried all the way through Superman Returns.  I did not, however, shed one tear during Message in a Bottle.  In English class, I always learned to "show, not tell" when writing.  When that is your rule of thumb, you'll write a moving piece of literature, even if you're not completely skillful.  Sparks is the master of telling without showing.  I'm honestly baffled by all the good reviews it gets.  The story is somewhat engaging, but with no payoff.  But the work is filled with passages like (and these are from memory; if I picked up the book to look for verbatim examples I'd have to type the entire thing), "He went to the refrigerator, opened the door, and took a beer.  After opening it, he sat down on the back deck."  Or, "Though she was overweight, she moved quickly around the table."  "She got out of the shower, dried off, and put on khaki shorts and a white cotton shirt."  Have you read enough yet?  I'm new to the romance genre.  My mother-in-law recommended Sparks because -- I think she was trying to imply -- his sex scenes aren't too graphic.  They were to me, but then, I'm new to romance, and spoiled by the masterful, unequaled storytelling skill of Stephen King.  Please hold your New York Times bestsellers to a higher standard.  Let's hold on to whatever quality control we can in music, movies, and literature 
 This is a work that pretends at objectivity, but is written with a clear agenda in mind. Pappe totally identifies with the Palestian  Arab cause, and places the major onus for the conflict on the Jews of Israel. Thus he slants the major historical and political realities, in which the Jews have five times agreed to a peace plan based on partition while the Arabs have insistently refused to accept the Jews right to a state of their own. Pappe underplays the persistent and systematic Arab violence and terror which have been at the heart of the conflict from its beginning. He mistells the story of the 1947-1948 war minimizing the Arab agression, the calls of the leaders of Arab states for Palestinians to temporarily abandon their homes , so that invading Arab armies would be able to kill Jews more freely. He underplays the countless initiatives made by Israelis from all walks of life to live in peaceful relations with the Arabs. And does not really put the conflict into the  context of the pan- Arabic, Islamic fundamentalist, and Arab nationalist processes which perpetuate the conflict even today.  This is Revisionist History at its worst, a distorting and ignoring of the factual and objective reality in order to promote a ' cause' . That cause is disguised and misrepresented in the work.  For Pappe as anyone who reads carefully will see  is calling for a Jewish state which ceases to be Jewish in any meaningful way, and eventually becomes an Arab dominated one , in which its Arab minority will eventually become its majority. Pappe's analysis is one which aims to help bring about the destruction of Israel. Is it surprising then that most Israelis consider him to be both a hypocrite and a traitor?  
 they showed this book as being the right book, but when i received it, it was a friggen STUDY GUIDE. total baloney 
 I support the other comment made by a poster: Editor, where were you when this book was written? The writing is so terrible. Maybe .37 is too much for this book actually 
 This is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book. This book, in my opinion, is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders. A complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance. Take time researching this book before you buy it because it's the worst book I've ever purchased. 
 They have no label on the top (hard tell which side is up). These are the worst DVDRs i have ever seen and used. The Speed is much slower than other brand DVDR such as Ridata.( although they are both 4X). 3 of 4 DVDRs got errors during burning. But Other brand DVDRs are 100% OK.  I am going to return these package to Amazon.  
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 All the Pretty Horses In the first few moments you know how the film will go wrong.  Voice offer-which is often misused in movies based on books as a way to capture some of the original author's voice-is especially damning here.  We hear the miscast Matt Damon offering Cole's commentary on what has happened where he lives, what is wrong with it, and thus, why he must go.  The problem is, that commentary doesn't exist in the novel.  In fact, we never get inside a character's head except through witnessing acts and listening to dialogue-and this is true of all of McCarthy's work.  He writes, in essence, beautiful screenplays.  Stories that are told in carefully controlled images and well honed and realistic dialogue.  Director Thorton and screenwriting Tally make the huge mistake of trying to give this film a "literary" feel.  Most certainly they were overwhelmed by the beauty and the poetry of the descriptions of place and action offered in the novel, and I suppose some of the choices they've made were out of a kind of panic.  Damon, who is too old and earnest in the wrong ways for the part, may have been likewise intimidated by the source material and decided to make the character his own as opposed to McCarthy's.  The Grady of the novel is not one who is just pure and straightforward; rather, he is a character at odds with the darker ways of the world, for it can be navigated only through careful use of reason and he is a character who doesn't just choose to remain more true to his feelings, but who can hardly help it, a character emblematic of a stubborn type of innocence that carries with it an infectious aura of danger-we see it and its consequences later on in the third book of the trilogy, Cities on the Plain.  To create a work film which doesn't understand and showcase this trait is to do not even the minimal of justice to its source.   A good film can be made of McCarthy's work; it will take boldness and a screenwriter and a director who realize that the poetry of the prose can only be approximated-perhaps paralleled-in the poetry of the cinematography, and that, beyond that, the plots and what they represent, and the efficiency of the dialogue, is enough.  Maybe even more than enough.  
 Like the looks of the watch.  However, it's very noisy and the clasp tends to come apart after removing the watch.  The face can also be difficult to read in bright light (reflection) 
 I was very dissapointed with my purchase, as the citrus taste of the water was absolutely terrible and I just could not drink it, so there's a whole case sitting unused on my porch.  Waste of money 
 I picked up Thanksgiving hoping for a cute fun read for the holidays. Instead I found the plot of this novel rather thin and the humor a bit 'meh.' From the moment where the rabbit was eating our heroine's costume to the scene where the single teen mom drops her baby off with Dr. Pat, I just found it a little too silly. Too implausible even for Evanovich.   I guess I'm a bit bored of the sterotypical 'single people who cannot cook...' humor. Been there read that. Also the cutsey baby humor and the way the heroine oozes over the baby made me roll my eyes. If I'd known this was one of those baby books I'd never have picked it up.   I gave up halfway through when the heroine and the doctor conspire to keep the baby for the holidays... I just found I could not maintain any interest.  2 stars 
 I have watched a lot of horror movies in my lifetime.  There are some great and original films in this genre, and there are some that are just plain terrible. This movie definitely falls into the 'terrible' category. I don't remember watching the first of the sequel. I didn't pay to watch this movie, and it was like watching a vhs tape so i fast forwarded through a lot of it cuz i figured i'd just 'waste' less time.  I can't believe Bruce Springsteen's sister acts in this. He must be humiliated by it as she can't act!  The acting overall, as in many of the camper type horror movies, is horrendous!  Got 90 minutes to "waste"? Like stupid horror movies with really bad acting? Then by all means, watch this stinker.   However, Angela(the killer and The Boss's sis) certainly found some very interesting and original ways to kill people.  Also, the scene where she is fishing and pulls up a hockey mask is sort of funny, as I'm sure it was meant to be.  It seemed fitting and almost makes this film look like more of a spoof of the genre as opposed to an actual scary movie. The acting is terrible, all the characters are morons, but wait there's more! If you like nudity, you will at least get to see some half naked women.   I am still willing to give the first 'sleepaway camp' a viewing after hearing that it's a good horror movie 
 Like Carpenter, Ballard suffers from poor execution of some good ideas. John Carpenter may or may not have been a good director once (depending on your point of view), but for the past 20 years he has consistently put out movies where the premise looks engaging on paper (Prince of Darkness, They Live, etc.), but quickly fall into a semi-coherent mess. Likewise Ballard, who is at best coasting on the reputation of a 30 year old book. Ballard has had some great visionary ideas, but his sad insistence on overfocusing on sexual perversion as a compelling/repelling drive for his characters got tired a long, long time ago. If Tom Robbins was a humorless German surgeon instead of an aging hippie, you'd get a close approximation of Ballard's hang-ups. In Ballard's world, all forms of sexual expression are deviant, creepily desperate, and universally abundant. Ballard no longer seems like a literary provocateur, but more like a pedophilic, self-important older uncle that your family would rather not discuss. "Super-Cannes" is Ballard's rewrite of "Fight Club", with the rich and powerful assuming the roles of the disillusioned and powerless 
 I liked the movie "White Chicks" but this movie was not near as good, but it had a few good laughs. It was really hard to take this movie at all serious no matter how hard I tried. How could they not tell that he was an adult?? Little man had a tattoo, and so much more things that any normal person would realize that he isn't a baby. I know I know this is a movie but I thought that it would have been a little less stupid and more funny. They really made this movie outrageously stupid as it looked better on the previews, but I did have a feeling it would be this way.   
 In this short book, Wolfe purports to tell us that the entire American art scene (ie ALL abstract art) of the post-WWII years is nothing but verbiage, a creation of a bunch of second-rater critics. I find this kind of generalization absolutely breathtaking in its arrogance and facile dismissiveness.  By what criterion does Wolfe make this judgment?  By the fact that there were a bunch of high-falutin' critics who explained it to those who wanted to be taken by fashion.  While this is a common enough phenomenon in a nationalistic sense (pride in the output of one's country), I think it only applies to individuals rather than an entire scene.  Afterall, the astract artists like Pollack belonged to a continuous milieu, which runs the gamut from Bob Dylan and John Coltrane right through the Beat Generation writers and Pollack and his cohorts and even TV like the Outer Limits and Twilight Zone.  Were all of them and all they did first rate?  Perhaps not, but I wd argue that there area a lot of wonderful things there as well, reflections of a time even if they don't quite measure up to the earlier generation of modernists like Picasso and Matisse.  I wd not dismiss them so cavalierely, so cynically, as if you can emcompass all they stood for in a single argument.  This book is for those who want to appear as glib smartas*es 
 Many of the essays in this collection appear to be a forceful attack on the sovereignty of Indian tribes, spun as a bizarre imitation form of radical Indian rights activism.  A common theme is the angry defiance of  Indian tribes' right to decide who their memers are.  Jaimes makes this  argument most directly in an essay called "Federal Indian  Identification Policy," in which she claims that Indian tribes copied  their enrollment methods from a congressional statute, the 1887 General  Allotment Act.  However, contrary to Jaimes's assertions, the General  Allotment Act in fact never contained the "blood quantum"  standard that Jaimes accuses Indian tribes of imitating.  Ultimately, the  false information about Indian tribes spread by Jaimes and other  contributors to this volume amounts to a meritless attack on Indian tribes  and a concentrated effort to confuse the public about Indian issues  generally.  Unfortunately, since most readers know so little about Indian  political issues, many will unwittingly take this propaganda as gospel  truth. The predictable result will be greater oppression for Indian tribes  and Indian people 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 Here in Brazil, about ten years ago, I tried to read this bad book, but I never finished it.I tried to read, one book printed in Argentina, wrote in spanish.This book is bad about even guerrilla warfare. In fact, never any of the tatics describe in this book gave victory to any army or revolution.The sucess in Cuba, came not from victory in battle.In fact, never happened a single battle in cuban revolution.It came from the cowardy of Batista and his mafia's government. Ever when an army or even mercenaries TRIED to defeat Che Guevara, they got it, very fast and whith no dificulties.This happened in Congo, to exemple.Finally, in Bolivia, who wasn't and never was a military power, Che was ridiculous at guerrilla.Even so, Che Guevara was easily defeated in Bolivia, and murdered soon after surrendered in 1967. In fact, any guerrilla in this world got any military victory, using Guevara's tatics and theories. Many parts of Latin America had communists taking power, but in any of then using guerrilla warfare. The ever used Gramsci's theories and books to take the power. Brazil is an exemple.Our communists tried some guerrillas, using Cuba's money and support between 1960 and 1974.All of then were easily and fast defeated. After all, our left has total control of this coutry, but from press, scools, TVs, etc. control. As Antonio Gramsci wrote in 1930's Italy, when the left controls the intelectuals, the media, the school sistem, all society is put under left's control without a single shot. This happened in Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela,etc 
 This book did not live up to expectations.  The discussions of the rounds did not tell the reader enough useful information.  There were a lot of fun to know facts - amaze your friends and all of that - but not enough information on how to use the round, good ranges to sight in the various rounds versus potential uses, reloading insights (best loads, best rifle twists for what bullet weight) and more of that kind of technical information.  That is why I only gave the book two stars 
 Well after purchasing Neaderthin I do have to admit that at least my wallet lost weight.  I digested this Neaderthal treatise over several hours and was left with severe intellectual hunger pangs.  Save your money, anyone who wants my edition can have it for postage (you pay the postage, first come, first serve).  Good grief, what a  waste of time and money!  Well at least learn from my mistake and save yourselves. Don't bother with it, the premise is foolish and the proof merely anecdotal tripe supported by bootstraped deductions.  Be sensible, consume something sensible...perhaps Covert Bailey, among the dozens of worthy authors currently available 
 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 Bottom line:  I like Al Bielek's version of the PX better.  This one is more to the original story.  I like Al Bielek's personal account of time traveling.  This book is more about the "facts" of the account.  No Al Bielek in this book 
 I was disappointed in the book.  I expected it to be an exciting documentation of the things that go right and things that go wrong during flight testing, along with detailed "ride in the right seat" descriptions of how he came through the tense moments.  Instead it seemed like it was mostly a litany of people he worked with and the designations of plane that they had experience flying.  Even the tense moments that were documented failed to evoke emotion in me.  They were mostly fairly sterile descriptions of what happened - which is certainly best for the scientific test flight reports, but adds nothing to the desire of the reader to "be there."  It is probably this trait that made Mr. Mallick an exceptional test pilot, but, unfortunately, not an exciting author 
 TRUST THE MAN is a director and a scriptwriter (Bart Freundlich) looking for a reason to justify this shallow, ill conceived, and ultimately boring movie.  Supposedly we are to examine role reversal in modern marriages and the rise of the feminist to the head of the household.  This is about stay at home dads, successful working moms, varying physical and psychological needs, failure to commit guys, and approaching the end of fertility zone women - and each of the four characters in the film try to make us care about their plights but just can't get past the clumsy script.  The cast is as fine as could be assembled to try to make this story matter: Julianne Moore with David Duchovny, Maggie Gyllenhaal with Billy Crudup, and such 'extras' as Garry Shandling, Sarah Knowlton, Dagmara Dominczyk and Justin Bartha.  The four leads are always a pleasure to watch, even in a poor film, but put naive lines in their mouths and we just cringe.  The ending is chicken soup without the healing factor.  In the end this is a film to watch only for the leads: maybe turn off the sound...?  Grady Harp, February 07  
 I agree with a previous review that you get what you pay for.  But in the future I would highly recommend paying more once instead of having to replace this food in a few months or so.  We received this as a gift and from the outside it looked like an great choice!  I was very happy.  But we have had this package of food for about one week and I am already taping boxes with packaging tape to keep them together.  Little hands can pull apart the milk, juice and snack boxes in no time.  The cans of food are so small that they topple over easily in the play kitchen.  The pies, pizza, and such food are all actually hollow underneath.  There is no base to them.  They tell you 101 pieces but in our kit it counted 8 hotdogs (without buns), 12 individual french fries and the same on potato chips.  Not necessary especially since you also get two french fry packets in a french fry container and you get a hot dog in a bun separately.  Why would my child want four jalepenos too.  So much of this food is not they type of thing a small child would be familiar with.  Anyway, in my opinion spend the money on a smaller quantity of higher quality food or go online and find the "vintage" Fisher Price or Little Tikes food.  Now those are made to last and of good size for small hands.  
 I realize that this book is for "Idiots", but come on.  Shallow coverage of HRM.  I can't believe the author reviewed his own book and gave himself 5 stars.  He's not biased at all.  Not worth the money. 
 Dinesh D'Souza, who emigrated here from Calcutta in 1978, displays a level of ignorance of American history, politics, economics and culture that is laughable.  But for the Immigration Reform Act of 1965 - which was bitterly opposed by those conservatives who now treat D'Souza as their pet token, yet which was pushed through by the liberals he so despises - D'Souza probably wouldn't even be in this country.  For him to accuse both Pat Buchanan AND the Rev. Jesse Jackson of "hating" America demonstrates the pathetic level of his discourse.  Don't bother 
      If you are an intellectual idiot, you will love this book!  It waters down every important philosophical idea to the predjudicial opinions of one man who basically tries to use moral persuasion to "sell" his point of view but never backs up any of his "quotes" with footnotes of the "great philosphers" he is trying to "teach" us about!  NO DIRECT QUOTES!!  Yikes. Who can take this book seriously?       I don't think Plato would appreciate being watered-down in this way with neither footnotes to his brilliant, original work, nor any index. NO INDEX!!  Ask yourself this one question before wasting your money on this book:  "Why do I need a philosophy book written by an amateur who doesn't even consider me intelligent enough to make an index for me at the back of this book so I can look up topics as I want to?"  If, for example, you want to look up Plato, and what pages mentions his work in this "philosophy book" by Mr. Adler, you can't because there's no index.        As a classical homeschooler for the past nine years, I have to say I would NEVER ask my teenagers to read this book.  It's just not a serious enough philosophy book to waste their time with.  They are better off reading bits of Plato in the original than hearing the predjudicial opinions of Mr. Adler who's preaching, persuading, and glossing over details would make the money and time spent on it a total waste.  If you still want to read it, go to the library where it's free and decide then and there whether it's worth it.        It's simply unacceptable to have neither footnotes nor index in a book such as this 
 Generations of sad dingbats have stood on mountains waiting for some all-important 'End Time', and when the predicted dates come and go, is anyone dissuaded?  Of course not. They just re-interpret the same old ambiguities and come up with another date. "No, really, THIS TIME we KNOW we've got it right."  Because books like this exploit the terminally self-centred, who want it all to be about 'ME'.  "I" will be there when it all happens. It's all for "MY" generation. It's all focused on "ME".  LaHaye and Jenkins  clearly capitalise on these feelings, as have generations before them.  Nobody ever went broke overestimating the gullibility of the human race 
 This movie added a world war, changed the continent the story took place on, and then brought the dead back to life. To me, once the essential elements of the author's story are that fundamentally altered, it's not fair to use the title anymore. I realize a number of the changes are a 'tribute' to the Shirley Temple version, but I'd hoped that since the new version wasn't a star vehicle they might have returned to more of the original storyline, but no. At least the first movie was on the correct continent! I like the movie, believe it or not, but it's not the story I read until the first book fell apart, and the changes to the story I listed weren't necessary, and it may have been nice to see that things can work out even when a parent stays dead 
 On its own merits, Stone's book deserves only one star, but because it has brought Socrates to the attention of a wider audience than he otherwise would have it gets a second star.  Maybe Stone learned Attic Greek in order to write this book, and maybe he didn't.  Nothing Stone wrote in this book required analysis of primary sources or any depth of knowledge of Attic Greek, in contrast with the truly scholarly work on Socrates, which often turns on the evaluation of subtle stylistic and linguistic evidence in the ancient sources.  Stone's methods are those of the advocate, the special pleader, and the polemicist, which of course is what he was for his entire journalistic career. He was clearly not a scholar, in spite of his pretensions.  He would have fit in quite well with the clever Sophists Socrates had so much fun arguing against, and so little respect for.  Perhaps Stone had a grudge against Socrates because  Socrates would never have taken Stone seriously had the two ever  met.  Socrates would no doubt have taken Stone apart just like he did everyone else he encounters in Plato's Dialogues.  The idea that Socrates could have used a "free speech" defense at his trial in ancient Athens is preposterous.  The Athenian democracy quite frequently fined, exiled, or put to death its citizens for the flimsiest of reasons.  One has only to read Thucydides to learn this.  There was no First Amendment in  ancient Athens.  Athenian law was whatever a jury said it was on any given day.  It was for good reason that pure democracy as practiced by Athens developed such a bad reputation that it has never been seriously tried since.  A good antidote to Stone's screed is the paper by Gregory Vlastos called "The Historical Socrates and Athenian democracy", which appears in his book "Socratic Studies".  Vlastos also wrote a critical review of Stone's book in The New York Review of Books.  It should be noted that Vlastos identified himself as being Leftist in his personal political views, but didn't let that interfere with his scholarship.  And I doubt that he ever let KGB agents take him out to lunch 
 I purchased these Teva's for Kayaking. These are the most uncomfortable sandals I have ever worn.  They are even painful while sitting in a boat.  I do not recommend them 
 Quit buying this junk that pseudoscientists are selling to make a quick buck.    Sharks do get cancer.  A scientific study done by researchers at the Mayo Clinc showed not only that this stuff doesn't work, but "toxicity related to shark cartilage resulted in significant trial drop out after one month. 
 Okay, so the exercises ARE good. The abs exercises on most of the FIRM tapes that have them ARE good. But I still think it was a mistake ordering this tape for two reasons: 1. It's just a collection of routines from other, earlier FIRM tapes, so to me it pretty much seems like a rip-off. Also, get ready for some OLD ones there - from the time when instructors looked like Kate Moss and even guys were wearing pink and orange aerobics clothes. If you ever felt like you didn't quite enjoy looking at such things anymore - well, then you'll find this tape a visual disaster. 2. Who is this Tracy guy, for heaven's sake?! All he does is introducing the sets of exercises - half naked and looking as unnatural as a diamond ring on a homeless guy's pinky. He's ridiculous, but he's actually too annoying for me to be able to simply laugh at him. Altogether, this tape was a disappointment and the two stars are strictly for the exercises 
 It wasn't a bad movie except for all the killing. How about a nice movie where people just get along? Instead, this crazy michael myers guy runs around killing all the teenie weeners and ruins halloween for everyone. This character totally ruined the movie. Pleasent Donald demonstrated some good acting but I had a hard time telling him apart from that buttugly Jamie Lee Curtis 
 This CD is okay the first few times you listen to it, but it will grate on you by the 5th time. Some of the songs sound hillibilly and twangy, sing about topics that are not of special interest to kids, don't rhyme or are catchy, and don't teach anything 
 This book contains some of the worst exegesis I have ever read (and I've read some bad stuff from time to time).  This author has such a poor approach to the text and draws such ridiculous conclusions that I am astounded.  It is books like this that kept me away from Christianity for many years, and even now that I have gone back to the church and consider myself a Christian, books like this make me want to run screaming away again.  Argh!    A few examples: she thinks the washing of Jesus' feet by a prostitute's hair was an erotic act (it was actually the act of a slave and similar to what Jesus later did for his disciples).  She also links this prostitute with Mary Magdalene, a common but unbiblical error (Mary Magdalene was possessed by seven demons; she was not a prostitute).  Also, I know that Christians often disparage the Tanakh (Hebrews scriptures, dismissively called the Old Testament) but her treatment of these scriptures is unusually (shockingly, appallingly) anti-Semitic.  She also twists herself in knots trying to show that she doesn't agree with the Catholic honoring of Mary (ironically using the same verses that Catholics use to show that Mary is the mother of the Church to mean somehow that Jesus disowned Mary as his physical mother!).  This kind of bizarre, twisted exegesis is the very reason millions of people are leaving Christianity.  Honestly, this author went into the Bible with an idea of what she wanted to prove and then twisted the text to fit her points.  This would not convince anyone with even a basic education, and as people become more educated, they leave the church over just this type of mishandling of the text.  Unless you enjoy reading things with such tangled reasoning that you need Tylenol afterwards and a cool cloth over your forehead, I'd suggest avoiding this one 
 My previous Back to Basics model expired in less than two months when the teeth engaging the blade simply stripped. The lightweight model pictured here fared less well, lasting for one smoothie: when I tried to use it a second time, it was, to quote Dickens, "dead as a door nail."  If the same happens to this "Plus" unit, you'll have on hand more useless items than the blender itself. (The good part is its distribution by Amazon, assuring no-hassle returns and refunds.)   It's a nice concept--make your smoothie on the run, and have one less glass to wash.  If you still want to try a small-sized blender, I've had surprising success with the cheap and tiny Hamilton-Beach personal blender 
 Its all fine to give players every option ever thought of to create characters but it makes no sense in not balancing the game for playability when it comes to being a gamemaster.  Like a good producer/director/screenwrite all n one, the gamemaster must create a world , an adventure, all the villains, npcs and monsters and make the game fun for the players.  In order to do that the GM must know all the rules and be up on ever character type put in front of him.  that's not to say it is impossible just very tedious for the gamemaster who must make the game enjoyable for ALL the players.  There are many more problems, Bad presentation...the background noise and artwork are not that good on the eyes so those of us that have to get out magnifying glasses to try and read the gm guide an player's handbook will have a harder time of it.  IN any event, I think it is poorer quality than ALL the previous versions of the game.  I have gm'd for 17 years and I am truly disappointed 
 Fragmented Self is the same as the devil?  This is a wonderful book turned into a New-Agey gooblygook treatise.  It is still wonderful to read, but her rewording is so heavy handed and obvious that is destroyed a lot of the beauy of the work.  She states in her preface that she's stuck in her spiritual journey. Maybe if she'd actually read and meditate on a book without changing it to be all-inclusive she'd have better luck.  Dont pass this excellent work by, just get another translation 
 In many ways a relic of its era, "Not of This Earth" is the first widely distributed release by Joe Satriani (a previous EP ended up being reissued as part of "Time Machine", years later).  The guitarist, supported by drummer Jeff Campitelli and percussionist John Cuniberti came into public attention when Steve Vai, a former student of Satriani, ended up singing his teacher's praises in the music press.  The result is that this album, more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music, received wider recognition and poised Satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record.  The album itself is a bit uneven-- Satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist, but as a songwriter, he wasn't quite ready.  Several pieces ("Not of This Earth", "Hordes of Locusts") seem to run out of steam before they end, and a couple ("The Snake", "Driving At Night") feel like bad '80s metal.  On the other hand, several pieces shine-- delicate and lovely "Rubina", reggaeish and emotionally soaked "Memories", and the overtly Frippesque "New Day" are all fine examples of what Satriani is capable of.  But my favorite is probably "Brother John", where Satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone.  In the end, the album is ok, but Satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future.  Come back to this one if you've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more, but most should start with "Surfing With the Alien" 
 This is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills.  It would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner.  The shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery.  The politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray; I can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script:  Bong-hitting liberal student who has no clue about the real world #1:  ...and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing... BHLSWHNCATRW #2: (Interrupts)  "Evil Corporation"?  Why are you being redundant?  The only plus for my wife and I was the acting, which was great.  Fiennes was especially good, underplaying his character in the early parts of the film, resulting in a character with depth and nuance.  I only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it 
 Like other reviewers, I found MeetThe Parents mildly amusing and this sequel was in the 3 for $25 bin at Hollywood so I figured "Why not?" Well here's why not. It presents the main character's parents as crude, clueless buffoons, and having no social judgement whatsoever, but it seems the writers want the audience to think of them as cool and hip. And for some odd reason they live in a house that resembles the castle on Fantasy Island. I'm surprised they didn't include a sex with a midget scene. Nobody would want their daughter to marry into this family let alone a right wing former CIA agent, who was set up as an object of ridicule. Oh, and they had to be Jewish too. Streisand and Hoffman should be ashamed of themselves portraying their own people in such an unflattering way. {"Our people don't shoot ducks, dear") Do former CIA agents make enough money to live in mansions and buy a custom built RV that would cost at least $250 k? The toilet humor and profanity wouldn't have made it into "Dumb and Dumber" Nothing reedeming or funny here. Fuhgeddaboutit 
 This is an extremely superficial book. While the premise is good, the arguments are poorly developed. The author obviously wrote it to cash in on his notoriety from the OJ case 
 It was done in 1905.  Was once called "THE JUNGLE" by Upton Sinclair.  Done far better then too.  Avoid this remake.  Much like Hollywood remake of classics, it does a true disservice rather than anything else 
 At first when I heard there was going to be a movie with Romulans, I was going "SWEET!"  The movie bombs, simple as that.  Forget all the little things like Riker breaking his word to only take the Captain's Chair of the Enterprise, even after Enterprise-D was destroyed.  Forget the previous peice treaty with the Romulans.  It stunk on every level.  And I grew up on TNG.  They cut off half the main cast, and killed off Data.  Ok, so the actor doesnt want to do Star Trek,  Hey, after the way that movie stunk, I'll have a heart attack if they make another.  But if they leave the slight chance that the entire cast will be there...come on  And of course the major battle.  Two Romulan Warbirds come in to help, and get disabled in SECONDS.  Where's the action?  If you do get this moive, it's a waste of your time 
   I quote from the introduction to the book: "The stories that appear in this book are those of individual people and, in one case, a composite of several..." Since when does a researcher combine individual stories to create a 'composite of several'? This important sentence questions the accuracy and validity of the stories in this book.  Why won't the author tell us which stories she considers 'individual' and which one is the 'composite'. What if the composite story is the one that is emphasized, the one that the author keeps going back to?  The book is a worthwhile read for someone like me, who lives in the hasidic community, and who is wondering whether others, too, are unhappy with so many restriction. The good thing about this book is that it mentions (if you read the notes in tiny print in the back) the existence of an organization that caters to people who are trying to leave the hasidic way of life. That organization might indeed serve an important purpose, if it is being done correctly. Young hasidic boys whose English and academic skills are poor need outside assistance and support if they want to be able to choose their own way of life.  But I would not believe the details in each story until the author clarifies. I would not suggest this as a worthwhile read for someone trying to learn about hasidim from the outside. It is too negative. Try watching 'A Life Apart'. I found the atmosphere and mood of that movie to be quite charming. It is a good starting point. There are other books out there that I have not read that cover the hasidic way of life from different viewpoints. Don't let this be the only book you read!  To read the section of the author's introduction that I referred to, simply place your mouse on the image of the book and a search box will pop up. Type in 'composite of several' and read the page that comes up.   As I read in a previous review, the author should publish her final dissertation, if it exists, the one that prompted all this research, so that we can get an accurate portrayal of these hidden lives and of how the data was collected. 
 When I tried the device in my laptop, it has crashed my laptop every time.  I have not had the time to try and contact the technical support yet.  I am just very disappointed that I haven't been able to get it installed.  
 This is the third installment in the Mitch Rapp series and the author's fourth book overall. (I'd suggest reading the previous books both for chronology reasons and that they're better reads.) Mitch is America's #1 "go to" guy when it comes to fighting terrorism. In "Separation of Power" he is faced with cleaning up some open issues from his last mission (someone tried to kill him), the political "in-fighting" surrounding the naming of a new CIA chief, rogue Mossad agents, Iraq gaining nuclear weapons and falling in love. One could be forgiven in thinking this last issue would make for a pleasant diversion while our hero prevents WW III. Not so. Mitch's romance takes a front and center position and in a word is well ... comedic. The "action" threads of the plot - which this author has worked so well in his previous books - is hinted at in the first 100 pages, doesn't really begin until after 200 pages - and then proceeds in fits and starts. There is an inordinate amount of "character development" - self-serving, amoral, scheming politicans & our world weary, battle scarred reluctant hero Mitch, who must once again pick up the sword to do what no other man can do - which like the "romance" impedes the plot. The book hastily concludes, (20+ pages), in an unsatisfying and simplistic finale. Hopefully this book is an anomaly in the series because the author's previous books were great roller coaster rides and provided entertaining reading at the beach and in airports. Unfortunately the much rushed conclusion and Mitch's "new" situation doesn't guarantee that.   
 I received nothing of sailing value beyon paying attention to the local tide tables, along with ebb & flood flows... The story was interesting on how two fellows of different social levels were able to enjoy time on a small boat.  The ending left me empty and unsatisfied.  If you are from or sailed the North Sea area of East Friesland (Germany), it will be most interesting, because of the detailed maps of the area.  Looks simular as seen from GoogleEarth map 
 This is a TV dance pad, not the authentic DDR pad as we ordered.  My children were disappointed in the music, graphics, and the lack of challenging levels of difficulty.  They said it was "cheesy" 
 The whole thing was just awful, I don't mind telling you.  I don't know why anyone would buy the book for the recipes to start with when there are so many "meals in 30 minutes" internet sites...all completely nutritional with different caloric contents. Then there's the advice...it was just as bad, I found. Well, bad in the sense that it was silly.  Really quite silly.  I must admit that I must agree with the reviewer that said if you are eating an entire plate of French Fries, or Freedom Fries, depending, and you don't know that you are eating something that is going to put some pounds on, then reading this book isn't going to help you.  It does kind of sound like the positive reviews are all written by people that know the author personally.  Sounds a little bit like the Pentagon's planted news stories in Iraq if you don't mind my saying 
 If you read the dedication, you understand why she wrote this book.  However, she has placed too much emphasis on her agenda, and that really distracts from the hetero relationship of the book.  Like another reviewer below, I love her books, but don't think this is her best romance novel.  I really didn't care about either person in the hetero relationship, and was far too distracted by the other relationship in the book.  I understand that she may want to promote understanding and compassion for gay relationships, but I don't read romance novels to get schooled in liberal thought (and didn't need an education in broadmindedness).  I read them for hot, steamy hetero couples.  Frankly, I didn't like the setting for this one (a movie stage), either.  The last time she did a book based on acting/the stage ("Heart Throb"), I was equally unimpressed.  I thought the male lead was wimpy, which is why I'm such a fan of the Seal books she has done.  This Seal book is definitely a let-down 
 The problem with any BOC package is they try to combine music from a band the was the coolest group between 1971-74, and a commercial group that produced some of the lamest music I've ever heard.  This package only includes 4 songs from their legendary first 3 albums, 11 cuts from their commercial period.  If your new to BOC, your have to understand, earlier in their career, they were as good as a hard rock act as there was.  They combined top flight muscianship, with cleverly crafted melodies and riffs.  The comparasons to Sabbath are only partially accurate in describing their style, because BOC played a more dynamic and colorful range of tunes.  In fact, musically, I'd say they had more in common with Deep Purple, particulary in the guitar department.  Buck Dharma was simply the most under rated guitar player....ever.  Clapton was God, Hendrix was flamboyant, Page was a genius, Blackmore was tempermental, Johnny Winter was an albino, Leslie West was fat, and Buck Dharma, well he just looked like a working-class stiff, but man could that man jam!  The rhythm section was propulsive, they played organ when appropriate, and all of the songs had hooks.  They were rare then, and they'd be rare today, a hard rock outfit with strong pop sensibilities.  So much so, you have to wonder if Eric Bloom and Jeff Lynne aren't the same person?  At any rate BOC perfected their attack on Secret Treaties, and rapidly lost their commitment to rock n' roll during Agents fo Fortunes and all albums there after.  The other Best of... package to avoid is Workshop of Telescopes.  Eventhough it has a better song selection, the songs haven't been remastered and many of the versions are from poorly recorded live and promo albums.  Instead of going for a compilation, I strongly recommend purchasing any one of the recently remastered first 3 albums, which sound dramatically better than the originals 
 The problem with this is that (as it appears to me) VillaWare has tried to cut corners by re-using all but the plates as it has on it's Panini Grill (which for the record is an excellent product - which I have given rave reviews).  Check out the Panini Grill - unless you had these products in front of you & were able to open them up, you'd never be able to tell the difference between them.  I would say, don't write off VillaWare products just because of one poor one, as I said I also own the Panini Grill & LOVE IT!!!!!!!!  However, don't waste your money on this one - I hope VillaWare does right by their respected name & pulls this off the market completely.    One thing I will say, the "audible warning sound" that was mentioned in a previous review is actually a click - the same as the Panini Grill, but listen carefully or you'll miss it 
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second. 
 I was so dissapointed by this book! I read the first two and thought while they were not up to Julia London's previous books, they were light airplane reads. After 50 pages of Rachel not doing anything but letting her friends use her and eat, I was bored, bored, bored.  I only skimmed throught to see her parents moving forward.   I do not recommend this book at all 
 I have been reading James Patterson's books since the first Alex Cross came out. I thought the first 3 or 4 Cross books were brilliant but since then I feel the standard has dropped gradually to where we reach London Bridges.  This book has a solid storyline that needed fleshing out but I think the author was in too much of a rush to get the book on the shelves to worry about the story.  Let me get this right - Alex's family are taken hostage in the final few pages of the book, we get a couple of pages devoted to Cross' work and then the family is returned. There was no discussion on the anguish Alex was facing, nothing on the fear that the family was facing, nothing written about this at all! It would have been better to have taken them at the start of the book and have the book devoted to the fear that Alex was facing and his determination to catch the Wolf and get his family back.  If Alex was so dedicated to catching the Wolf, why was he taking so many time-outs throughout the book to visit little Alex, have dinner with his numerous friends etc?  Most disappointing, Mr Patterson 
 The obvious attitude of the producers of this mess was clearly one of superiority.  I mean, "After all, we're shooting in IMAX 3D instead of the nefarious over/under format!"  Well, whoopdeedoo!  I'll take THE BUBBLE, METALSTORM, or AMITYVILLE 3D any day over this.  There is some nice computer graphics work here, but there's really no story to speak of.  And their so-called "history of 3D presentation" is superficial at best.  While surely impressive in Imax, ENCOUNTER looks stupid on your TV screen 'cause everything is covered in a long shot or a medium long shot.  Yes, that may work on the giant behemoth Imax screen, but reduce it in size to your TV (even my big 36-inch JVC) and it's pretty unimpressive.  Not only that, but if you're watching it in alternating-field 3D with liquid crystal glasses, then you're watching it in half the normal resolution you normally see on your NTSC screen -- so there's next to NO picture detail.  If you want a good 3D DVD movie, search the web for one of the alternating field DVD's of something like IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, HOUSE OF WAX, or DIAL M FOR MURDER (sadly only available in 3D via pirated editions because the US distributors don't care enough to bother -- so were only left with legit DVD's of crap like ENCOUNTERS and amatuer videos of murderous clowns on the rampage).  I would have given this two stars because it features (very briefly) Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson -- BUT THEY COVERED HER ONLY IN LONG SHOT TOO!  They were REALLY stooopid, so they get one star.  Boo 
 All "style" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The "Entertainer" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over.  
 See, you have to think? Why does the cheese keep moving? The simple answer is that it doesn't want to be around these mice. From the cheese's point of view the mice are trying to destroy it, thus it has to keep moving in order to save itself. Let me try to relate it in a real world scenerio. This is a story I like to tell when I meet up with some old friends, after a high school reunion. I was given this book by my terrible boss, and told I had to read it. I did. A few days later my boss accused me of stealing one of the two copies of this book that had been bought for the entire store. But, brave readers, I took inspiration from the cheese and moved on: to another job.  The en 
 As far as I know, this is the first book on SQLite and for that Chris Newman deserves a compliment. Beyond that, this book is not very useful though: 1) It explains some basic SQL syntax but I didn't buy this book to learn SQL. 2) Very little information about the specifics and pitfalls of SQLite syntax, I rarely find what I'm looking for. 3) Being a PHP developer I don't need the chapters on C++, Perl, TCL and Python (about 25% of the book) 
 The prime rib slices I had were pre-cooked and they are terrible. Nothing like what you would expect from a good restaurant or make at home. They lack in both flavor and texture. The remaining slices I have will probably be sliced up and used in tacos 
 The Rhinoskin case works fine.  The nano fits well in the case.  No problems getting it in and out.  My issue with the case is the weight.  I'm just guessing b/c I don't have tech specs, but it feels like it makes the nano twice as heavy.  One of things I was so excited about when I got my nano was that it was so light.  This case takes the joy out of that.  Don't get me wrong; it's still pretty light.  But other all-plastic cases I've tried don't test the elastic on my shorts as much as this one does 
 This is a horrible book that presents a lot of scattered topics but fails to bound them together. It has a lot of ultra long math formulas on every pages with very brief explainations. The little explaination is done by refering to other abstract formulas which are on other pages! It is totally unreadable and may be it is intended to be a reference book only 
 This is a problem solver book with few diagrams and a lot of newspaper-type pages.  The text is blochy heavy seriffed and is difficult to read.  I have opened it once, maybe twice.  Like your typical problem solvers, you can now find a lot of solutions (even to your specific problem) on the web...for free.  There are a lot of equations and theories, but not enough useful stuff for applying these equations to conditions in the real world. The equations are not numbered well and it is impossilbe to tell between interemediate derivations and the final useful equations. Unless your deep into this stuff, it is not for the typical engineer 
 I ordered two of the authors book's based on raving reviews from a friend, not actually this title but another. I ordered this one as well and must say what a total waste of money. The first section of the book is about the authors travels and how she claims she was visited by the Virgin Mary...umm yeah right, there isn't much practicle help in this book at all, only her boring tales of travel around the globe. The second part of the book is a list of goddesses and their qualities. don't bother with this book, it a time waster and $$$ waster I can't believe Hay house published this work of junk. After reading this authors other works I do feel she is very very over rated and has taken the angel working brigade thing a little too far and people have jumped on this band wagon if that wasn't the case this author would be unknown because her writing is terrible. The misleading promises on the back of the book should be taken off as well "Manifest anything you want instantly"...I didn't find anything in the book even about *helping* your life, it was all about her travels...Like I said a total joke..I won't be so easily led when buying books by spiritual workers again. 
 James Patterson's Violets Are Blue is another of his Alex Cross mysteries, which are always a good summer read.  However, some are better than others and this isn't one of his best efforts.  I'd rate it 2-1/2 stars.    In Violets Are Blue, Dr. Cross has yet to jump ship to the FBI and is still working for the Washington, DC police force.  He is called to San Francisco when two joggers are found brutally murdered.  Their bodies are hung upside down from a tree and most of their blood has been drained from their bodies.  Their deaths seem to be the work of savages, and Cross had a similar unsolved case back in DC.  At the same time, he is being stalked by The Mastermind, a psychopathic criminal who seems to have a love/hate relationship with Cross.  Cross teams with the capable homicide detective from San Francisco, Jamilla Hughes.  Together, they crisscross the country, trying to follow the trail of savage killings as they try to find the key.    I have enjoyed all of Patterson's books, although the plot to Violets Are Blue is just a bit of a stretch with the vampire angle.  Also, the discovery of the identity of The Mastermind was a complete surprise, but also a bit unbelievable.  In Patterson's defense, I would have probably enjoyed it more had I read this book before The Big Bad Wolf.  If you're a Patterson fan, you have to read Violets Are Blue.  It will tie up some loose ends from previous books.  I will continue to read the exploits of Alex Cross--even though not all Patterson's are created equal.   
 Irvine Welsh has been a lot of things to a lot of different people- some say he's the best thing to happen to British writing in a decade, some say he's just a flash-in-the-pan with uncouth sensibilities who writes thoughtless, violent stories about amoral scumbags. Say what you will about Welsh as a writer- be it that he's talented, sick, brilliant, strange or just plain nuts- but he is, and has never been, boring. Until now. "Marabou Stork Nightmares" is a colossal letdown after the one-two punch of "Trainspotting" and "The Acid House", a jumbled, convoluted tale about a repugnant [man] trawling his last moments away in a life that most closely resembles a bedridden hell. This is not the first first-person account of a psychopath that Welsh has written- see later, his aptly-titled "Filth"- but even at his worst, D.S. Bruce Robertson had a sort of perverse wit to him, while this story lacks anything short of coherence, wit, humor or even plot.  The protagonist of this brutish tale is Roy Strang, a bedridden criminal pissing the last moments of his sad life away in a bed, ready to die. As he slowly slips in and out of consciousness, Roy reflects on the family upbringing- that entailed rape, sexual molestation and the vicious abuse of his right-wing Uncle- that led him to this state. We see later in his life, as Roy attempts to straighten himself out, get a job and "choose life", as it were, but we continue to see that he cannot escape the sins of his past. All the while, he hunts the formidable African Predator the Marabou Stork- a personification of all the misery, evil, hatred, pain and badness in Roy himself- on a wild Safari in Africa, that ostensibly all takes place in Roy's morphine-and-depravity-addled brain.  The novel proves that Welsh can still pull plenty of tricks out of his proverbial hat when it comes to language- some of his bawdy, boy's-night-out Scottish dialogue still provokes a chuckle or two, while the disgusting gangrape scene towards the book's denouement is one of the more haunting I have read in recent memory. And yet, for all its mild pleasures, this book still sees Welsh falling majorly short of the mark, sinking into the endless mire of Roy Strang's egomaniacal fever dream. Consider this one a real "Nightmare" 
 I bought the Dirt Devil a few months ago. I read the reviews on it and despite some bad ones, I decided to go for it. How bad could it be...as long as it sucks up the dirt, right??? Well,                                                                                                                                                                                                     guess what? It doesn't even do that! Its awful on my rugs...I just want it to pick up the cheerios my children eat...instead, the vacuum takes the cheerio, breaks it up into smaller pieces and then spits it out the back! I have the same problem on my tile floors. If I vaccum the kitchen while barefoot, I can feel the dirt getting spit back out towards my feet!  I strongly strongly recommend NOT buying it. I am so disappointed and angry that I spent my money on this vacuum 
 If you take the time to write a biography of a person, isn't it part of one's research to interview their wife? Donya Fiorentino was married to or lived with David Fincher for 5 years and gave him a daughter. When they met, he was directing Pepsi commercials, and when they split up, he was an auteur. For some reason, Sharon Waxman made no effort to interview or contact Donya, and dismisses her in two sentences as an alcoholic and drug addict. In fact, Donya has been sober for 6 years, is a brilliant and creative photographer who has an edgy side to the Fincher story that has never been told. I know the truth; as Donya's physician I have heard her compelling story. Waxman also does not mention that after their divorce, she married Gary Oldman. This was written with my patient's permission, who was very hurt by this book's publication 
   I do not hate Ann Coulter but I do dislike her! In this anthology of articles on the likes of Ms. Coulter; Rush Limbaugh;Bill O'Reilly; Sean Hannity; Michael Savage and the stars of Fox TV, Regency Books and George Wills we see the dark side of these neo-conservative media darlings.   The book contains several articles that are years old. The book is thin on biographical information on the persons who are chronicled and is written by several liberal critics of the radio/TV wars in the age of George W. Bush.   I did learn some facts on these folks I did not know but was somewhat disappointed in this poorly printed on cheap paper paperback 
 As a teen, I eagerly ate up Rinaldi's historical fiction novels. So recently when I found one of her books I hadn't read I was excited.  However, I found this book lacking. Rose Frampton, the 15 year old main character, is based on Rinaldi's own grandmother, but she never fully materialized as a character to me. She was more like a shadowy outline that needed to be filled in. I certainly thought that the diary format would make it easier for us to get inside her head as she experienced major life changes, like her older sister marrying, and she herself marrying an older man from Brooklyn. At least it was on the shorter side 
 When I saw this DVD- I just had to get it, because my husband and I remembered how hilarious that one sketch was - the one where he pretends to be a white man.  But after seeing it again after all these years, I must say that our society has "outgrown" its humor.  It just isn't as funny because we've all grown to accept much edgier comedy, with the likes of Dave Chapelle, Carlos Mencia, etc.  It still was amusing and brought back good memories from back in the day, but it just wasn't as hilariously shocking as it once was 
 Many of the ideas in this book are very contradicting to the bible. Read C.S. Lewis' responce to this book "The Great Divorce" 
 The movie doesn't at all reflect the original book story in its core concept. If I didn't read the book before I wouldn't be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain. I doubt anybody, based on the movie only, would be able to understand what happend in 1968 in the Czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society 
 I look for Linda Howards books as soon as they come out but was dissapointed with this one.  An unbelievable plot can be entertaining but this story was to much.    
 unable to view because of incompatible format (as you warned me!)However, my ancestor James McLintock of Barnsley, Yorkshire, England sent John Wayne an eiderdown quilt for making the film (which is why I wanted the DVD)so..... 
 There are a few facts that Ms. McMillan seems to ignore. The first fact I glean not from this book but from the KGB archives. According to the docent I encountered in their museum: Oppenheimer, though not himself a Soviet spy, was aware of  USSR espionage at Los Alamos and turned a blind eye to this treasonous activity. The Atomic Energy Commission was rightly suspicious and, if anything, under reacted when they stripped Oppenheimer of his clearance.  As to the suggestion that Edward Teller was less a humanitarian than Oppenheimer, let's not forget that Teller (and others) petitioned the U.S. government to use the first nuclear bomb on a military and not a civilian target. Oppenheimer favored the policy that prevailed- unleashing these weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
 I'm dog-obsessed and was looking for a cool dog calendar for 2007... I love M.E. but I could not find a good description - or preview of what was actually in this calendar. I think the title is misleading in that A Year with ME - could mean a year with MARY ENGELBRIET -- not "me". And You Lucky Dog! - like she's holding on the cover might mean the calendar is filled with adorable lucky dogs. It's not. It's cute, but not what I was looking for.. the search continues - can't find a cute illustrated DOG calendar 
 In the past, I have purchased several of the Gazetteer maps. One of the chief reasons I purchase a Topo type map is because I am a Rockhound. A large portion of good minerals and rock formations are generally located at or near mines. The Gazetteer has always been a quick and easy reference for roads and trails to these areas. Not so with the New Mexico version. I have found no mines or quarries anywhere within this map. I feel cheated for if I had looked at it prior to purchase, I would not have bought it 
 Buy this book only if you know nothing about exercise and fitness.  It contains only the very basic information.  The workouts are too easy and 8 min is not nearly enough to start any fat burning.  However, it is very entertaining to read the personal stories of the people that managed to lose weight 
 I haven't seen the show, but I certainly hope it works better on stage with visuals than it does listening to this tepid CD. Not a memorable note of music in the entire score 
 This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo 
 This is not what I expected it to be at all! It did not come with a pole and it did not improve my skills. If at all it made my wrist hurt more. 
 The author divides the books into sections by elements--good enough for organization of material.  She provides lists of correspondences.  Fine, could be useful.  What it does not do is provide any real information.  We get a lot of watered-down fantasy novel-style "vision quests" or "seekings," encounters the author alleges to have experienced.  These "experiences" form the bulk (and I do mean bulk) of the book.  Apparently, one is supposed to envision one's self in the author's role.  There is no explanation given for the structure of these pathworkings (the kindest thing I can call them), which are interspersed with commentary about the author's "Native American family."  (She claims to have been adopted into a Native American clan.)  She makes many references to possible Native American teachings, but offers no source material, how to seek out further information about topics she urges readers to explore more fully.  The terminology she uses is just authentic-enough to sound legitimate, but so vague they reveal nothing.  (An example:  the examination of a crystal the author has on a staff.  A tribal elder who is apparently one of her teachers examines it and gravely announces it used to be a Grandfather crystal.  So what, exactly, is a Grandfather crystal, and why is it mounted in a Wiccan-style staff?  With runes, no less.)  Even more suspiciously, many of her "Native American teachings" sound like something out of a Hollywood script than anything one might imagine being part of an actual oral tribal tradition, passed down from shaman to student.  Lastly, there are pages and pages of meaningless diagrams and a list of colored "rays" that will bring all kinds of good things into one's life if one meditates on them.  The entire book reads like a Wiccan primer with a glaze of pseudo-Native American spirituality as seen by Caucasians.  I have read other books on shamanism, and many stress their adoptive connections to the parent culture.  (A good experience for them if it actually happened, but one can hardly expect readersto stampede over and demand adoption.)  And yet this information, supposedly kept within these families and tribes for centuries, is now being set out in print for the mass consumption of the reading public.  Well, what was the point of being 'adopted'?  If these 'adoptive families' wanted this information public, wouldn't they have written a book themselves?  Some of the more honest books on shamanism admit they are witholding certain information because some knowledge *should* be kept 'in the family'.  They openly say they are creating something for use by people living in the modern age.  Wolfe has done none of this. Waste of time to read.  Waste of space on my bookshelf.  Waste of trees to print it.  Waste of *plastic* for the bag I carried it home in.  I'd be embarrassed to even turn this thing to a used bookstore for credit. 
 I bought these shoes to do aerobics in. They look good and are comfortable, but only to walk in. There is zero arch support and when I walk in them I feel as if my feet are flat on the ground. There is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics. My old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones, but I can't use the old ones. The gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes. They are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt. I am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location. Now I have to look again 
 Beware! This book is no serious science book, it's no more than a paper-incarnation of a big poor joke.. Unfortunately, it's the textbook being used in my fluid dynamics class and I had to buy this one. But if you have a choice, pick "Fluid Mechanics, Third Edition (Hardcover) by Ira M. Cohen (Author), Pijush K. Kundu (Author)"! It is easily understandable and nice to read and covers all important concepts and equations in a reasonable form!!  In contrast, this book by Bruce R. Munson does not even derive the heart of fluid dynamics, the Navier Stokes equation in general (just a washed down version in one coordinate system, written in components), nor does it derive the Bernoulli equation in an appropriate way to emphasize the restrictions and applicability.. Also, almost every equation is given in components, not utilizing vector (or tensor) notation... This hides the beauty and natural look of the equations and makes it just worse to read..  Overall, this is a really bad book, stay away from it 
 At the moment Extreme sat on stools and strummed the opening bars to this drivel for all the sentimental fools that were gullable enough to but this, they put the final nail into the rock scene coffin. Sure, other bands played ballads, but MTW was the final straw.  How could good time, long haired, fun rock n' roll ever be able to show it's face in public after this drivel?  We were having a tough enough time with Seattle Grunge making us all miserable and wanting to shoot ourselves, but once this went mainstream we had had it.  If you had long hair and tatoos people equated you with Extreme and More Than Words.  Extreme had such promise and their first two albums showed that there was life after Van Halen, but then they got greedy and ruined it.  If Gary Cherone claimed to have meant even one of those words, he is a liar.  He was a great performer and one of the best front men of the era, but he sold us all out and for that reason I will never forgive hi 
 I've not found anything from Memorex that works right, try Maxell products from Amazon, you can't find better products and the best customer service on the net. 
 Holy moley.  This thing sucked rancid twinkies through a hot garden hose.  Even *if* you could get past the editing, there's the lighting. Even *if* you could get past the lighting, there's the problem with the audio being disastrously out of sync with the video (even in the first scene, when the flute player didn't even come close to keying with the notes...and on and on and on).  Even *if* you got past the editing, lighting, and sync problems, you're still left with a bizarre egomaniac throwing himself around on stage.    No matter HOW good you think he is (and I do agree he's quite talented) it's obvious that Flatley thinks he's even better.  At the expense of the story, the cohesion, and at the expense of the viewers enjoyment, he's out to show how awesome he is.    Which tells me that other than dancing, he doesn't have a lot going for him.  He kind of reminds me of Mighty Mouse... chest puffed out... "Here I come to save the dayyyyyy!!!"  I'll tell you what to save... save your money, put it as the very very last item on your internet dvd rental queue, and hope you never get to it 
 I bought a small one of these with blank, unlined pages as a pocket sketchbook. The pocket sketchbooks commonly sold in art supply stores are one of two varieties, either wire-bound or stitched. The thing is, wire-bound notebooks are uncomfortable to have in a back pocket (and I just don't like the feel, bumping up against the ridges of the wires on that edge), and most stitched bindings don't fold as well as the Moleskine does (folding nice and wide so there's plenty of blank page to use).   And to be honest, I may've fallen just a little for that pompous tripe about being the sketchbook of great artists.   The thing is, the paper is terrible. All the 'bloggers and geeks I've heard raving about these notebooks use them for their laundry lists or their ideas to write about or God knows what. And while I'm not the best artist around, I did minor in fine arts in school, so I'm not completely clueless. So take my word (or don't; it's your loss); the paper is just plain bad.   Most drawing paper has some degree of "tooth"--the roughness of the paper, which rubs off your graphite or charcoal smoothly onto the page. The tooth on these sketchbooks is nonexistent. Rather than describe in more detail the paper, however, I believe I can give an apt description in two words.   Manila folder. That's what the paper in these books is like, so as to be nearly indistinguishable (slightly smoother, in fact, than manila folders--even less tooth). While paper quality is something of a personal preference, I've never seen anyone use any paper remotely similar to this for drawing, so I have to question the claim that these pads are identical to those used by Picasso et al.   On a positive note, the binding is great, the covers are great, and the elastic strap, bookmark ribbon, and back pocket are all great features. But when it comes down to it, I care most about the paper quality. If you want to just write, get one of these. If you intend to do any serious drawing, don't bother. 
 Although the "technical data" said this pot is safe for the stovetop, when it arrived, its own literature said very clearly that it is NOT safe for stovetop use. The only reason I ordered it was because I wanted something I could move from stovetop to oven or broiler. THis is very disappointing 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 The only reason I finished "The Transit of Venus" was the hope of any improvement.  This book took away two hours of my life-two hours that I can never earn back by reading true literature.  The story (is there a story?) is dreadful.  The sentence structures, the paragraph performances, the offered descriptions assist in one wondering if Ms. Hazzard is merely attempting to impress the audience with her self-perceived insights.  I will never recommend this book to any audience.  Ms. Hazzard and her publisher should refund my money 
 I was impressed with the reviews given for this title, both quantity and quality (lots of five stars). Then I dug a little deeper into each review and realized that 95% of them are people who "coincidentally" only reviewed one title (How To Get Ideas) or were named "A reader" (which are easy to manufacture reviews for in bulk and fluff up any books rating using Anonymizer or using a different computer for each review to get around Amazon's controls). There are a few reviewers that actually reviewed one other title. There are even a very few who actually reviewed several other titles but some of them could be friends or industry buddies who were persuaded to do an online review (or, to be fair, even legit reviewers). I'm not saying this is a bad book, and I could be wrong about my suspicions, but such "coincidences" damaged credibility the author had built up with me and have caused me to cross this title off my list of potential future purchases. I was sceptical about an earlier reviewers scepticism about the glowing reviews for this book but a deeper look caused me to also be suspicious.   
 It seems that other than a song or two, Fall Out Boy forgot their guitar's.  Very disappointing and slow paced 
 This is seriously the worst movie ever.  The last time I saw it was in the theater, and I still can't get over how bad it was.  In fact, it ruined a perfectly good date with a perfectly good guy.... We didn't speak for six months after we saw it together!  I too wish I could give it no stars.... And obviously people aren't looking for this movie since the last review was in 2002!  I can't believe you can even buy it on DVD 
 Who knows why Ruelle felt compelled to write this book?  He makes a lot of sweeping statements about fields he doesn't have a mastery over.  Only  tangentially does he bring in chaos, and he doesn't bother staying on any  point long enough to add any insight on any of the issues presented.  It's  such a weak book that it doesn't even have "brainstorming value"  -- the collection of ideas is limited in breadth and depth.  Perhaps in  1991 it was fashionable to come up with books like this; having read it in  1999, I found little of value 
 "Performance Scorecards" describes the process by which a fictional large company studies and then improves their system of performance measurement. The company already collects dozens of measurements, so the key challenge is to identify the most important and coordinate the process between departments and up and down the corporate ladder. The hero of this process is "Bob" a consultant who acts as facilitator. After reading this book I think most senior managers would be reluctant to tackle the process without a consultant like Bob. The authors are consultants and I would guess that they wrote this book mainly as a way to get new business.  As president of a company with just 17 employees, I was hoping for something simpler and more concrete. I need a list of useful performance indicators, with tips on how to measure them. This book didn't offer that.  I cannot recommend the book for a small organization. I give the book two stars, instead of one star, because it could be useful to a senior manager in a large company who is contemplating hiring a consultant to help overhaul the company's performance measurement system. The authors might be just the consultants you need. 
 I think Dr Oz is a fantastic doctor and I have heard him speak on tv but I did not find any useful information in this book for my life 
 I was also disappointed with the quality and contents of this book.  The pictures, samples and description not up to the usual standard of this author.  Although a nice book to look at, I have not been inspired to rush right in and make any of the cards discussed. Pity ... 
 Ridiculous, laughable! Written by a patriarchial mentality. If a man wants to know what a woman thinks or wants, then a man must ask a woman. No man understands women! The only woman who could be 'explained' by this nonsense is one who's been brainwashed by patriarchial idelolgy, and there are quite a few of that type in America (and in Saudi Arabia, and in Afghanistan, and ....).   For a book that does explain women, to both women and men, see Simon de Beauvoir's 'The Second Sex'. Excellent text, I've read and reread it many times, with greeat benefit. 
 This book is a quick read, though obviously there is more there. How much, exactly, remains in question. Apparently, others have seen more there than I did, but I think this is one of those books that reflects back at you what you are looking for in it. If one wants to find deep meaning or spirituality, one will find it -- extracting meaning from each picture, each word, each pause. But, I don't know. I found 'The Alchemist' to be much more successful in doing a similar thing. I would recommend that one instead.. 
 Noam Chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his, yours, and mine - the United States of America.  He has made millions of dollars teaching, lecturing, selling his books, and investing.  His world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is well-deserved.  His infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own Jewish ethnicity and the U.S., in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the United States.  He has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of American foreign policy.  He goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism, when he always ranks the U.S. and Israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now, and even in history.  His distrust of any authority, benign or otherwise, is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the "underdog," even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as Al Queda or Hezbollah.    Yet since 1955, hypocrite Chomsky has worked for the "overdog" Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of War and mass destruction, and continues to this very day.  Chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the United States and the Jewish State.  If he were not so attached to the freedom of making money, earning the adulation of the American Left, and freedom to express himself, he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in North Korea, Iran, or Syria.  Let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much, the United States of America.    God Bless America, which will continue to give Chomsky the right to speak, teach, and make lots of money.  Raybo 
 I was aghast that the authors, Knight and Lomas, would embarrass themselves and write such idiocracy. Their conclusions on the secret rites in Freemasonry was all based on assumptions, not historical fact. They twisted scripture and historical dates to fit their insane theories, and as they did so made the Jewish race out to be the big bad enemy and the Egyptians out to be the great heroes. The book shows just how racist the authors are against the Jews, which only makes me think that the entire Freemason's order (based on Egyptian rituals) probably are racist too. 
 Seeking enlightenment?  Seek somewhere else?  This "update" to the classic is a classic waste of time.  Unlike the original, you will give it to your library to write it off on your taxes 
 Here I thought I had the perfect book for my upcoming journey from Boca Raton to Sarasota via I-75.  It arrives today and I search the pages for I-75 in Florida.  What a downer! I can't understand why the author did not complete his work for the entire distance of I-75, instead of ending it at the Florida-Georgia border. Perhaps he ran out of gas. No matter - Tomorrow I'm returing this book to Amazon 
 I read a book called The Whipping Boy. It  was not very good.  This story is about a prince who has a few problems. He is always gets in to trouble. Since the prince can never get hit, they have a whipping boy to get hit for him. The whipping boy gets hit about three to four times a day. The whipping boy's name is Jemmy. The prince's name is Brat. Jemmy and Prince Brat run away and get into a lot of trouble.  It was vary confusing and hard to keep up with. My mind was drifting around. I would give this book a 1 out of 5 because it was not very good. It was kind of stupid.  The only way you would be able to like this book is if you like stupid books. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It seems like a good book from the cover. The first few chapters are good. But then it gets really boring. After every chapter it got really confusing 
  Before you buy into the hype and purchase an item you'll eventually discard (if you love your dog, that is) you should know that dogs hate this device. It feels totally unnatural to them. Its so-called "scientific" design is based on the way a supposed alpha wolf enforces his authority by aggressively gripping a subordinate around the muzzle with his teeth. (Nice, huh?) Since we now know that the alpha theory is false, the rationale behind this torture device for dogs is equally bogus. (Wild wolf packs do not form dominance hierarchies or spend time trying to show each other who's boss by grabbing each other around the snout; such behaviors are only produced when wolves are forced to form unnatural packs while living in captivity.) A device that mimics a totally unnatural act of aggression cannot be considered positive.   As a dog trainer, and just as a human being who loves dogs and hates to see them being mistreated, I cannot stress strongly enough that this device should not be used on any dog, ever.   So what do you do to keep your dog from pulling? Dogs don't really pull on the leash so much as they get pulled on by things in the environment that stimulate and attract their instincts. So the trick to training a dog NOT to pull is to play games that will make YOU more interesting and more appealing to his instincts than the things in the environment are.  
 This book was written for people who truly have no clue how to act in any kind of professional setting.  I was already aware that I should not use "quick and dirty" or "snafu" in a professional environment.  It was a waste of money 
 This refers to the 2nd edition, 6th printing.  I had the 2nd edition, 3rd printing of this book from our library and was quite happy with it -- see the other reviews about the quality of the content.  So I decided to buy it... however what I received was the 2nd edition, 6th printing, for which the term "printing" is not quite appropriate. It looks like if you had run the 3rd printing through a scanner and then printed it using your favourite bubble jet printer. What was gray in the 3rd printing appears as black, there are stripes in black areas, and thin lines in the drawings tend to disappear. Moreover, all the text characters have black speckles around it and white speckles inside the characters. This is not only at some pages, but throughout the entire book.  So if you intend to buy it, have a look at the figure on page 1, and judge for yourself if you are happy with the printing 
 Each and every one of these films certainly deserves a five star rating, however, for all you owners of multi-disc DVD changers, you're going to be sadly disappointed when you try and program your machines for an evening of entertainment.  All five of the discs will not play in the program and/or repeat mode.  At least that's the case with both of my 5 disc Sony players.  I've had this problem arise with a few other, mostly inexpensive off brand discs, but this is the first time I've run across this issue with a Warner Brothers product and I'm very upset to say the least.  The WB needs to re-evaluate their quality control 
 Please, do not waste your time on this product. It is the biggest waste of money. I bought it after using professional potter's wheel in the studio I worked at, and did not expect for this toy to compare to the wheel's at the studio, so I was suprised at the speed the wheel went at with nothing on it, and with 2lbs on it. But the very minute I put the slightest pressure on the wheel to attempt to center the clay, the wheel came to complete stop. I tried for another hour with less and less clay, and the result was always the same. This is a complete gimmick and not worth a moment of your time 
 I loved the music in the movie and was disappointed that the CD had sound bites from the movie over the music.  I really just wanted to enjoy the songs.  I'm going to have to individually download the songs to get it without parts of the movie included 
 These are small, light and comfortable.  That's the good part.  They also sound very tinny and thin.  Very little bass.  I've put them away and chalked them up as a total loss.  I'm using my old phones.  They're a bit bigger and heavier, but they sound much better.  If you like flat frequency response, look elsewhere.  If you're only listening to voice, these might be just fine 
 The book promises a cure, but gives one man's story of how he helped his son, it leaves you wondering, "where's the beef?" It's like an informercial claiming, "read on," and you do, and you keep passing more signs reading "read on." Chris's story is heart warming, but sounds a lot like a million little pieces, and we all know how much of that turned out to be true... 
 As a single 30-something man, I bought this book out of a sense of curiosity.   Popular culture scolds men when we become too demanding. A man who will only look at women who are ten years younger, rail-thin, and blonde is quickly dismissed as superficial. However, the women that Ms. Whitehead describes are only interested in tall, handsome, alpha males who make $100,000 per year. And they want to land them at age 35.   I am 35 myself, and I would love to meet a Britney Spears lookalike who is intelligent, makes lots of money, and (very important) is also interested in me. I would also like to win the lottery, have as much hair as I had when I was twenty, and go golfing five days per week. But that's not life on earth.   Perhaps Ms. Whitehead could write a sequel: "There are Plenty of Good Men Left, but You're too Vain to Notice Them."  Most 30ish single men I know have long since realized that no woman "has it all"--and if she does, she's probably married. I suggest that Ms. Whitehead's women take a reality check, lighten up, and go talk to the short bald guy who is smiling at them from the other side of the room. 
 This is definitely not a book for those who really wants to learn mass transfer and unit operations. The author only skims through the important concepts and the examples are either over simplified or irrelevant. The example questions are full of mistakes and the answers provided are wrong. For the studious chemical engineering student who is interested to understand the important concepts of mass transfer, stay away from this book. This book totally mess me up. Now I am using Transport Processes by Geankoplis, which is in my opinion, more direct and conventional, and easy to understand than Cussler, who writes the textbook like a story book!! The Mass Transfer section in the book Transport Phenomena  by Bird also do better justice to this subject even though it is more suited for graduate students. My advice: Don't use this book if you want to grasp unit operations well 
 I PURCHASED THE SANDISK 1GB FROM EEK TECHNOLOGY FOR MY CANON POWERSHOT A510. THE PACKAGE ARRIVED PROMPTLY AFTER BEING CHARGED $12.00 FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING WHEN THE ACTUAL COST OF POSTAGE WAS ONLY .67 CENTS. MY COMPLAINT BROUGHT A REFUND OF ONLY 4.00, LEAVING THE COMPANY A WHOPPING $8.00 TO STICK THE ITEM IN A BUBBLE ENVELOPE AND SHIP IT.....A VERY NICE PROFIT. NOW THE REALLY BAD NEWS......THE CARD SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK. I FORMATTED IT, TRIED IT IN FRIENDS CAMERAS AND DID EVERY THING IMAGINABLE BUT TO NO AVAIL. WHEN I CONTACTED EEK THEY REPLIED THAT THE 30 DAY RETURN PERIOD HAD EXPIRED ( ONLY BY HOURS DEPENDING ON WHEN THE PERIOD BEGINS ) AND THAT I NOW HAD TO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH SANDISK. THIS IS NO WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS AND I WOULD CAUTION OTHERS WHO SENSE A "GOOD BUY" TO REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING " YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR". GLENN IN NOVA SCOTI 
 Ehring's book is an interesting attempt (in part) to solve the question of what allows ordinary objects to persist through time. He defends a "causal trope" account to this end. His development criticizes (amongst others) the views of Donald Davidson on events, and does not do adequate justice to exploring them for his purposes. His references to this part of the metaphysics literature are woefully underdeveloped. The issues he raises are important and interesting, but appear to be muddled. Like much metaphysics these days, it fails to do much contact with science and technology which would (if done well) no doubt improve its content 
 I'm so disappointed with this calendar.   For years my best friend and I exchanged the Out on the Porch Calendar.   we enjoyed the literary quotes (we both love books and someday will open our own little bookstore), we loved the beautiful porches where we would picture ourselves sitting and chatting and enjoying each other's company (we live far away from each other at this point).    This new re-design is terrible!    The photos are so so but not like before.    We are searching for another calendar for our next year's hopes and imaginations.    Very very disappointed 
 Pop music ought to be easy to consume, emotionally empathetic, and harmonious. None of the hooks, melodies, or harmonies on this album are particularly good. The songs themselves lack feeling, coming across as overtly manufactured and contrived.  He sounds fantastic, but this is the wrong way to start a solo career 
 I bought this cookbook before looking at the Atkins Web site. Big mistake. You can find these recipes, and in some cases updates of them, for free on the Web site. You can also find lots of low-carb recipes by searching with Google. This book also could have used the assistance of an experienced cookbook editor 
 Racer takes on a rookie. Wow. We've never seen that before, have we? The worst thing about this movie are the race scenes, many of which resemble a video game. I'd rather watch ABC Sports' "To Live and Drive the Indy 500." That's more realistic AND much more fun 
 The Nevada Trivia Book by Richard Moreno is another trivia book devoted to  fascinating facts about Nevada. It differs from the Bouton book by offering  more indepth answers to the trivia questions and includes substantially  more historical information. I would highly recommend it for anyone  interested in Nevada 
 I was quite disappointed by "Sassanian Elite Cavalry". It did not seem to be up the normal standard of excellency of Osprey's books. The color plates by Angus McBride did not look as polished or as detailed as the usual works by this artist (especially plate E : it ressembles a sketch more than a finished painting).  Moreover, some of the plates' descriptions do not quite match the paintings (for example D5 and D6 :  the description talks about a quiver and a sword not visible on the plate).  The text suffered from the lack of a good and much-needed map of the Sassanian Empire, and a glossary of Persian technical words (for instance plate A caption talks about  a "sardar" without an explanation anywhere in the text). The plates show five women, including at least two warriors, and readers may have liked to know more about the place of women in the Sassanian society and army.  Also, the black and white illustrations do not well support the text. One exemple : the author speaks several times about the similarities between Sassanian costumes and certain modern Iranian traditional clothes. A few pictures of the later would be of more help to the reader than too many, slightly blurry, photos of stone carvings. I also wonder why there is only height color plates in this Elite series book instead of the usual twelve 
 These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply 
 Okay, you may think that I do not appreciate the so-called classics, but I have to be honest--I simply cannot stand this book. The language is so bad, and even the ending is horrible. The only good thing I can say about the whole thing is that it's very short. It's only a few chapters long, and that's it.   I read this book with my English class in high school, and reading it once was more than enough for me. Not to diss John Steinbeck or anything like that, but this book is one of the worst books in all of literature. I don't even understand why they call this lame piece of work a "classic". 
 David Schiller may think that there are a million ways to God but God sais there is only one. I wonder what the use of Jesus sacrifice was if one can enter heaven through Allah or Buddah. None.And that is because there is no other way to eternal life exept through Jesus Christ. This book can only lead a person away from the truth and into deception. Jesus died to take our sins away so that we can come clean before God and so that when God sees us He will see Jesus in us, thus giving us the right to enter heaven without blemish. Believe in Jesus and you shall be saved. God bless you 
 The first reviewer of this book is an obvious moron when it comes to the history of the War Between the States. The north did not attack the south because of slavery. Lincoln did not even mention slavery till the Gettysburg Address in 1863! It was fought over money, power and control....to save New Englands economic !*#! If you want to read a book about the causes of the war read "When In The Course Of Human Events" by Charles Adams 
 They keep saying that the American public is not stupid, yet they seem to be buying these books. And if this spewing of hatred is not godless, I don't know what is. 
 Dr. Lee is not an OB/Gyn.  be careful when reading this book.  Recend clinical studies are not included in this book.     Furthermore, Dr. Lee is widely disregarded by his peers 
 If you need to buy the book because the author is your instructor,then do so.  If you want to learn how to make sound, prudent decisions as a firefighter, purchase John Norman's "Fire Officer's Handbook."  The difference between the two is like reading Dr. Suess and Shakespeare 
 A friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday after someone else recommended it to her. We decided to read it with a group of friends, so then we could all see what it was about. Having just finished the book, I can say that I really did not enjoy reading it and had to force myself to finish it. The mix of Spanish and English may appeal to some, but to a non-Spanish speaker, it was more of a hindrance. The plot goes way off the deep end, and before there is any real character or plot development, the reader is suddenly overwhelmed with a major event, just a few pages into the book. Various details included in the story seemed rather useless and excessive, being tossed in and never brought up again, at least not in a major way. For example, the interruption of the plot to discuss the lesbian couple from Oakland was not much than that, just an interruption. The effect of these characters was so subtle that a few of my reading group friends didn't quite understand the reason for its inclusion in the book. In this example, the author seemed to lack the ability to tie it into the overall plot, merely hinting at the ramifications. However, actually bringing these minor details into the book may have been even worse, only because the book would have been longer then! If you're considering reading this "novel", I'd suggest you find a better, more well-written book to spend your time with instead 
 If Disney ever wanted to make the argument that they have not lost touch with their childhood roots, I would strongly suggest not mentioning Snow Dogs in that argument.  Sure, the numbers showed that this film was a success (i.e. the budget was $35 million and it took in $81 million in the US alone), but the final product that was released to the screen was nothing but sheer drivel.  From the unoriginal story, to the inconsistent characters, to the painful acting of Cuba Gooding, Jr., Snow Dogs proved two truths.  The first is that Disney can successfully make and mass-produce B-level cinema.  The second is that they can make Oscar-winning actors give the worst performances of their careers.  Snow Dogs demonstrates fully that some people in Hollywood choose money over scripts, they choose flimsy over developed, and recycled over original.  What upset me the most about this film was the use of CGI to exaggerate the dog's expressions.  To me, that is a huge slap in Cuba Gooding, Jr's face.  If the studio didn't think that Cuba could successfully make the audiences laugh, then they needed to get stronger talent, do not muddle the genre with CGI created eyes, mouths, and expressions on the dogs.  With this CGI, I felt as if I was watching a quick fix to an already unfixable problem.  Did I go into this film expecting greatness?  Not in any way shape or form.  What I did expect was a level of professionalism topped with some brilliant "something" to make me utterly aware that this was a Disney film and while they may have a bad film on their hands, at least they may throw money to fix the problem.  Again, my expectations were demolished.  It became very obvious as I watched this film that half of the scenes were in front of a green screen, not actually in Alaska.  Some of the more emotional moments were completely ruined by the horrid special effects in place.  Disney has the money, where did the $35 million dollar budget go?  From the CGI created dog "faces" to the CGI trees, bears, and mountains, you never felt like you were in Alaska at all, but instead warmly comfortable inside an obvious soundstage.  Pay up Disney, you cheated me on this one...  For this to be a full review, I have to mention the acting.  It pains me to do so because nobody, I repeat, NOBODY could muster any form of "reality" to this film.  From the delivery of the lines, the horrid physical comedy (which never worked), to the random moment of romance, not one character in this movie stayed in character or gave us any semblance of an actual character.  I watched an hour and a half of actors awkwardly demonstrating to us that they did not know their characters, that they did not know their lines, and that the paycheck at the end was more important than the work throughout the process.  I place solely the blame on Cuba Gooding, Jr.  What happened to him?  From the opening scene in Miami to the ending embarrassing "catch-phrase", I felt like Cuba should have handed the Academy back the award and apologized to everyone profusely.  There are lines in Snow Dogs that were obviously read from a cue card.  There were moments when it was obvious Cuba didn't care.  He showed no range of emotion, no rational credibility, and again, there was no character.  Who was Cuba Gooding, Jr. in this film?  Just like a Tootsie Roll Pop, the world may never know!  I could easily, and sadly, say the same about James Coburn.  He was awarded an Oscar as well and the best he can manage is Snow Dogs?  Who was Thunder Jack?  What was his story, what made him gruff, what ... what ... what ... just too many questions running through my mind with these key actors that it makes me feel sorry for the child audience this film was aimed towards.  It was very clear that neither of these actors were passionate about the story for they would have stopped early and backed away.  I would have thought that Cuba (or at least James Coburn) would have put their hands down when it was discovered that SISQO (Mr. Thong himself) was going to be a key player.  Unbelievable is the level of lacking respect that both of these actors had for themselves.  The proof is in Snow Dogs.  What bothered me the most about this film was the lack of intelligence aimed towards children.  This was a "family" film, yet racism seemed to be slapped directly in your face.  There was a scene that sticks out in my mind when Gooding tries to find his real father and assumes that it can only be the other black man in town.  When it is discovered that it is someone else, there is a shock in the community.  This film was released in 2002, with the society that we live in why would this be such a shock to the system?  Couple this with the fact that Michael Bolton brings us the "inspirational" line from the film, "It doesn't matter what color you are, everyone can have soul."  Egh.  Where did this come from, and is this a "good" message to send to children?  This ranks right next to the feeling that Gooding's love-interest was the only woman within a 100-mile radius, and that those living in Alaska are grizzly men with bad teeth.  I felt midway through this film that Disney executives were in their offices insisting on another Cool Runnings-esque film (there was even a Volkswagen moment in this one).  Sadly, with Snow Dogs their request became a nightmare.  Overall, this was a cheap film, which boasts Oscar-winners performing well below the bar, CGI dogs and background, a story that hinges on the edge of fantasy, and the quintessential Disney "bow of approval".  What I mean by this is that anything can happen, and with Disney films, it will.  Gooding has the finances to leave his dental practice for several weeks without worrying about missing work, he can learn how to dogsled within a couple days, saves a man's life, and he immediately falls in love with the only girl from town who happens to be a model in her spare time.  For those looking for a cute and cuddly film about dogs, I would not suggest this garbage.  It is predictable, pretentious, and pathetic.  Maybe a six-year old wouldn't mind the three "p", but this critic hated it!  Grade: * out of **** 
 If you are expecting tons of pictures of different brochure design, you will love this book. I was expecting a "how to" book brochure design 
 i'm very dissapointed with this book. The whole story idea sounds fascinating, but. you see the book opens out with the point of view of Patsy, the oldest child in Patrick Henry's family. You really build a bond with her, when she crys you cry for her as well. Then her part abruptly ends and goes on to her sister Anne. Anne goes on and on about how evil Patsy is and she turns the readers against Patsy. So by the end of the book you hate Patsy but you also hate Anne for turning your image of Patsy to a bad one. The story itself ends tragicly as well. I total this is a book where nothing good seems to happen to break up the bad parts. i give it two stars for the Patsy part but overall i don't reccomend this book. i'm dissapointed also because there was hardly any mention to historical events and life. This book will leave you feelin crummy. don't read it 
 This never should've been pressed.  They should've taken the mix and thrown it out.  DO NOT BUY!! 
 This is a moral relativist/post-modern/revisionist and (therefore necessarily) stridently anti-Christian tome. So undoubtably, some of you will enjoy it.  Ms. Lepore wrote this book primarily to add her singular invective onto the mountain of slanderous and false accusations already accumulated about the people who settled and built this country. (And I thought post-modernist were supposed to be nonjudgmental?)  A sample of the revisionist history Ms. Lepore regales us with is her assertion that torture (of the most hideous and unspeakable nature, well described in this book), practiced by the Indians against English settlers in King Phillips War, was really just as an expression of cultural norms in the Indian "community" and therefore not "wrong" in any absolute sense. Nevertheless Ms. Lepore is in high dudgeon when she describes one occasion when white settlers set fire to an Indian village and slaughtered women and children fleeing the flames.   Actually, the main value I obtained from this book was seeing in "vivid color", so-to-speak, just how bloody the Indian warfare really was. I'm no advocate of massacre, or genocide, but when you read this book it doesn't take a lot of imagination to figure out why "the white man" became so determined to exterminate the Indian. If one day you find yourself enjoying a pipe by the family hearth, with your family all around, and the next you find your home and barn burned to the ground, as well as the raped and mutilated remains of your loved ones scattered about the countryside, I think you might "evolve" some passionate feelings too.  
 I must be the only one who didn't like this book.  I felt it was written in a one-tone, endless stream of the bad events and bad people in her life.  Not one good thing or good person.  Didn't pack any emotional wallop because she didn't seem to react to the bad things that happened to her.  Now maybe she had to be that way in order to survive, but it didn't make for interesting reading.  It was hard to sympathize with her because she had no reaction herself to all these traumas.  It's unbelievable that she and her sister turned out as well as they did, but I found myself not caring about them and therefore, not caring about this book 
 Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books).  It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events.  The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books).  The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: "HUH??" This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read.  It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and "Forget about it" 
 I was put off at the outset when the author described "B" (I think the bird deserves a name) as resembling a scrotum with a beak. I have to agree totally with Crenshaw right down the line. I have a good vocabulary, but this was too lofty for me. The author seemed full of himself. I also did the two chapters, then the roulette, finding more of the same. I couldn't care less about Chris Chester and his belly-dancing wife, nor do I care about his descriptions of life with the bird as it affects him. Ditto, Jack. 
 As a " molest survivor" I found this book offensive in it's disregard of Duncan's molestation of Daisy. I could not understand Mark's not telling Eva; reporting Duncan to the police nor could I understand why He,in a sense, protected Duncan by keeping "the secret". I am disappointed in Miller's handling of this subject and that she seems to downplay the evisceration of the soul this type of abuse can have on a young person. 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 	In Lynn Margulis' Symbiotic Planet (A New Look at Evolution), the reader is presented with the author's ideas and theories on evolution in a style that entwines an autobiographical basis into her piece of work as well. 	The use of first person throughout the novel personalizes the conversation that the book presents to the reader. Margulis, although only presenting a theory is very unsure and unconfident with her own opinions. She seems to be uncomfortable with presenting her thoughts straight out, and barely attempts to persuade the reader to believe in her theories. When she presents her theories with a very minute attempt to persuade her audience, the book and her ideas become nearly pointless, and bland - for the lack of evidence used to back up the thoughts of the reader. 	The book switches back and forth between informational and autobiographical. In the beginning of the book, the small stories the Margulis includes on her history and self-experiences intrigue the reader by adding the attraction that accompanies a story. Yet Margulis takes the story parts of her book too far, and soon her autobiographical accounts become outdated, losing all former interest. Margulis gets caught up in her own life, rather than her theories on life. The stories of the courses she took in college qualify her ability in the subject matter, yet they do nothing to further the purpose and goal of the book. This book comes across as being a book that was written by an author more interested in herself than her theories she was presenting. Only halfway through the book is any relevant information exposed, and even as the reader reaches this point, it quickly rotates back to an autobiographical account on Lynn Margulis.  	Margulis presents her readers with fascinating topics that she is well qualified to discuss and propose theories on, yet she fails to effectively present the information. This book would only be of interest to avid fans of Lynn Margulis who wish to learn more on her background, and who thoroughly appreciate her style of writing. Otherwise, Lynn Margulis' Symbiotic Planet (A New Look at Evolution) is not the book for you. 
 As someone involved in the consulting area for many years, I was unable to find any new idea that would make worthwhile to spend money in this book. Almost everything that is mentioned here can be grabbed from free articles availables in Internet,about this subject. Additionally, there are a good number of books that will help you much more to plan and implement ERP's. Last, but not least, the book only have a handful of small pictures and tables. Unacceptable for a modern book about business and technology topics 
 Recently bought a spindle of a 50 pack of Sony DVD+R and all had errors.  I noticed other reviewers are using DVD Identifier to see the real manufacture of black disks.  I downloaded DVD Identifier and scanned a Sony DVD+R 16x and what came up was (Sony Recording Media Co.)  These blank disks are terrible, all the disks had errors and half way through the burn process would produce errors, stay away from these blank disks.  I recommend Fuji disks whick scanned through DVD Identifier is (Taiyo Yuden Co. Ltd.) and burn excellent and Verbatim disks whick scanned through DVD Identifier is (Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.) and these too burn excellently.  Hope all this helps 
 I recently bought 2 Bikini Touch shavers. Both shavers were defective. The warantee is 30 days only - from the day of purchase. My product was delayed in the mail, so by the time I opened the package and found the defective product, 30 days have already passed. The manufacturer had absolutely no interest. So be warned - if the product fails after 30 days, it is tough luck 
 I had a difficult time with this book. Having ready "Flags of Our Fathers", I had hopes this would be as well written and informitive. However, from early on this book came across as just another piece of "pagan liberal propoganda". The ethnic cleansing of American Indians by the United States was an early warmup of typical pagan propoganda and it headed downhill from there. The pagans liberals have a prospensity to always color whatever the United States does in the worst light and make the atrocities of our enemies to be minor indiscretions. This book is another pagan apologetic for what's wrong with the US and right with all nations who wish us ill. 
 THE BEGINING WAS VERY AMUSING BUT AS IT GETS ON I JUST DON'T FEEL THE ROMANCE ANYMORE. THE SEX IS PRETTY MUCH CONSTANT BUT THE HEROINE'S CHARACTER WAS WAY TOO CHILDISH. SHE DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE UNTIL THE END OF THE BOOK. SHE'S NOT VERY EXCITING OR UNDERSTANDING LIKE THE OTHER FEMALE IN DARA JOY'S OTHER BOOK. THE GIRL JUST LEFT ME COLD AND SORRY FOR THE GUY. WELL, THE GUY IS VERY SWEET AND TRIED TO WOO HER FROM THE BEGINING TO THE END. AT FIRST IT WAS JUST A CHALLENGE TO HIM BUT THEN IT BECOMES A LOVE CHASE. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CUTE. ALTHOUGH HE'S A GREAT CHARACTER, THE ONGOING OF HIS MASCULINITY IS VERY ANNOYING IN THE HEROINE'S POINT OF VIEW. IT MAKES ME THINK SHE'S LUSTING AFTER HIM. BUT ANYWAY, I FIRST I ENJOYED THE BOOK BUT STILL IT LEFT ME UNCERTAIN OF THEIR FUTURE TOGETHER. IF IT WAS ANY OTHER HEROINE, THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE PULL IT OFF EASILY 
 One word: garbage. This stuff reminds me of a spoof Will Ferrell did on Saturday Night Live a while back about some lame singer (Robert Goulet). Same voice here for this so-called singer except it apparently was not intended as a joke. I'd rather listen to the screeching sound of nails on a chalk board than this, thank you.. 
 Do a search on the true story.  Find out what really happened and how her "therapist" actually created and named the personalities.  Also, you will discover that this author KNEW the TRUTH about this case and simply hid it away in an effort to sell more books 
 My review is basically a review of the reviewers. In particular I am going to pick on the reviewer who wrote "A substantial and objective view of a Latin American Legend..." February 9, 2004, Matthew Dubuque. Because of that review I decided not to buy the book. (I haven't read it but based on the reviews I've changed my mind about purchasing it). Most reviews listed here whether critical of Castro or critical of his deriders, have really missed the point. It's all about ignorance.   Centralized Power What many fail to see is the problem of centralized power found exclusively in the hands of the State. How many times have we heard about how even if Hitler was bad, he had the trains running on time and brought back an economy from the ruins? God forbid something good should happen in a person's life and the government doesn't get credit for it. The friends of Liberty are few indeed. Cuba, at least in our Hemisphere is an example of centralized power destroying life and lying about its success even if it is successfully argued that the individual should take a back seat to the communal good.   Politicians If in fact a "conservative" "appointee of Margaret Thatcher" wrote this book it betrays that even the Hawks like the right in the UK and US are way off when it comes to Cuba. If it was "written by an appointee of the free-market heroine Margaret Thatcher" that gives credence to the view that there isn't much difference between political conservatives and modern political liberals: they go about arguing for different roles government should have in a person's life but they both want government in a person's life. They aren't too far from the likes of Castro.  Castro and Latin America To say Castro is deserving of praise like that given to Simon Bolivar shows how much ignorance there is of Latin America in the United States. The common view here is that all Latin Americans are either lazy, deserve their governments, come from naturally corrupt countries, and can only be saved by the strong man. It is interesting that those who hold similar views in the States don't prescribe such a government in their own hometowns- different rules for special people, I guess.  Further proof of the mass ignorance in the States about Cuba in particular is seen in the reviewer's statement: "Coming from a decisively Thatcherite background, the author's commentary is neither distorted by the hysterical whiners in Miami nor is it merely pinko propaganda." I can assure you that the Miami whiners are anything but: many have recreated their lives as Americans never to return to Cuba (without any major complaint), never involving themselves in politics or in some cases holding very liberal and pro-government views. Those who have complained and taken action (such as attempting to overthrow the Castro regime) the US has dealt with forcefully. Many of those active whiners now serve life terms in Federal prison for their actions (so much for the US's claim that it fights for the freedom of the oppressed worldwide).  The other more peaceful "whiners" in Miami have reasons to protest. Their family members have been: shot by firing squad, drowned by Cuban coast guard, attacked by US coast guard, tortured in Castro's prisons, divided by both the US and Cuban governments, and so on.  Another point of ignorance is the claim that Fidel lost many of his men by massacre during the revolution. This is not the case. The real major bloodletting took place once Castro came to power. Typical of all tyrants, he purged many of his own clan accusing them of conspiring against the revolution (challenging his power, reasoning and/or techniques). Plus, the vast majority of Cuba had no idea who Fidel Castro was. Castro merely appeared stage left, made his entrance and delivered the speeches. The "revolution" against Batista and Cuba's past was largely an action of the political class (those already in power) which of course Castro was not a part of.   Literacy  Literacy rates never are guaranteed by the government. In Cuba there is no way to cross examine the claims of government as the press does in a free society- such as questioning the claims of a government that states another country had a weapons of mass destruction. Just look at the US. Its literacy rates were highest in the world up until after the Civil War. Decade after decade its own government has kept records showing that the more government involves itself in the education of its citizens (increased spending) the greater the illiteracy (at least since the 1950s). Most students here today cannot even point out their country on a map and know very little about economics (a greater reason for their willingness to depend on government and hate the rich).   Blockade? The blockade is another point of contention. The word blockade first of all is a malapropism. There are no war ships blocking the ports of Havana. The embargo against Cuba is a joke. The first supporter of Cuba is Washington. The relationship between Havana and Washington is more that of two former lovers who criticize (directly and indirectly) one another's current lifestyles and actions- calling each other names but also ready to stop the actions of outsiders to the relationship lest it create the impression that the outsider has a stake in the former lovers' relationship- than the relationship of two archenemies. If you don't believe me, take a look at Washington's willingness for regime changes all over the world, its reluctance to take action against Cuba or allow others (the outsiders of the relationship) to take that action and its cozy relationship with Cuban military along Guantanamo base/border.  Prenatal Care, medicine, and homelessness If a mother misses a visit to her doctor in Cuba I wouldn't doubt the doctor visits the mother the next day. Undoubtedly since the State is ever present in such a system in every person's life, either the doctor or the mother have a political role in that relationship. And if either fails the State (list Castro here) the State will most assuredly fail them in respective their natural liberty (prison awaits). I doubt that mother would care about doc's visit knowing that the visiting doctor lacks supplies. (I know, its Castro's fault or the embargo's fault. Why can't it be the people's fault? When will they rebel?) This is nonetheless the case even in the US. Soon we will see our dear friend the Nanny Government knocking on the doors of all poor neighborhoods making sure that mothers get their prenatal care they deservedly need for the nurturing of future robots (I'm sorry, I meant to say patriotic citizens). Keep in mind that the medical doctor in the US is in fact an agent of the government. Try getting some medicines you need without a prescription. Said medicines are approved by the government, tested by the government and monitored by the government.   I am also certain that in Cuba there are no homeless because, well, there are no homes to be homeless from. Take a look at photos today of Havana and you'll see why some Cubans might want to be homeless than to live under the roof of a soon to be condemned structure.   After reading this book and writing all the things Dubuque wrote it is hard to believe that one can honestly state that the book is a "balanced examination...".. The reviewer also goes on to say that he goes to the island twice yearly on licensed visits. (Governments love to help one another regardless of their official declarations concerning one another.) The reviewer explicitly states how government supports his trips to Cuba which in turn create his view of Cuba. He states that his visits are "fully authorized", no doubt, with the Treasury department's rubber stamp, Havana's offering of tourist traps and his safe flight back to the US, causing his rose colored lenses to sit firmly on the bridge of his nose as he tells us what he has seen in Cuba 
 As a layman, the book is easy to read and offers some nice historical facts.  However, the one page synopses of various styles seem to be too brief to offer any kind of detailed analysis of what a particular style has  to offer.  The book probably should have been longer.  In addition, we  learn much more about what Baker does not like rather than what he likes.   The references to classical architecture, including the diagrams, lack  clarity.  The book may be a good starting point to learn about American  residential architecture, but it is by no means a Bible 
 When purchasing audiobooks, I normally follow a simple but very effective rule: never, never, never buy an audiobook read by the author. Even if the author is a talented writer, he/she is invariably a terrible narrator. Always look for audiobooks performed by experienced readers, as in Bryson's own "Notes From a Small Island" and "A Walk in the Woods", read by Ron Mclarty.  In Bryson's case I made a rare exception when I listened to "In a Sunburned Country" - the audio version had received reasonable reviews and his performance was indeed adequately entertaining. For this reason I assumed that "Neither Here Nor There" would be equally enjoyable. I was wrong. Bryson's deadpan monologue makes it sound as though he was bored out of his mind while reading this book. Passages that may have seemed amusing in the written version are herein delivered in a sleep-inducing monotone. The sardonically comedic talent he displayed in his reading of "In a Sunburned Country" is totally lacking. I would recommend this audiobook only as a cure for insomnia 
 This book is terrible.  It is very hard to understand.  Not recommended 
 I am a postgraduate student in finance and this book is on my reading list for corporate finance. I must say that I am not very pleased with this book. First, it seems to skip around from chapter to chapter with no real logical organizational structure. Second, it is full of typos and mistakes -- some that are quite dangerous for a proper understanding of the material. Third, it does not develop fully the statistically techniques in Chapter 4 that it builds on in later chapters. This is a major problem in my opinion. What saves this book from the lowest rating is that it does discuss empirical studies and journal articles, and it does not do an entirely awful job about the more qualitative subjects like adverse selection and capitalization policy.  For what it's worth, I received my undergraduate degree at Wharton and am now at the London School of Economics. Instead of this book, I recommend Brealey and Myer's Principles of Corporate Finance. This is what I used as an undergraduate and is what seems to be the de facto textbook in the top undergraduate and MBA programs.  N 
 There is no measure how harmful and disastrous this "sermon" has been to all who have read or heard it.  The teaching of hell or everlasting damnation (eternal torment) is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of Christianity over 1800 years ago.  The first century church never believed in a "hell".  The theory of hell was brought in by converts to Christianity from  pagan religions of the world.  "Hell" was embraced by the political/religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and "converting" effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as "orthodox" centuries after the resurrection of Christ.  Our English translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact, when it is actually fiction.  Mostly all English versions except the Concordant Literal New Testament and Young's Literal propagate this fallacy.  Do your homework.  Go to www dot what-the-hell-is-hell dot com and www dot bible-truths dot com and read up.  If you scoff then here is your challenge.  Do the research from a non-traditional, non-pagan perspective and you might find incredible things to praise God about.  Other HIGHLY recommended books are "The Inescapable Love of God" by Thomas Talbott (ISBN: 1581128312, not on Amazon, you must google it), "The Origin and History of the Doctrine of Endless Punishment" by Thomas Thayer, "The Bible Hell" by Dr. John Wesley Hanson.  Go to the sites given above and finally get a better view of what "hell" is and where it came from.  You will find answers to the many questions that arise from searching this out.  All those who scoff and stop up your ears and move on, to you I say that the real hell is the one that your doctrine creates in the minds and hearts of all who have been indoctrinated by it and your view of God that it creates.  THAT is hell indeed, and THAT is the ONLY hell that exists 
 I bought this pump and used it on three bikes, a total of 5 tires before the foot pedal bent, then broke.  If you need a pump, I suggest going to a bike store and paying for a good one.  I tried to go the inexpensive route and learned my lesson.  Bell products are cheaply made and don't last beyond a few uses.  Don't make my mistake and disappoint your kids on a Sunday when there's nothing you can do about it except to drive to the nearest gas station for air.  Stay away from this, and other "pedestrian" pumps.  Makes you wonder what a Bell helmet will look like after a spill 
 Supposedly the author is a historian, however, nothing in terms of research method has been applied; this is a work of journalism, and very much on the simplistic side. The book contains some very selective use of sources, to prove the objective stated at the onset (in preface): That Heisenberg was morally corrupt, and at that a representative for German culture. It does not get more advanced than that in the rest of the book, so one can basically stop reading after the preface 
 I didn't get 20 pages into this book before I said ENOUGH ALREADY GET TO THE PART WITH THE WHALES.  Sheesh.  Maybe the ending is good.  Maybe Ishmael and the whale become lifelong friends and live happily ever after.  I do not know because Mr. Melville wont stop rambling on and get to the POINT.  There is a nice picture of a whale on the cover of my copy anyway so that rates this book as TWO STARS.  The rest is mostly junk.  Back to the drawing board 
 The idea of this book -- a collection of short stories that explore the rich phenomenon of why people ride motorcycles -- is terrific; but the execution is disgusting. Anyone genuinely clueless and curious about why people ride would get a perverse enlightenment from SHE'S A BAD MOTORCYCLE. Just one story from a Hell's Angel perspective would have been plenty. Instead, most of the selections are from motorcycle gang members who are too busy bragging about raping, terrorizing, torturing, and pillaging to bother with good writing. Few ever get around to the subject of what motorcycle riding means to them.  Zanetti also seems to have trouble finding a ride out of California. The other 49 states are severely under represented.  The only reason this book is worth even 2 stars is that it includes a couple token gems that deserve far better company. Entries from Melissa Holbrook Pierson, Robert F. Fulton, and a handful of others aren't enough to make the book worth buying; but they are well worth reading on their own 
 this is a one song album I am doctor u all know it its on every drive-thru sample CD but be careful!!!!!!!! because that is the ONLY song they have! 
 I purchased this after reading rave reviews as well as the recommendation by my company and was very disappointed. Even though I have a BA in Business, I'm always looking for new ideas and ways to learn.  However, I was disappointed at how much Charan oversimplified some basic terms and didn't even give a thorough defintion of "velocity" -- one of his key points.  I read in just a few hours and am giving to goodwill -- one of the few books I won't put in my home library 
 The only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck. I've read a number of James Patterson books and while I'm not a hard core fan, I've enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell.   As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour).   Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller.   The twists at the end - "he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...." by the end, I just didn't care.   James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end. 
 Okay, my wife and I just watched this yesterday and I have to say I'm shocked to see all the good reviews.  I was almost in tears I was so bored.  It was like a really bad 'made-for-TV' movie!  I swear if it weren't for the chemistry between Bette Midler and Dennis Farina it would have been a complete waste of time...At least they were funny and natural and believable.  Their daughter, played by Paula Marshall was terrible.  The whole story was ruined by horrid acting (the two leads aside) and crappy dialog.  When we saw the movie at the library we were excited for the plot (about a divorced couple played by Midler and Farina who hate each other rekindling their passion for each other and starting up an affair during their daughters wedding) seemed like it would be funny and enjoyable.  Boy were we wrong.  This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Don't waste your time 
 My friend has a minor talking role in this, so I downloaded it to see my friend, and because I admire some of De Palma's past work. The film displayed plenty of talent in all areas except script. I lost interest by the halfway point, and watched through the end only because of my personal connection. Plot resolution was implausible, even if it's based on fact. Characters fell apart 
 Why in the world would anyone publish a writer's bread and butter notes to his agent?  Besides the money, I mean.  There are a couple or three interesting fulminations against this publisher or that editor, whom Heinlein feels did him dirty.  But in the main this body of correspondence is of zero interest to any but the most complete worshipers of the sf master.  Just enjoy the stories, and nevermind the workaday business of how they got published 
 This book sux, i'm not even joking, its crap. All the info is bs, and you can find more out about everything on the internet, with (gasp) Color pictures!?! This book has black and white pics...and not very many of them, if i could give this book absolutely no stars at all i would. ITS CRAP!! DON'T WASTE YOU'RE MONEY! 
 Not much information to find in this book, though it can be entertaining if you are bitter and need to find something to read while you are in the same situation.  Don't look for answers from this self helper, there are none.  Spend your money on ice cream instead.  You'll be happy you did 
 Don't waste your money on this book. I got it thinking it was going to be an interesting, fact-based, well-researched book on Mary Magdalene. Instead it was a hate-filled attack on not only Christianity but on Jesus Himself, describing Him as a drunken and gluttonous Egyptian magician no different than any other "nut" in Palestine claiming to be the Messiah. I really have nothing to add that hasn't been said in the many other negative reviews that this book gotten. As mentioned before by other reviewers, the author has a personal and childish agenda against Christ and the entire religion of Christianity and it is so transparent. Not only is the research flawed, with major misunderstandings about basic Christian beliefs like the Immaculate Conception, Apostolic Succession,the Authority of the Pope, et cetera, but as a psychologist I can see, in my opinion, some major emotional problems with this author. I won't go into a case study of her that I could come up with after reading her book,but the main problem is that after losing the high of her conversion experience, which she readily admits, she goes into the other extreme of hating Jesus and God and the Church and trying to keep up the high of that experience by writing a "National Enquirer" type of book to try to tear down Christianity.I was stunned and sickened by the venom she spewed onto Jesus and her sad and flimsy attempt to raise up Mary Magdalene into some kind of goddess. Sorry Lynn, but you have failed miserably.Not only is your book going into my garbage can, but it has strongly reinforced my love for Christ and my committment to His Church and the wonderful gift He has given to us in his life, death, and Resurrection. May God have mercy on your soul.. 
 the premise was great, a really nice idea for a book.  there were a few interesting statistics in the book, but overall i found the book pointless and rambling.  i'm still not sure what i was supposed to have taken from it.  was there a point?    i agree wholeheartedly with a previous poster who wondered about eisenberg's definition of "middle class".  despite a couple of charts breaking assets and earnings up by quintile, his anecdotes and stories clearly predominantly focused on the top fifth or top tenth of americans.  
 I have always loved books by Debbie Macomber, but this one is the exception.  It seemed forced and disjointed--would not recommend at all...maybe this series should come to an end 
 While this book presents itself as a "behind the scenes" accounting of the drug companies -- there are several factors that made me very skeptical while reading it.  First off, I am not someone associated with the pharm companies and I've never received any money from them.  However, being someone in the medical field, I was immediately concerned when Dr. Healy states  on numerous occasions that SSRI's have conclusively been proven to *cause* suicidial thoughts.  Anyone in science knows the danger of stating causation.  The truth is, we don't know why SSRI's are *associated* with some increased suicidial ideation.  Furthermore, Dr. Healy completely negelects recent finds that SSRI's are associated with increased BDNF levels, which strongly suggest that high 5HT levels result in neuronal growth.  This one sided treatment of the issue becomes apparent in this book as the author slowly emerges as someone who has a personal axe to grind and, frankly, appears to be a hired-gun for the plantiff's bar.  He essentially states that SSRI's are *worse* than placebo for treating depression and that patient's who take them are too stupid to know the difference between placebo and effective treatment.  Unfortunately, these factors cast serious doubts on the entirelty of this work.   Pass it by as polemics. 
 Anyone who saw this film and gave this more that a 1 star rating must have been on some powerful halucingens to think this movies was anything other than a complete waste of time. Sure it looks good by the cover and the summary, but when I had a group of friends over to all watch this for the first time, we instantly realized why none of us had heard of this movie before. Even porn has higher callibur acting, cinematography, and dialog than this movie! The only saving grace to watching this film was the alcohol on hand to stomach it and having 8 catty friends openly rip it apart Like Tom Servo on Mystery Science Theater! DO NOT BUY THIS FILM! (luckily I got it as a gift).  
 My 5 year old daughter, who has seen me return home from the pottery studio with my works in hand, was really excited to received her own pottery wheel for her birthday.  We were both greatly disappointed to find that the wheel power was so insufficient that each time she even gently placed her hands on the clay, the wheel came to a grinding halt.  Given this, it was impossible to even teach her the basics of centering clay, let alone create any sort of thrown piece.  I did not expect this to work as well as the wheels I use, but I did expect that she could at least learn a few fundamental skills.  This product was completely disappointing and I would not recommend it, particularly if there is no parent with throwing experience.  If this is the best product out there, I recommend sticking to hand building with clay--they can learn to thrown on a wheel when they are old enough to go to a proper studio 
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me 
 Whoever wrote the narrative on the inside cover flap did a fantastic job - it made me immediately purchase the book.  I kept reading, thinking that maybe there might be more interesting plot, story, anything.  But alas, I finished the book bitterly disappointed.  If thats all it takes to get published these days, I have 70 volumes of mind numbing journals I want to get published as quickly as possible.  I hate to say it, but it's one of the worst I've ever read 
 I expected more african vocals in it.. thats the main reason i brought the cd, i recently became a fan of that kind of music.. it had like 3 songs on there that i liked, besides that this album is garbag 
 I'm amazed at the positive reviews this book has received. If found it severely lacking for a number of reasons: First, it has very few maps, the ones it does have are terrible, and there is no coordination between descriptions of things and their location on the maps. Second, it lacks the kind of detail that you'll find in some other books. Finally, the section dealing with accommodations is almost completely useless. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this book.  If you want really good London tavel guides, the Rough Gude to London and the Eyewitness London guide are far, far better 
 Ok, these tasted good although they were much tougher than the sugared brand.  I ate about a serving and a half and so did my husband right after we got them.  That evening we both had bloating and terrible flatulence.  It was the holidays so I didn't immediately attribute it to the vines.  I brought some to work to satisfy my afternoon sugar cravings and ate another serving sitting at my desk.  Later that afternoon I was in an important meeting bloated beyond belief and trying not to embarrass myself.  I have since thrown out all my other bags--these things create at best a very embarrassing and uncomfortable several hours and at worse a terrible health problem.  I think they should be taken off the market or at least labelled with a warning "may cause significant distress to your digestive track and embarrassing flatulence! 
 Please do not bother to order this book. The company will take your money and weeks later decide to send you an email stating that they do not sell the book anymore.  Thank god I FINALLY got my nine bucks back 
 You'll need Viagra to get up to speed for the exam after reading this one. I am an MCSE, CCNA and a technical writer for several leading tech rags, and I have to say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. The author spends more time trying to "make it interesting" than giving you useful info that you can actually use. Example: During the discussion on Site Links the author fails to inform you that if you plan to use SMTP to perform directory replication that DCs need to be in different domains and in different sites. This minor oversight could have a huge impact both on the exam and in the real world. Another example is the complete lack of a discussion on how the tombstone setting of directory objects affects the effective shelf life of your backups. Hello???? It's like Sybex just followed the bare minimum in order to call this thing a study guide. The software is ok, but the free practice exams were weak as expected. I like books that I can keep as reference material after I read them. The only thing you will use this one for is lining your garbage can. Don't waste your time with this dribble. Get a real book 
 I found the book disappointing with very little information specific to debt collection.  I was hoping for insights into the collection industry, however, the first 25 pages were devoted to a very general business plan.  The Fair Information Act infomation is available online for free and the final chapter consisted of self-congratulations by the author. I wish Mr. Bills had shared his considerable knowledge of the industry in much more depth 
 AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I bought this for a little over $15 at another store and returned it within a week...Horrible transfer (if it were ALPHA video i wouldn't care, but come on...this is a major DVD company we're talking about, SONY!!!!!). Aspect ratio isnt the theatrical format, but rather PAN AND SCAN cropped sides bulls#it. Plus its missing like 20 minutes! I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. Just the thought of this release makes me angry (to the point of inarticulate). AVOID AVOID AVOID! and write a letter to your congressman (ha!)...or perhaps SONY/MGM. This release is inexcusable 
 As a true beginner, I had a lot of trouble understanding the concepts in the book. It did not give nearly as many examples as were necessary nor was the presentation beginner friendly. I wouldn't recommend this book... unfortunately, I don't know of a good alternative 
   I went through a big Hawkwind phase in the early 90s and remember the excitement and joy when this CD arrived at the local mall from being specially ordered (This was before the internet was big, and odd, weird, unpopular stuff had to be special ordered by phone or catalog)    On first listen, I was let down.  'You Shouldn't Do That' can be described as one of most atrocious instrumentals known to man.  It does start off cool enough with an eerie, trippy special effect intro simulating something taking off into space.  Then as soon as the saxophone kicks in, everything turns to crap!  It's one thing to know how to play the sax and quite another to just mindlessly blow into the stupid thing.  Anyways, when all the key instruments get introduced in the beginning and kind of work their way up into the main riff, it then sounds like the sax and guitar start vomiting on eachother, and then it repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats until they vomit on eachother again; then repeats a few more dozen times for a total of 15 painful minutes!!  At one point, everyone in the group seemed content to plunk out any old note which made the song barely listenable at all.  By then, the only musician holding this fiasco together was the drummer.  And the lyrics?  Why would you put non-sensical hippeeisms into a so called 'space rock' song?  I dont know.  Out of the 30 or 40 times I heard this song, I only sat through the WHOLE thing twice!!  Apologies to die-hard fans for slamming this track, but it really IS that bad and puts a big dent in the album considering its length.      Now that that atrocity is out of the way, on to the rest of the album- the other songs aren't really that bad and make for some interesting soundscape music.  'You're Only Dreaming' has a wonderful 'breath of fresh air' motif as a backing to it's graceful swirl of electrics.  'Master of the Universe' was the sinister heavy metal track about the all supreme being- the guitar chords to this are nice fat and distorted.  I do prefer this version to the 'Space Ritual' version because even though the Ritual's version is faster and heavier,  it repeats itself beyond all levels of tolerance.  'In Search of Space's' version seems slower but shorter and to the point at the same time.    'Adjust Me' is another exploration of atmosphere and fuzzed out electronics.  It conjures up images of an android assembly plant and one of them seems to malfunction beyond control: 'adjust me... adjust meee adjust meeeee  adjust meeeeeeeeeeee'.  Very cool.       'We took the Wrong Step Years Ago' and 'Children of the Sun' are very extremely well played acoustic works that draw beautiful, lush, vivid images.  I would say that mr. Brock fares better with the acoustic guitar than the electric.  He has very good rythm.      All in all, a decent early 70s space rock album save for the first 15 minute bowel movement.  It renders this album rather short but thankfully, the re-issue has bonus tracks to make up for this.  
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 I'm a very big fan of Peace Orchestra and the K&D sessions.  But this album was a big letdown.  I didn't like the way he repeated the same vocal samples -- OK in some situations but these were not wise selections because they leave you hanging, wondering what the rest of the conversation was about.  I found this to be very irritating the first time I listened to the album on earphones.  Another thing I was disappointed with was the lack of instrumental or vocal performances.  There was no musicianship in this album, only background beats, chord structure, and decorative samples.  The entire album was pure backup with no starring performance.  
 I am very disappointed with this book.  I wanted a book to help me keep track of my daily intake of calories. Not pages and pages full of the author's opinions and tips on weight loss. A lot of the items listed are commercial food that by law have to carry nutrition info anyway. I am prefectly capable of reading a nutrition lable for calories, I don't need the added step of finding it in this book, which doesn't have a very good order of listing items in my opinion. Instead I recommend "The Doctors Pocket Calorie, Fat & Carbohydrate Counter: 2002 Edition, Plus 101 Fast Food Chains and Restaurants" and "The Complete and Up-to-Date Fat Book: A Guide to the Fat, Calories and Fat Percentages in Your Food" - both of which are available from amazon 
 While I am very careful to avoid discomfort and injury when learning a physical activity from a book, this book was so difficult for me to follow that I ended up experiencing pain after my first session.  Not only that, but this session was only meant to familiarize myself with the stretches and assess my flexibility!!  Luckily I could sense the problems well enough to stop after about 8 of the stretches.  The only way I will attempt this method in the future is with instruction and close supervision by a qualified person.  As others have pointed out, maybe there are better AIS books to learn from, but after this experience, I am extremely skeptical to try with ANY book 
 yo, this is garbage for now and forever. How can another weak muthaf@#ker diss another weak mf. No limit is garbage, yo hear that LIL p. See your face soon in the headlines "Garbage Reviewer Found Slain;Choked with a tank Chain". Get it straight homeboy, go buy Qb finest, Prodigy, CNN and Nature. Learn what this rap game is about 
 In the book Catherine stops a lot of guys from marrying her .She does that because she doesn't want to get married .Catherine likes to catch stuff on fire like guy who try to marry her. She also hides from her chores all the time because it makes her look like a good wife .She hates writing her journal. She also hates her father trying to marry her off 
 To me, this book seems to have been written from a great distance. When are caucasian writers going to stop calling themselves "bold" and "daring" when they "lift the curtain" on Chinatown?  Stop all the self-congratulation. This is a book written from the point of  view of an OUTSIDER, which is okay, but let's call it what it is. Read  "The New Chinatown" by Peter Kwong or "Born to Kill" by  T.J. English, both books about the Asian community written with compassion  and understanding 
 Eight years ago today was the day Blondie's reunion album was released, and though it was great to see Blondie back together, No Exit just fell short on many levels. 2004's The Curse of Blondie(see my review also on Amazon)is a much better album and should have been their comeback. No Exit won't exactly take you back to the hooks that made Blondie famous. Harry's lyrics are wonderful in "Double Take," but the deadpan melody literally kills the song. Fans were also not terribly waiting for jazz standards("Boom Boom in the Zoom Zoom Room") or revamped demo tracks("Out in the Streets"), but the worst cut is the title song that includes a rap verse by Coolio. Both the band and Coolio could have thought of something more productive to sing about. The music isn't catchy either. All is not lost with songs like "Night Wind Sent," and Harry's own transformation in "Forgive and Forget, plus who would dare argue Blondie's potential to shake the pop world again when you hear "Maria." As the album's best track, "Maria" is a wonderful reminder of how Blondie, and Debbie, can still create an infectious pop song that leaves a template on the mind 
 very basic introduction  to yoga and it's benifits it offers to some people. I tried a class with my girl friends and perk my interest but i was unbale to get into these positions the author suggested without some discomfort may work for others 
 As a Prince freak let me start off by saying that i love pretty much everything he's ever put out...genius! this is for the casual fans out there...i don't want to see anyone get "juked". THIS IS NOT A CD OF REMIXES OF THE ORIGINAL SONGS/BEATS. it's more like a dance remix you would hear at one of those annoying "glow stick clubs"...i love Princes' music but this one is going to have to grow on me...I AM A HUGE FAN...IF YOU ARE NOT A HUGE FAN...U WANT 2 PASS ON THIS ONE...!...ONLY FOR U IF YOU'RE A COLLECTOR... 
 First let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail... He does not. He hikes less than a third. You dont find this out until 2/3 through the book, which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad, to an ill effort to fulfill a contract.   My conclusion on this book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his publisher, could not, and stuffed the remainder of the book with verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless statistics.   As others have said in this review forum. This book can be snide, highschoolish and down right mean. I fail to see the "wit" in his endless negitivity and bashing.   This book has a few funny parts, but I cant help but feel that it is a huge exageration of real events, and is mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments. It is so unbelievible in places, that you know you are on an imagined tangent.   Dont waste your money or time. I am so happy I bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale! 
 Site says "NEW" item..but found the plastic cut and opened..when asked seller replied giving many reasons..like... to bring down shipping cost (how ?), or otherwise the price wont be so low ( does that mean give opened item saying NEW) or it was too late to update (we can wait) ...Though Product works well but i had given money for new item..!!! Who knows how long it will work..so think before  you buy..opened item is called NEW here ! 
 Buyer beware.  This reader does not work with large SD cards.  I could not get it to work with a new 4 GB SD card.  My 1 GB cards work fine, but anything over that will probably not work.  I confirmed with with Lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet 
 Unlike most other Examples & Explanations Series, this one is one of the worst I have read.  Authors waste too much time on history of criminal law and MPC, and very little time explaining the law.  Common law and MPC are not distinguished and characterized well, and no clear conclusions of law are given.  The example are very plane, without exploring the variety and complexity of real-life problems.  Unbelievably, only 35 pages are spent on homicide, the most common and complex problem in criminal law, and the examples and explanations for homicide are terrible 
 This biography is particularly deceiving as Mr. Barnes packages it wrapped in historical information, but then includes misinformation and gossip  presenting it all as facts 
 Firstly I have to say that this is not a Mobile Masterpiece production it is a BBC production.  The production itself is excellent, my favorite adaption of the Charles Dickens novel. Unfortunately the DVD has been put together as if you are watching the production on television.  There is an introduction by an American presenter who states that what you are watching is a Mobile production.  This is tolerable but once you start watching you find that little icons appear on the screen as would appear on television (I think they are to inform the viewer that wide screen is available).  Finally, before the end credits of the first part, you get to see what will be in next weeks episode. It would have been a simple matter to take the original recording as supplied by the BBC and use this one for the DVD.  For some reason the DVD producer decided that is was better to have exactly the same recording as was shown on American television. If you want to get a copy of this production I would recommend getting one that was made for the British market 
 This book should be title "in the mist of opium", Swain admitted that alot of his writting was done during the drug induced moments,  including his report of American bombing of Kampuchea. What is not cover  here is how Swain convinietly ignore the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge and  his portrait of them as "valiant" fighter against a corrupt  Western-backed regime. Swain like many of his fellow  "journalists" at that time, was siken of the war and tries to  actively end the war by painting a bleak picture about the non-communist  and glorified the Marxist forces. Unfortunately the death of over 600,000  Vietnamese Boat People (as estimated by the UNHCR, 250,000 Vietnamese  "Corrective Labor Reeducation" slaves and several millions Khmers  prove that sometimes "Peace at Any Price" is worst than war, if  the evil side wins 
 I hate to be rude but I have been building with FrontPage 2002 for years. It has so many templates and features but I thought it was time for an upgrade. I am thankful  that the original FrontPage is still running on my laptop or I don't think my latest sites would be up yet. Sorry, I don't mean to be mean. It may be like other programs that you can get training or have to take a class to do the things that FrontPages just does automatically. I'm sure it is fine as a stand alone creator software but to call it an upgrade, I don't know. 
 The ideas behind 15 minutes aren't bad at all. Take one Robert DeNiro, put him in New York, mix him with some American-dream hunting Eastern Europeans on a killing spree, and try to provoke some emotions, and have a sly dig at the American justice system. Lets see...nothing happened...only repulse.  If, like everyone else, you plan on watching this film because DeNiro is in it, you will be dissapointed. He puts in a tired performance, almost as if he knows the film is a load of B.S. The attempt to be hard-hitting goes horribly wrong, instead it's just repulsive over the top violence, and its pointless...naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces, why? There are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning, such as 8mm (the horrible subject of snuff movies, hard-hitting meaningfull film), 15 minutes is far from meaningfull. We all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that, but when converting it to a film, it needs a deeper meaning, otherwise it turns into melodramatic Hollywood [...].  If you like brain-dead gore and violence, lack of plot and cringing melodrama. Go ahead 
 Cool band.  worst videos ever.  ever.  makes me like them less.  Fearless Freaks is good.  This is garbage... 
 This book was a disappointment... Yes of course McCartney is talking about travel photography and gives a few -good- advices but the book is a real pain to read. She keeps talking about herself and how great she is and how many countries she traveled and another couples of very useless stories. Also some points are very discutable.... p23 "You don't have to be handsome or beautiful to be a successful photographer, but you should strive to be as physically attractive and well-groomed as you can be." To conclude, there are very few photographies, B/W, outdated and some of them not very interesting at all.  
 I am a big fan of Dick's. His short stories are his strength, his imagination is superb, but this novel is peculiar to say the very least. I am well aware that a major criticism of his body of work is the uneven writing. Sometimes he soars, but at other times it feels as though he wrote a book in a week and stuffed it in an envelope and mailed it off to the publisher without giving it another thought. This is just such a book. How it won the John W. Campbell Memorial award for the best novel of 1974 is beyond me. It would never get published today.  The beginning is classic Dick: a famous man wakes up in  a flophouse after a murder attempt on his life and finds that he doesn't exist. No records, no biography, fame all gone, a pocket full of money, that's it. But from that point on the story lumbers from one encounter with a ditzy woman to another. It's all rambling filler that has nothing to do with the story. The policeman in the title doesn't show up until halfway through. Granted, the story picks up a bit at that point, but then it loses its focus again and the ending is a rush job if ever there was one. The whole thing turns out to be a drug induced figment of his imagination. How disappointing is that? That's as bad as  those Star Trek time travel episodes where everyone goes through absolute hell, they should all be traumatized for life and suffer from terminal PTSD, but then the loop is completed and it's as though none of it ever happened. Arghhh!   If you think Dick was one of the great Sci-Fi masters of all time, read this book, but keep it in context with his corpus of work (i.e. somewhere in the bottom half). If you are just starting to read Dick, skip this one for a while. But by all means read his short stories. Some of them are keepers for all time.  
 I like reading.  I am a literature snob.  I put down poorly written novels (even though I can't write well myself!).  But, I think I've met my match in this novel.  I recognize the style is something unique, but I just couldn't grasp the rhythm.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with those who gave this book thumbs down.  I really want to be in the group that appreciates this Plitzer Prize novel, but I don't make the cut.        HOwever, I'd love to read more from reviewers on what they saw in this book because I just couldn't find much other than the rambling thoughts of a very whiny and boring 40-something man whom I would't enjoy spending a 3-day-weekend with at all.        I've persistantly struggled through 180 pages, but now will surrender!   
 This toy is fun... but a bit on the creepy side.  Also, it loses its appeal kind of fast 
 Clavell is often ranked among the greatest writers of the last quarter of the twentieth-century, and I am not at all sure he belongs there. I've read several of his books and while I loved Shogun, ALL his novels had:   A) The same recurring themes and in a few cases literally the same storylines (and even the same sentences) recycled for re-use....   B) The same frustrating lack of a definite ending...   C) A habit of carrying the "Asia good/Europe bad" tone a little too far.   Clavell here dishes up a looooong, slow as a melting glacier, story of westerners in 1860's Japan, all of whom are trying to better themselves with economic or political opportunities in this newly-opened Asian kingdom. The French, the Americans, and the British are all in competition for control of the island, as are a number of cut-throat international corporations. Gai-Jin (a rude Japanese term for a person of foreign birth, roughly equal to such western slurs as "WOP" "Spic" or "Mic") is simultaneously the story of internal strife in a Japan in transition from the age of the samurai to the era of industrialization: and ultimately global ambitions.   Clavell introduces generally well-conceived characters but there isn't much of a story to move them through. As is so often the case with this man, there is a constant sense that "wow, something big is going to happen soon in this novel" and then upon reaching what passes for an ending, discovering that despite your long-held hopes, nothing ever does happen.   When I completed this demanding, often far-fetched novel, I cannot say I had regrets for having read it, but I do remember a strong sense of letdown. For those interested in saving themselves roughly a hundred hours of reading time but getting the same story in return, watch Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai, which is set in the same time and place as Gai-Jin, and deals with roughly the same themes and issues 
 First off I would like to say the authors like Peter David are what has killed sci-fi literature.  This book, and the others in the series, only offers stale and emotionless sequence actions taken by the fairly flat characters in the book.  It would have been more enjoyable as a two-page outline of events. At least then I would not have felt cheated 
 I was assigned this book as preparation for an A.P. English class, and I was incredibly disappointed with it. Although it features some stirring stories of bravery and compassion (hence the two stars), every word of it is poured over with syrup and then carelessly vomited onto the page. Only about half of the words in this book are necessary at all to the context of the stories it tells; the rest are flag-waving literary masturbation. Consider sentences like these:  "Millions of men and women were involved in this tumultous journey through adversity and achievement, despair and triumph. Certainly there were those who failed to measure up, but taken as a whole this generation did have a 'rendezvous with destiny' that went well beyond the outsized expectations of President Roosevelt when he first issued that call to duty in 1936."  Yes, I get it, Grandma and Grandpa were great! Now please, sir, learn how to structure a sentence! Most of the rest of the book is mindlessly self-indulgent treacle in this repetitive vein. How this man got a book deal is comprehensible to me only because I know how famous Brokaw is, but how any sadly misinformed American bought this book is more than beyond me. Please, if you respect yourself as a human being, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 I was expected more model of the book but the whole book only teached one model 
 Everyone (or nearly everyone) seems to love this book. So, we tried it - and had a visceral negative reaction. We read to our daughter every day. I try hard to stop what I am doing and read to her when she comes toddling up with a book in her hands. For the sake of sanity, we've experimented with picture books, particularly rhyming picture books, but really anything with very brief text so we don't go completely mad with repetition. This is NOT behavior we wanted to introduce to our toddler daughter. That said, when she's older and able to understand that the pigeon's behavior is not to be emulated, we might give this another try. maybe 
 The quality of material (paper) is good.  The font letter is big enough.  If you are thinking on buy it, maybe you should read at least Part I.  That will give you a better idea about the book.  The description on the back cover gave me a different perception, and based on other reviewers, I am not the only one. ---------------  The origin of human being is something that can not be answered with scientific facts.  Many theories are related to this topic, trying to give the answer.  Some of them have scientific facts, but other appears to be fiction, mixing finding facts with fiction tales, similar to this book.  The book tries to give the answer of human origins.  The theory exposed is that human is the result of an extraterrestrial's experiment (Extraterrestrial beings are called Advanced Beings, ABs).  The theory exposed has lacks of evidence. They are based on theories and questions that can not be answered from the scientific point of view... yet.  Trying to make you believe on ABs theory, the book gives a storm of tales about issues and theories related with ABs experiences.  Also, mention some regressions, cultures that are lost, and the stories about ABs intervention on the science progress.  The writer didn't verify those tales or stories about ABs.  He just wrote about them to conclude the existence of ABs.  He mix  stories and tales with myths, and sometimes with partial scientific facts.  More than a research the book looks to be a compilation on extraterrestrial stories with some "try" of intrigue.  The result is an informal theory that looks a fiction book, but with some inconsistences that made me lost interest on it.  I think that I am an open mind, trying to know more and more,  and I accept other perceptions of the universe.  I bought the book trying to read about none human intervention on human "history".  From my point of view, I would change one word "history" by "story" on the title to be more clear of what about this book is. Some readers could find it interesting, but is not my case 
 So I saw this one live action Alice in Wonderland movie and it sucked!!!! But I'm confused this isn't the same girl in that movie so this another live action movie, I think it is. I'm not sure if I want to risk boring myself with other crap... so will I watch this verison ever... who knows 
 It's unclear for what audience this series of guidebooks is intended.  The first-time visitor will find them totally bewildering, while the seasoned traveler will inevitably quibble with the extremely quirky choice of locations included, none of which is marked on the rudimentary map on the inside back flyleaf.  The 100 tiny pages, presumably intended to fit into a trouser pocket or small purse, are largely devoted to photographs (attractive), but which reduce still further the space for actual travel information.  Wallpaper would have done much better to have merely collected in one place all the great restaurants, hotels, shops, and services featured monthly in the pages of their magazine.  Instead, only four shops are featured for a city as huge and varied as London!  The idea of reserving only one page for an alleged "insider" profile (once again with minimal "tips," none of them marked on a map) is an interesting "concept" but nearly useless to any traveler.  It would appear that Wallpaper's aim was to present each city as a "concept" rather than a series of useful, practical pieces of information (why then an entire section on "escaping" from the city, when you've hardly even discovered it?), but in the end it's mostly an interesting conceit that will appeal to devotees who don't really need another guidebook at all.  I religiously clip the tear-out travel pages in the monthly magazine; the recent page for London contains far more useful information for the traveler than this entire book (and has a useful map besides).  Wallpaper the magazine is a terrific treasure-trove of cutting-edge information for the on-the-go, in-the-know citizen of the world.  In reducing the format and the content, however, both the excitement and the utility have been pared away as well.  What could have been a stunning series is instead little more than a curiosity 
 The author seems bent on impressing us with her "literary knowledge" and tosses in quotes for effect. However, the book remains the whining self-important story of one person from a wacked-out family. Grow up and move on. I hope this isn't representative of my proud Italian heritage. I was given this for Christmas and was sorely disappointed 
 After reading this you'll want to nail somebody to something to.  What type of spirit in the word spiritual did the writer of these musings mean.  After this man is departed they will have to add another circle to hell.  This is just sacarine coated nausious rubbish.  I despair at some publishers sometimes. 
 I realize that all the previous reviewers are from other parts of the world and I am from the part of the world so peculiarly described by Mr. Meredith --- and maybe I know better, and maybe I am biased. But I think Mr. Meredith has decided to do a powerful portrait in black (if I may say so) of the whole of Africa, and given that his book is almost entirely descriptive, the portrait is powerful enough indeed. The review from the gentleman from Bangladesh states the ultimate conclusion that one might have if one ignores the fact that Africa is still pretty much colonized, and that it is not so much that the Whites are gone as that they are hidden (only their helping hand is made visible). In any case, my overall impression is that the book is very informative on many of the crimes and horrors that have plagued Africa since the inception of the colonial era (with a concentration on the post-colonial period) but totally neglects the best programs of social and political emancipation which, by the way, can be symbolized by Mandela and Senghor only from a Western point of view. From an African point of view, Mandela has not had the chance to be a real leader and Senghor was a puppet of French neo-colonialism. The real leaders were people like Modibo Keita, Thomas Sankara, Seyni Kountche, in the Francophone countries that I know best. The author also ignores the economic structure of today's Africa, which is only beginning to shift from the colonial polarization to the emergence of an internal market, not without success in some cases, and tragedies in others. I think if the author had been less the journalist that he is by profession, in order to illuminate his narrative with structural analyses, he would have given a more complete vision of the continent, and one that would have made more sense of its evolution. Furthemore, living in Africa, one does not necessarily have the sense of violent decline that is described here. I am from a country which didn't know a single year of civil war, or ethnic brawl. There have been three coups d'etat, which on the whole I think were beneficial to the country. We now have a democratic system. I don't like our politicians: I don't think they have intelligent designs for the country, and they aren't at all above corruption. We have dire economic problems. But life there is peaceful, a bit drowsy and has its many charms. I should add that I am from the better-off section of society and that might taint my vision. But really, I do not have the impression of living in the hell pit of bloody feuds and utter corruption (I am 35, and have so far never had the occasion to bribe a civil servant in my country, although I know very well that corruption exists) that emerges from this book, and I'd venture to say that many Africans out of the warring areas will think that the book is a bit much. My general experience is that countries differ a lot, despite the kind of uniformity that Mr. Meredith sought to impose on us in this book. I won't be happy in Nigeria for instance. I liked Ghana. I am not desperate. I think we need peace and time, and the kind of help that works on structures (education and health) not on symptoms (corruption and poverty). Mr. Meredith book isn't helpful in that sense, and that's why although I found it informative, I never recommend it. 
 A dull tome, uninteresting and overpriced.  Might make a good doorstop perhaps, or be excellent for starting fires, but I wouldn't suggest the book to anyone I might run into again.    The author seems to have only a slight grasp of the subject.  Important concepts are overlooked, and it seems to have been written for ego gratification or to drum up business, rather than to explain the concepts of asset protection.  Take a pass on this one.   
 THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS MOVIE IS VERY INTERESTING....DONT FALL FOR IT. THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED HAPPEN- DONT GET ME WRONG; BUT IN A PLODDING AND TALENTLESS WAY. THE SUBTITLES MOVE VERY FAST AND INTERFERES WITH YOUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY " SEE " THE MOVIE. ACTING VERY SUB PAR AND STORY NOT DISTINCTIVE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH RECOMMENDING TO A FRIEND OR WATCHING AGAIN 
 I was really hoping that it would focus more on the "Once" rather than the "Future", but I was sadly disappointed. Although there were a few choice morsels detailing the suffering that smallpox has caused to people in the past, and the history of inocculation was also quite interesting, most of the book discussed the long (and rather boring) history of the global eradication of the disease, and the current dilemma with smallpox virus samples being stored in various locations around the world. I mean, it's not like those topics aren't interesting... but they cannot compare with the horrific, wince-inducing facts about the illness itself 
 Don't be fooled. This is a purely pedantic and priggish book about Las Vegas. Not worth your time 
 I didn't know anything about author Iris Johansen before I picked up "Body of Lies" at the library, but as a thriller fan I thought I'd check out her brand of suspense. About fifty pages into the book I began suspecting that Ms. Johansen had a romance writing past. A check of her bibliography--with early titles like "Lion's Bride" and "The Magnificent Rogue"--confirmed my suspicions. Let me clarify that I have no problem with the romance genre, and Johansen certainly isn't the first romance novelist to make the jump to the thriller genre. But I prefer the thrillers I read to have a bit more edge, and Johansen's prose dulled that edge. Still, I kept reading because the story was intriging and fairly fast-paced. By page 200, though, I was starting to lose patience, and by page 300 my only motivation in finishing the novel was the anticipation of reading something else.  The characters Eve Duncan, her boyfriend Joe Quinn and Eve's adopted daughter Jane weren't terribly interesting to me and often seemed like they were all three the same person. Only the supporting character of Sean Galen seemed to possess any real personality. Too bad, because much of this story is told through dialog, which I don't have a problem with provided it's interesting dialog, but it isn't. Johansen--no Elmore Leonard she--prefers her characters in "Body of Lies" to spout off cliches or give us paragraph upon paragraph of exposition (between gazing, grimacing and moistening their lips, of course). In true detective show fashion, whenever the bad guys are cornered, they fill our heroine in on all their dastardly deeds, saving Eve the trouble of having to work too hard to dig it up on her own. Her story of an underground society of world leaders known only as the Cabal had potential, but it's wasted in this novel. Johansen seems on surer ground when dealing with Eve and Joe's turbulent, if irritating, relationship than political intrigue.  I don't want to be too hard on Johansen. Another disappointed reviewer mentioned her earlier thrillers being superior to this one, so maybe I just caught Iris when she wasn't quite on her game. However, I doubt I'll be reading another one of her books anytime soon. So now I'm going to wipe this grimace off my face, moisten my lips and turn my gaze to a different author.     
 Although all the other reviews simply rave about this 2 CD set, and "This CD set was awarded a rosette by the Penguin Guide to Compact Discs", I just listened to both CDS.  Very very disappointed.  The music is very bland, no passion, very passive. I could not believe what I was hearing.  Anytime I see ASMITF as the orchestra playing Mozart, I usually am pleased..but this time I was not.  I am sticking with Mitsuko Uchida (pianist) and Mr. Tate (conductor)...for her playing of the Mozart concertos.. 
 have you ever thought of the fact that after the first few weeks or months, babies NEED a good nights sleep as much as their parents?  children dont like to go to bed, but they need to anyway.  Anything a mom can do to incourage a good nights sleep in the longrun is not a "selfish mom" but an effective one 
 I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old. Luvable Friend's onsies are awful. The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies. And the velcro doesn't even stick. They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes. Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son. Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review! 
 This is my first John March mystery, and Red Cat does not tempt me to read his first 2 books. The plot concept is somewhat intriguing but after each interaction between John and his brother David, I lost more interest. Why does John allow himself to be abused by his brother? His brother David is a caricature. Ultimately I didn't care what happened to either of them and gave up 
 When we last left the Next Generation crew, Picard saved Data in an Errol Flynn kind of way against the Queen Borg.   Star Trek year: 2375.   We sure are missing the original Star Trek Enterprise crew of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc by now.   Worf who is now assisting Deep Space Nine boards the Enterprise for a visit.  Picard (Patrick Stewart) certainly has his hands full tonight with an elegant dinner for Regent Cuzar.  LaForge (Levar Burton) has an urgent message for Picard at the same time and Picard is trying to memorize the foreign language for greeting Regent Cuzar so as not to insult the Regent.   Admiral Doughtery (Anthony Zerbe) would like to tell Picard that Data (Brent Spiner) has been a naughty robot and will not obey Starfleet protocol. He is holding the Brair patch hostage, which is a population of 600 people.   Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) is the Son'a ship captain.  he enjoys partaking in a quick facial surgery procedure.  (Don't we all wish we could).  Ru'afo informs Picard, Data has turned dangerously violent and has done damage to the ship.  Data must be destroyed.  Picard has 12 hours to save data or Picard will terminate the android himself.   Also in the cast: Jonathan Frakes, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Donna Murphy, Gregg Henry, Michael Horton, McKenzie Westmore (NBC serial, Passions) is credited as a Ba'ku villager.    Does the Brair Patch have Cabbage Patch dolls too?  Sorry I coudn't resist.  Easter Egg: Disc 2 Special Features, click Star Trek Universe, click down to main menu, but do not press.  Use "right" button instead.  Middle octagon will turn blue.  Press "enter". Tom Morello will talk on location about playing "Sona".   Disc 2 also includes 6 deleted scenes and the Alternate Ending.   One deleted scene includes Max Grodench playing a Trill ensign.  He was "Rom" in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine tv series (1993-1999).    The next voyage is STAR TREK: NEMESIS (2002)  Update: J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof (ABC Network's LOST) will produce and direct STAR TREK XI.  Rumor is it will be a prequel about young James T. Kirk in the Starfleet Academy.  It will be released in 2008. 
 This is a very clever book, as far as I could make out, but very overrated. There were a few good, suspenseful scenes, but the military action was awfully repetitious. Perhaps the action is accurate and realistic, and it could potentially make an exciting movie, but it does not make good reading.  The basic premise, that the Soviet Union starts World War III in order to get oil, was ironic, given that President Bush has repeatedly been accused of attacking Iraq for the same reason. In both cases, I found the reasoning unconvincing.  Clancy's writing is pretty odinary, and often sloppy. I was particularly annoyed by the continual use of unexplained acronyms - I tried looking them up some of them in a book containing thousands of acronyms and could only find about half of them - and the military jargon was similarly confusing. Sometimes he would use a term extensively and then 30 pages later he'd explain what it meant. I suppose it would be all right for someone with more military background than I have, but a lot of the time I had no idea what was going on. I was also put off by the continual change of scene - I counted 17 scene changes in one chapter, and there are 43 chapters.  The military strategy and tactics are fascinating, but the plot of the novel is pretty basic. The characterisation is virtually non-existent - most of the characters sound the same.  This is the first Tom Clancy book I have read, and it makes me wonder how he manages to out-sell so many superior writers 
 This book is a huge disappointment.  Instead of discovering the history of a wonderful people, I found bigotry, racism, snobisness and intolerance.  At page 200 or so, and after many tries to warm up to this author with her narrow-minded and slanted views, I decided to just put it down and search for unbiased history in other sources. To readers who haven't visited the Balkans, I'd suggest save your money to actually travel there.  You won't be disappointed by the wonderful islands or it's people. 
 This was an awful movie.  The premise was an obvious rip off an Outer Limits episode (Straight and Narrow), but I was curious to see what could be done with the topic in a feature-length format.  I was sadly disappointed.  The film eliminated everything that was interesting about the Outer Limits episode, and instead filled itself with...nothing.  In the end the viewer is left with no real reason not to believe the "bad guys" about the hormonally induced killing being a temporary and soon to be remedied side effect.  By the time the credits rolled, I was not convinced that the microchips were a bad idea, when properly executed, and I don't think leaving the audience with that ambiguity was the intention of the filmmakers.  To sum up: don't watch this movie.  It's bad.  Watch the 1990's Outer Limits episode, "Straight and Narrow," starring Ryan Philippe, instead 
 This is the most ludicrous thing I've ever seen. Firstly, this book is putatively "written" by a snotnose who some neo-con writer probably thought would serve as a great marketing schtick. I mean, are we expected to believe that this kid has anything insightful or informative to say about the American media?? C'mon, people, go read McLuhan or something.    Secondly, WHAT LIBERAL MEDIA? As far as I can tell, even the liberals in the media are afraid to "rock the boat." They're ineffectual nothings who haven't practiced truly investigative reporting in decades (except for Seymour Hersch... much props). They operate as a collective unit of nebbishes, but at least they are the conservative media. By the way, Fox News is the number one news channel on cable television, so don't tell me that liberals control the media. There're plenty of people who watch the conservative crap proposing to be news. Wow, the American populace is dumb. THINK, FOLKS, THINK!! (NB: Yes, I'm an angry, but mostly objective, liberal 
 The basis of this book is a (argument), not scientific evidence.  Taking into account all that support this book, give a non-scientific opinion, more (political) in the end.  Walker is another eurocentric apologist who over looks the emperical evidence that ppl like Dr.Diop, Dr.Massey, Dr.Ben, Dr.Clarke etc., have presented, wether the objective was from euro-historians or afri-historians.      In the books that walker tries to refute by the mentioned authors, there is much evidence to support that Africans did indeed influence the Asians and Europeans, and that, Egypt(KMT) was indeed a African civilization, no where, but in Africa do you find those(aboriginals) that directly resemble, in appearance, culture and language, the Egyptian people and system, see: Wolof, Nok, Buganda, Yoruba, etc.  Facts are irrefutable, so, Mr.Walker should reread the books of Dr.Clarke, Diops, Jackson, Dr. Massey, etc., considering if he even read their work.      People tend to support with prejudice what makes them feel good at the end of the day.  Indeed, if Africentricity was a tool to reestablish black pride, then, one wouldnt need to look at ancient societies for a boost, another classic example of how wanna-be authoritarians mismatch information.  Black pride and black history are two different subjects inwhich Mr. Walker purposely doesn't make the distinction between the facts and opinions of himself and others, selective favoritism no doubt.      Mr. Walker is so full of himself, that he would have ppl to believe that colonialism, industrialism, imperialism, fascism,  etc. didnt have a negative effect on under-developing Africa and other europeanized stricken worlds.  This book is another example of european escapism from any wrong doing of others.  Books like these are becoming few and far between, as for all intelligent ppl will perceive facts, rather than believe in opinions.  My assertion(opinion supporting fact) of mainstream eurocentric babble.  p.i       
 This Book's focus seemed to be more about justifying Bill Gates' actions, and defending Microsoft against negative PR than the actual history of Microsoft.  A more fact-filled, play-by-play history of the rise of Microsoft would have been more interesting, I think 
 movie was fairly boring.Beckinsale is also pretty dumb.What kinda actress doesn't shave her armpits when she knows she has to do a nude scene.A total turnoff!! 
   I see several rave reviews with which I don't agree.  What I find absolutely incomprehensible is that almost all these reviewers make use of this book in Judeo-Christian religious formation.  Please be assured that this book is not only without religious or theologic value but will confuse your children or thoroughly misinform them.     Some heretical concepts which Marc Gellman advances through his book include: - creation which pre-existed God (denies ex-nihlo creation) - repeatedly points to God as limited in power, unable to complete creation,  - presents the fall of man and original sin as an act of ultimate love which God approved and found joy in.     The writing is cute and very creative, but cute doesn't count in what must be treated as a serious topic even for small children.  And "creativity" has no proper place here either.  We do not create.  We attempt to understand, explain, and imitate what God has created and revealed.        Don't waste your time or money on this book, and keep it away from your children.  A good alternative for stories in the bible would be... The Bible. 
 It's flimsy...breaks at the slightest touch...it's a PAIN to open and close!  My 15 month old figured out that all you have to do is shake the gate a little and it opens...I found this out when I was putting groceries away...I went to look for her and she was on the 2nd stair from the top!  I can't say enough bad things about this gate.  It's worthless.  If I could rate it MINUS stars I would 
 Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities.  The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album.  Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song.  The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason.  It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear.  The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'.  Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording.  Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL 
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 I strongly advise you against buying this DVD.  This is by far the worst Sesame Street video that we have in our collection...  My boy only sees the first two minutes in which Elmo appears, after that he totally looses interests in the video.  Overall, don't buy this DVD 
 My friends and I who love India share a lot of novels set there. I read the wonderful reviews of A Breath of Fresh Air and can't believe I just read the same book.  My copy will be passed along to the Goodwill! I would be embarrassed to loan this to my friends. The book is written from the point of view of three characters, yet the "voice" remains the same.  It repeats the same issues over and over. The plot was a great idea. The book lacks depth and development.   
 I really liked Suzanne Summers. I've read all her other books and have her tai chi exercise video. When I saw her on the Today show advertising this book I couldn't wait to get it.  She promotes the Schwarzbein Principle which states that being a vegetarian is unhealthy. Suzanne has an entire chapter dedicated to someone named Wendy who after 10 years of being a vegetarian was convinced to start eating meat again! Just because Wendy's particular diet was unhealthy, that doesn't mean that all vegetarians are unhealthy. There are meat eaters that have unhealthy diets. Look at all the Hindus in India, they're lifetime vegetarians and are healthy.   I know that soy has been a controversial subject recently, but it's the pill form of soy that is questionable, soy it it's natural form is healthy for you. How can you say that soy is bad for you when millions of East Asians eat soy as part of their daily diet? I've read countless books and research that supports the benefits of soy.  I eat a balanced vegetarian diet and get all the nutrients my body needs.  Just because one doctor doesn't believe that a vegetarian diet is healthy, doesn't make it a fact. Suzanne you've really gone too far to tell everyone to stop being a vegetarian. With that misinformation in your book, I have a hard time believing that anything else is true and fact. 
 I read about one hundred pages and then, when the consistency of the plot did not improve beyond that of an extra runny rice pudding, I quit. This was my first King book and I am not rushing out to buy another one, especially since it appears to me that this author is unable to pen down anything less than a 1000 pages.  Is it any wonder that it is selling on Amazon for a penny? Actually, I would not even pay that for a product that is as exciting as a bag of wet hair 
 Making this unprincipled betrayal of core American values all the more stinging is, by his own confession, his respectably working-class roots, where he grew up next to a gas station in a small New Jersey town. His modestly humble, unpretentious parents even admitted to the room-for-improvement in their lives when they moved to a bigger house from Randolph Street to Institute Street. Springsteen's parents understood the essence of Americanism in its promise of social mobility no matter your background--yet Springsteen spits on this sanctity like Kerry the Defeatist by equating ALL actions of America with tarnishes of "global hegemony", "colonialism", "might makes right", or whatever other socialist-menacing psychosis this unsatisfactory-educated "Boss" invents. Springsteen's been glaringly seduced by the entertainment community's leftist dictatorship and its mentally depraved, conspiring enforcement of herd-mentality that America's the "problem". 
 It's quite interesting when people describe this book as groundbreaking in learning sight seeing music.  I didn't feel the same way.  I understand that there are probably worse books, but this one reminded me my old musical school- I could play accordion but I never learned how to read notes.  This book didn't help much as well.  It's written in uninteresting manner in kind of boring monotony.  I would recommend books of Bruce Arnold on that particular subject, or any musical subject.  Quiet unorthodox teaching.  This book, on the other hand, just....disappointing.  I sent it back.    
 Well if you're expecting any kind of Something About Mary/Meet the Parents quality comedy, it aint here. Stiller and Aniston appear in this although I would like to think when they read the script (if they did?) they rejected it and were then offered more money than they could turn down.  Maybe Stiller has turned into another Adam Sandler thinking that him just being in the movie makes it a quality comedy, I hope not. Another animal oriented automatic laugh  producer falls flat with this time a ferret being the actor, which is an awful failure. Did I mention the atrocious "salsa" dancing bits? The only decent bit is Phillip Seymor Hoffman playing the sidekick to Stiller that still doesnt make up for the rest of the generic comedy witnessed here. This one was obviously shot out of the meatgrinder too quickly and it shows......Waste Of Talent for an hour and a half anyone? No, I thought not. 
 I'm a closet Christopher Cross fan -- and was eagerly awaiting the delivery of this CD.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  While the instrumentals are there, Cross's voice is long gone and he is so off key on many of the songs that it is shameful.  My wife made the comment many songs sound as if they are being peformed in a Karaoke bar.  We laughed aloud at many of the songs.... Do yourself a favor and buy the studio versions intead 
 I'm just launching a new magazine, so I have alot to learn.  I have read some terrific books; this is not one of them.  Basically the pictures are nice, but I honestly cannot think of one thing I learned from this book.  
 It's very good book in Probability and Statistics, a must-have for any researcher.  Book's Condition is bad. There're 2 pages severely scratched 
 I'm a big fan of Hooper's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series.  However, a FBI agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what I was expecting from a Kay Hooper book.  It was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided, and I found the Satan cult slant boring.   I think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books. 
 I love Marcia Muller's Sharon McCone books and have been reading them for years. But "Cape Perdido" was so bad I couldn't get through it. The characters are all stereotypes-- the aggressive, unfeminine local tree-hugger lady; the arrogant, chauvanistic, big-city lawyer; the sweet, idealistic community liaison intern; etc., etc. The only mystery was some oft-referenced, vague, long-ago "incident" that was never explained (at least not in the first 110 pages, which is where I got off the bus.) I don't know who wrote this book but I hope it wasn't REALLY Marcia Muller. I don't want to believe she would knowlingly publish such poor writing 
 If you own Elmo's world "singing and drawing," don't bother ordering this one. It is pretty much the same video 
 in the short story collection night shift, mr.king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least 6 movies that i know of(this mess,trucks( twice once by king as "maximam overdrive" and once as a t.v. movie),night surf,the boogyman(not the new one),graveyard shift,the mangler,and maybe more and not one has been done right! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve "he who walks behind the rows"     more like "we steped in something behind the rows" and we steped in this flameing piece of junk!!! skip it!!!!!! 
 This book is the worst of all the others  he tries to hard to explain and is ver difficult book to read i do not recomend it. 
 I was looking for information on penguins at a second grade reading level. This book was TOO easy and didn't give me details. It ws too simple and general 
 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 The producers of this movie should have titled it, "Squanto: How We Would Have Scripted His Life."  It took me a while to figure out fact from the fiction regarding Squanto's life.  Unfortunately, this movie not only skipped the facts, it added confusion to them.  Let us begin with the facts.  There was a Native American named Tisquantum, whom the Pilgrims called Squanto.  Squanto was tricked into going to England in 1605.  Squanto learned English during his stay in England.  Eventually Squanto returned to North America, in 1614, with a pair of English ships.  One of the two ships returned to England, leaving Squanto behind.  The remaining English captain kidnapped Squanto and twenty-six other Native Americans and took them to Spain to sell them as slaves.  Local friars in Spain discovered what was happening and took the Native Americans into custody with the intent of teaching them Christianity.  In 1618, Squanto boarded a ship bound for Newfoundland.  In Newfoundland, Squanto was recognized and taken back to England.  Squanto returned to North America in 1619 to aid in mapping the coast and in re-establishing trade with Native Americans.  Squanto learned that disease had destroyed his village, so he moved in with a neighboring tribe.  The following year the Pilgrims landed approximately at the site of Squanto's village.  Squanto helped the Pilgrims survive by teaching them how to find native fish and how to fertilize crops.  Eventually, Squanto abused his influence over the Pilgrims and manipulated the local tribes.  Massasoit, the local sachem, or high chief, asked the Pilgrims to turn Squanto over to him for execution.  Either fortunately or unfortunately, an English ship arrived, distracting everyone.  Before Massasoit could force the Pilgrims to turn Squanto over to Massasoit, he contracted a fever and died in 1622.  I think these are the basic facts of Squanto's life.  There are some minor disagreements between sources, but most sources seem to generally agree on the details above.  The movie seems to have mixed and matched facts to make a faster-paced, completely fictional story.  For example, we see Squanto kidnapped and taken to England, where he wrestles a bear.  Squanto escapes and encounters friars, who teach him English.  Squanto befriends a hawk, so we get a bit of mysticism in the story.  In case you had yet to notice, mysticism and Native Americans sells movies.  Squanto tricks his way back into the New World.  Squanto heads off to his village, only to find it gone.  Squanto then wanders about in the woods until he encounters another tribe and Pilgrims, about ready to kill each other off.  Fortunately, Squanto halts the bloodshed before it really gets started.  There is an incident in the movie where the son of a sachem is shot and a Pilgrim doctor saves the child and everyone lives happily ever after; or, as the epilogue tells us at the end of the movie, everyone lives happily for two generations until they forget the lesson of Squanto.  Squanto was a real person.  Squanto helped the Pilgrims.  Without Squanto, the Pilgrims likely would have all died in their first year in the New World.  Stick to those facts and you can hardly go wrong.  The movie went well beyond those facts, with a reinterpretation of history that borders on the absurd.  If you show your children this movie, warn them that this movie is completely fictional, except for the facts at the beginning of this paragraph.  You may also pose a problem for slightly older children.  Watch this movie and see how many historical errors you can find with library and internet research.  This movie is a possible object lesson to teach children that they should question the garbage that can go into a "historically inspired" movie.  This movie does do one thing well, and that is its general portrayal of Native Americans.  Much of what you see, minus the mysticism and some of the details, is relatively accurate.  Many of the actors are Native Americans (at least they got THAT right).  Had Disney used the same accuracy with the rest of the movie, they would have done fine.  I love movies that have high family values.  I love historically inspired movies.  However, this movie is beyond inspired and is a completely fictional version of a real human being's life.  Why Disney felt they had to go this far is beyond me.  Sure, Disney magnified and sanitized Davy Crockett's life, but at least Disney got the gist of Crockett's life correct and much of it was a bit tongue-in-cheek; Disney completely missed with Squanto.  Do yourself and your family a favor and avoid this movie. 
 Italian music from St. Laurent, Quebec Canada? I guess that is what one would expect. Sounds like a bunch of French-Canadian college students trying to audition in a faux-Italian bar. It is pretty bad. I don't know how they get "Gloria" as an Italian favorite. If you want Italian cafe music, don't buy this one. A waste of mone 
 Fukuyama trots out stereotypes that he must have picked up at his Japanese-Protestant father's knee, under a thick veneer of impenetrable sociological jargon that can fool the occasional reader into believing that this is an impartial scientist at work. Like all stereotypes, Fukuyama's are a blend of breathtaking overgeneralizations, and huge blind spots. And, like all stereotypes, they are utter nonsense.  The book attempts to update Max Weber's "Protestant ethic" story to include some non-Christian societies. The basic argument of the book is that Catholics are unable to trust people outside their immediate family, and so unable to form associations that are not based on family ties. The same is true of the Chinese, claims Fukuyama. These are the Catholics of the Orient.   The Japanese and Protestants are able to transcend family ties and therefore form a vast range of associations that do not have a genetic basis, especially large professionally managed corporations.   The feckless Catholics and Chinese however are doomed to form business enterprises that can never be more than over-grown Mom and Pop operations. Fukuyama therefore has a gloomy prognosis for the economic miracles of China or Taiwan or Singapore--however brilliant a businessman Pop may be, sooner or later descendants like Paris Hilton will be running the show.  There is an interesting chapter on Korea, where Fukuyama is at pains to show that however like wannabe Japanese/Protestants Korean business organizations may seem, they are really Chinese/Catholic at heart.  The book's thesis is obvious nonsense. Dramatic counter-examples exist, such as the Chinese Communist Party or the Jesuits. Also, the broad idea that Catholicism or Chinese-ness contributes to poverty lacks a statistical basis.   I saw a recent article about thousands of Japanese orphans in China who were taken in and looked after by Chinese families after Japan's World War II defeat. Rather surprising behavior in this "low-trust" society! Perhaps these Chinese had been somewhat civilized by the high-trust ways of the occupying Japanese 
 First of all the subtitle has been wrongly interpreted.  Some creationists have decided to use this title to expose Darwin as a racists.  He may be, I have not read "The Descent of Man" yet.  The origin of species talks very little of man.  It is a book of observations and study.  It concentrates on how plant life, has by selection, brought forth all the species we see today.  The survival of the fittest through millions of years by gradual change.  Darwin covers his beloved pigeons in depth.  I agree with him that all the different types of pigeons we see today probably came from one ancestor of the pigeon.  This is called variation of kind.  We see this in just about every living creature and flora.  The problem arises when the next step is taken, the rise of one species turning into another (reptile to bird).  Throughout the book Darwin does admit to this fact, but he still maintains that it must be, with much difficulty.   There is no doubt there is a tremendous amount of work that went into his book.  It is a difficult read.  I would rather have read the dictionary.  One does need to know his enemy.  Darwin is not the originator of "evolution."  There are many who came before him, since the dawn of time.  He was influenced by numerous men of his time, some being more radical.  Darwin was nothing new, he just made it "hip."  What he started has turned into the secular humanism the world had adopted.  I don't think he meant for this disease to spread like it has.  From his writings I understand him as an agnostic, but doubtful.  I believed he struggled with the possibly of a deist.  It is safe to say it was his only ambition till his dying day to prove "evolution" as proof of our existence.  What of the missing fossil record?, he new they would be found.  He was a confusing man.   150 years later and there still has been no intermediate fossils found to prove the case.  In fact we are discovering more that validates creation.   Wish you well, Scott                       
 i have read 208 pages and i am bored with this book. i don't think i can finish it 
 If you had no idea that the so-called quarterlife crisis existed and simply wanted to know that others are in your shoes, this book could be good for you.  If you knew about it, but wanted to read about others' experiences, you may enjoy this book.  If you wanted actual constructive advice about what to do and how to handle things that come up during this time of your life, this book will not be useful.  It's like the author simply interviewed 20-somethings and wanted to use every quote she got in her book, but never really thought it out beyond arranging the quotes into sensical chapters.  There's not really any useful advice for anyone going through their quarterlife crisis, which may be a tall order considering most people would probably experience it differently, but I really was disappointed by the book 
 This Movie takes a big flaming tird on the MK series I mean How could Ed Boon let them do this. This Movie suck's dont ever watch it. It has Power ranger fighting and the cast stinks. The First one is the best 
 I found this movie somewhat entertaining, although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun. Unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention, and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting, makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience. Nevertheless, the film is about a whole host of young people, dressed up and heading for a party (ostensibly Martha Plimpton's party), but they never quite make it there. Plimpton, someone I never really cared for, is actually rather funny in this role, and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party (and her idol, Elvis Costello). Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman are both quite funny; Courtney Love, Paul Rudd and Janeane Garofalo are also quite a trio. Overall this is light comedy; nothing special but still worth the effort. 
 Reading this book , one might conclude that only five things mattered to Paul Hornung: football, alcohol, women (perhaps sex with women is more accurate), gambling and nightclubs (and the entertainers and hoods who inhabited them).  As a window into the personality of a rather shallow and non-reflective human being, this book might be worthwhile.  On any other level, it is a failure.  It offers little insight into the game of football, it's evolution over the 50's and 60's, or the people who played it for Notre Dame or the Green Bay Packers.  (Instant Reply or Distant Replay are both far superior).  What kind of school was Notre Dame?  I can't remember any class even being mentioned?  Did Hornung appreciate the unique environment of professional football in a small town like Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Again, not a word.  	The book reads like a quickie done for pocket change.  Some of the factual errors are quite remarkable: Hornung states that Fred Williamson played for the Raiders and got "hammered" in Super Bowl II.  Wrong: he played for the Chiefs in Super Bowl I.  He states that Frank Gifford was on the original broadcast team for Monday Night Football.  Wrong: Gifford joined in the second season, replacing Keith Jackson.  One wonders if Hornung actually read the ghostwriter's script. 
 I love Tamia but this cd was a disappointment, I like maybe 2 tracks from the entire cd 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 The package the book came in was smashed. The book appeared as if it had been used. It took over 2 weeks for it to arrive. I wouldn't order any books from amazon agai 
 As a resident, This book clearly gives a wrong account of the lifes/thoughts of most residents/intrens.Very little of the screaming sexuality/irreverence is true especially in this day and age.Patients health are not taken this lightly and profesionalism is key and indeed emphasized.We now know why there was so many successful lawsuits in the 70's and 80's. However I am not surprised knowing the Author is a Psychiatrist and not in the aspect of medicine most people will ever get to see/experience. Psychiatrists tend to think a little bit off the curve. VERY FEW OF THE STORIES, SCENARIOS AND STATEMENTS AS TRUE OR EVEN POSSIBLE IN THIS DAY AND AGE. RECOMMENDATION: Not recommended reading.  
 I wanted to like this book, I really did. Afterall, I bought it, but... ugh. These beings are sooo smug and self-righteous, like the worst sort of priggish hellfire preacher cum self-important eco-activist. If you like pompous smug completely banal and unoriginal lectures that tell you how awful we all are and how we need to quit being individuals and become part of their hive mind group-think, well, you'll LOVE this book. If you have no sense of humor and are addicted to end of the world crisis melodrama or 'saved by the aliens from the good ship Marigold' crackpot gorp and think humanity is at present naught but parasites on the bum of poor suffering planet earth, you'll love this book. I have no idea if her aliens are real beings or not. If they are, they need to get a sense of humor and chill out, have a beer, quit being so stuck on themselves like they're the 'great white bwanas from space'. I mean really. :-P For more interesting, humorous and useful channeled chitchat try Pat Rodegast's Emmanuel books or Mary Margaret Moore's Bartholomew books. Those books are also far more enlightening, in all the best senses of the word :-) 
 I couldn't figure out if this was a novel or a liberal political op-ed piece.  Which is it Mr. Woods?    Two Dollar Bill pretty much follows Woods' imagination of the normal Stone Barrington agenda, with the inclusion of several underwritten and hidden political personal opinions.  Installing political opionions in his books have been common practice for Mr. Woods, I would know because I have read EVERY SINGLE ONE of his novels prior to Two Dollar Bill.    Political opinions are all fair and well...when incorporated into a politically focused novel, which this isn't by any means, but it would be hard to know it by the shear number of snide, unrelated, and personal attacks Woods makes concerning Bush Administation policies and general Conservatives in America.  To his credit, Woods did respond to an e-mail I sent him inquiring as to why he did this, but couldn't provide ANY justification for it.  Merely that it was his right to do so.  And you are correct Mr. Woods, it is your right to do so...just like it was my right to make the conscience decision not to read any more of your books, which I am happy to say that I haven't.  And coming from a person (me) who has ALL of your novels (with the exception of one) in hard back, most of which are signed, is quite a statement to make.  I've been a fan of yours since the early 90's, but cannon continue to be with your recent, and quite obvious, politically motivated agenda.  Good day to you 
 The cover of this DVD states that the available sound tracks are DOlby Digital 5.1 English and Japanese, and English and Japanese Stereo.  Alas the sound is only in DTS for Japanese.  I do not have DTS, so trying to listen to it produces a loud pop, then no sound whatsoever.  Very disappointing, to say the least.  NOw I'm forced to watch with English, which I NEVER do with non-English material.  Boo, hiss 
 With all respect to Mr. Hawking - this book should never been published. I'm not blaming him, but all others who are responsible it went to market.  Let me explain a little bit  Most of buyers of this book, are buying based on Hawking reputation from "Brief history of time" (which is excellent book). What we have here - pictures which doesn't have any relation with text (at least not valuable and are far to big - taking space in other words, you'll not buy book of 60 pages for 35 USD), changing from one subject to another, explaining the basic things somebody who is reading such a book should already know (spin - 2 pages) and then jumping to complicated things (M-theory - mentioned in 1 row) without explanation. Some jokes and comments I don't understand.  I bought this book 6 months age and came to approx 1/3 of book (poker between Hawking, Newton and I think Einstein). I didn't have nerves to read more ... this is first book in my life I didn't finish.  I never thought I'll write review, especially not like this and especially not for book of Mr. Hawking, but I felt cheated. There are so many other excellent books on same thematic, try them, forget this one.  But anyway, my 3 year old son was extremely happy by disintegrating this book to more then 1000 small pages ... lucky him.   
 If you search for the keyword 'Illuminator LED Flashlight', you'll find that this same item is offered from varies sources at wildly different prices. So naturally, you should just go for the lowest price, right? Not so fast...  I already bought one Illuminator flashlight elsewhere (see my "Customer Images' above), and was going to order a few more as gifts. The lowest price I found here is from 'IGgFactory Handhelditems' at $7.95. But during checkout, I found out that their standard shipping and handling fee is $8.21 for just one item. The flashlight itself weights only 7 oz., but the company charges 4 lb. for shipping weight. What a rip-off!  With such inflated shipping cost, you may be better off buying this item from local drug stores (such as Walgreen) for $15. At least there you can return the item easily if you're not happy with it.   [Update on Jan 21, 2007]: Please check out my review for the Garrity Power Lite, where I have made a comparison betweeen it and the Illuminator. It is my opinion that the Garrity is a better flashlight. 
 Jonathan Franzen is an accomplished writer. However, that doesn't stop this book from being a clunker. Having started and stopped several times, I finally got stuck at page 215 and have not had the energy or willpower to go further. His plot is bizarre and the characters arouse little sympathy; the prose does little to propel you on. I would recommend The Corrections for anyone intrigued by his style but unwilling to take a chance on this early poorly-received work of his 
 I watched both "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" and its documentary "Making of ..." and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers (particulary the incredible Tommy Rall).  Looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film I came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb, I decided to purchase the film.  Then I noticed the cover.  I thought "Is this what I think it is?", and clicked on 'see larger image'.  YIKES!  It is!  I have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational, to say the least (after just having placed "Hands Are Not For Hitting" on my wish list!).  If Warner Bros decides to change the illustration on the cover, then I'll consider buying it.  Until then, for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see, I suggest you view the 'see larger image' of the cover before you decide to buy 
 Sorry, but this geek is not jumping on the geekwagon.  Despite being sub'ed Adventures in Adolescence, many of the anecdotes actually deal with the author's pre-adolescent years, coming of age-olescence if you will, and frankly they are the funnier entries.  (But am I wrong to doubt that the author could really start having orgasmic experiences at age 7?) The biggest problem is that the germ obsession sets the author apart from the typical geek, who would have gladly braved a little [spoiler warning here] puke breath to make out with a cute girl, and way too many of the experiences described in the book deal with that phobia.  There are 2-3 laugh out loud passages, 6-8 cleverly turned phrases, but they don't make up for the laborious redundancies - Bill, we get it about the rope, enough with the "25 foot lover" references, the repeated return to the mincing descriptions, etc.  
 While this book contains limited basic information regarding solar design, it really is a house plan book.  Unless you are interested in buying her house plans, save your money 
 I gave a quick read of this. Not sure how to rate it. Motherhood and apple pie. Nothing earth shattering. Basics repeated. Prepare, dont loose cool, practise makes perfect. Now that's the secret sauce for a sucessful case interview according to the book. 
 This is a true waste of money, those who walk the left hand path may buy it for humor value, but that's pretty much it.  The author seems to be an imature, vain posseur who needs to never again put pen to paper 
 The last of four albums to appear during the first two years of the Valenti-era, "Comin' Thru" is QMS's weakest album ever, and it doesn't get any better with time. Cipollina, Freiberg, and Hopkins are all long gone, Duncan is erratic, and Dino seems to be daring the last of the faithful to join his many detractors. "Doin' Time" is a serviceable variant of the "Fresh Air" chord change, but the rest is either ugly or silly. An unfortunate entry that tarnishes Quicksilver's already inconsistent legacy 
 While the book contains tried-and-true tactics that will always work, it is outdated and not thorough enough.  No mention, for example, on dropshot, splitshot, or swimbait techniques.  Very brief mention of casting techniques, and nothing about pitching.  All of the B&W photos look like the fishermen were going to a screening of "Saturday Night Fever" once they got off the lake.  The book was "updated" by Mark Hicks, who never hesitates to include photos and stories of himself, a no-no in the unwritten rules of authors.  I should have spent my money on Roland Martin's or Van Dam's books.  
 After reading this iconic work, I felt as if I had been ripped off with only myself to blame.  I should have known better.  The book is SOOOOOOO 70's!  I'll give it two stars simply because it's really so out-of-date it's almost campy.    Okay, early oil paintings depicted the upper classes with their "stuff" and the "stuff" of the upper classes.  So?  It's pretty elemental to figure out that those painters had to make a living and they painted for those who were able to pay them.    Duh.  Okay, women were depicted in oil paintings as possessions and, in turn, viewed themselves in the light of the value the possessor placed on them.  Deep and enlightening, huh?  It gets worse.  We get a healthy dose of the "capitalism is bad" philosophy and the hammering that advertising is meant to keep the masses enslaved to capitalism.  Nineteen seventies style collectivism is so boring.  Of course, Berger offers no alternative other than some passing reference to his vague definition of democracy.      Maybe it's just so out-dated, it's no longer relevant.  Maybe it played better to the 1970's.  Maybe we've heard this claptrap for so many years, it's no longer novel or meaningful.  And, maybe, it's because we've matured enough to realize criticism without any offering of alternatives is simply disingenuous and superficial 
 I adored Mailer's Naked and the Dead, but I just ditched Harlot's Ghost without finishing it. For starters, Mailer was so ignorant that he wrote that schizophrenia was the name for multiple personality syndrome. In reality, those psychiatric conditions have nothing to do with each other, something Mailer would have learned if he had cared to create believable characters. Instead, he exploited his lazy ideas about schizophrenia to fashion a series of Deux ex machina events. The resulting plot is tiresomely simple: all his characters work for the CIA, they each have two personalities, therefore they can do anything whatsoever BECAUSE THEY ARE CRAZY, and this explains why the CIA sucks. Yawn.. 
 I went to the library with my 4 year old son and just grabbed the book. We have read Pinkerton stories and have always loved them and I didn't even look through the book or even much at the cover until that night when we settled in for night time stories. I then realized that there was a "robber" with a gun on the cover. I thought to myself, "How did I not see this before?" and by then it was too late. My son saw it and had a zillion questions so we read it. I was shocked by the content! We are very open with our son about anything he asks and I explained that yes, there are "robbers" and yes, people do get into dangerous situations like that. I felt very uncomfortable having to almost outright lie to him and tell him that, "No, noone will break into our house because we lock our doors, etc..." How else do you explain this to a 4 yo at bedtime?! We got through it and son loved the book. I thought it was very cute that Pinkerton was confused but could have done without the break in part. I feel it could have been as cute without that. Very irresponsible in a child's book, but I guess I learned a lesson to read the books before we check them out even when they are written by someone you consider "safe" 
 It's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick, clean, near-perfect minimalist thriller. It's not that much of the added material (particularly the internal affairs sub-plot) feels tacked-on and unnecessary. It's not even that Pacino's character is a toned-down shell of the dangerously off-kilter detective of the original, that one of the more complicated characters (Frya Selmer/Tanya Francke) has been reduced down to set dressing, or that the ending ruins the film's moral atmosphere. It's the fact that Nolan, a sublimely talented director, is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads. Pacino does the method-acting bit again, taking it over the top in every single scene; Hilary Swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down-to-earth hometown girl; and Robin Williams--well, he's Robin Williams. The kids in this film, Katharine Isabelle and Jonathan Jackson, turn in fine performances that, while hardly career-makers (which they couldn't be, considering how far their roles have been pared down), are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries' mugging. See the film for their far-too-short performances, but make sure you rent it, and don't pay too much to do so 
 It's a great description of the Spritual Cure.... but we never analyze what was wrong in the first place... it's a type of Narcissism which in her case comes into conflict with her religious values and forced her to develop her spritual walk as a cure.   And it's a good cure, often overlooked because we neglect to name the Beast thats at the core.So the spiritual cure goes untried 
 I usually love JAK books but this book was the dullest book I have ever read. It took me a month to read it when I usually read her books it a 3-5 hour session. I think the reason I did not like it was there was in my opinion too much detail about the dream levels and the heroines family/friends were not likeable. I also think the book missed her trademark sense of humor 
 I'm sorry to vent on the Stylistics, certainly others are guilty of this, but $33 to get all the Stylistics hits is WAY too expensive.  Sorry, love the Stylistics, and the Spinners too (whose double CD anthology is around $30 too).  Why is something like Lionel Richie and the Commodores 2CD Gold $13.99?  Oh well... I'll wait 
 Having read over 20 biographies of TR over the years, I would have to say that this is the worst. The author utterly fails to assess TR in his "context", though she claims that this is her intent. She judges TR based on modern, "politically correct" sensibilities, and, naturally, finds him wanting. This book is more appropriate as required reading in the Women's Studies department at Wellesley College than for a student of history or devotee of TR 
 i read this book on advice of a friend, so i finished it.  but i didn't find this book gripping or inspirational.  i didn't have sympathy for any of the characters and the writing was bloated.  while i was reading i found my mind wandering and didn't feel a need to go back and read paragraphs or sentences i missed while wandering.  the characters are somewhat true to life in that they are total environmental hypocrites, but the book didn't present this as something to work on avoiding. overall a long read that just made me realize why so many people hate tree huggers 
 I agree wholeheartedly with Kenneth Ryan's review.  This book was "recommended" reading in one of my English classes at UCLA several years ago, and I bought it, but just now picked it up for a read.  The problem is that the main character is so vapid that I simply did not CARE what happened to her.  It has always been my firm belief that one must identify with, care about, or even despise a main character to care enough to keep reading.  This novel was painful to finish; who cares what happens to these people?  I agree that whatever "splash" the book made in its day came from the shock value it would have had because of the amorality of its characters.  It's hard to shock us these days, and the book is now just plain uninteresting 
 I was very disappointed in the book which I received as a Christmas gift. I, too, dislike the light yellow print which is a strain on older eyes! It is difficult to find the recipe on the page because of it.  This might seem trivial to some; but, to others it is a real pain.  Also, the recipes are nothing special.  I am glad that I did not pay for this book 
 A totally contrived and badly written book.  I found it hard to believe that this was written be a professional writer.  Based on the television series, which is actually interesting and fun to watch, this book suffers by comparison.  No character development whatsoever, stilted dialogue, stock characters.  Don't bother with this knock-off of Kathy Reich's wonderful series 
 Aldiss has created a very interesting world but there is not much of a plot in this first book.  The book seems to be a setup for the subsequent books in the series which I have not read yet.  The book is mostly about how the humans on Helliconia cope with the severe change to their environment as Helliconia moves out of its long cold winter into spring.  Due to a simultaneous change in leadership, they are challenged to adjust socially and economically in order to survive.  They are threatened within by their own internal petty politics and without by the aboriginal Phagors who have always hate humans and by other  humans who are their sworn enemies and wish to kill or enslave them.  They must deal with a new age of enlightment which is at odds with their traditional ways of thinking.  Blindly following their religion is questioned.  On top of all this, they also must deal with a devastating plague that threatens to wipe them from the face of Helliconia.  All this is watched by a group of anthropologists from old Earth who do not interfere.  The assumption is that this is an old Earth colony which has fallen back to the stone age due to Helliconia's severe winter thousands of years ago.  These watchers add some clarification to what is going on on Helliconia.  Whether they play any significant role remains to be seen.      
 Upon testing this antenna I soon noted the signal strength significantly weaker both for transmittiny and recievin 
 Where's the subtitle of this very effective book?  Did the modern editors simply take it away?  Darwin titled his book: "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" and subtitled it: "The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."  When Hitler came to power in 1933, he had one overarching idea in mind: his radical Nazi racial philosophy built on the Darwinian principle of natural selection.  Hilter thought the Aryans were the fittest and he wanted to help speed up the "inevitability" of natural selection.  He first started off with the sterilization of nine categories of "the unfit" which were feebleminded, schizophrenia, manic depression, Huntington's chorea, epilepsy, hereditary body deformities, deafness, hereditary blindness and alcoholism.  He then worked his way up to attempting the complete extermination of entire categories and entire races of people.  Speaking of modern day little Hitlers, the Columbine High School shooters carried out their bloody rampage on Hilter's birthday, April 20th, and had planned on causing more than 500 deaths at the high school.  Shooter Eric Harris had written on his website, "YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE??? Natural SELECTION!  It's the best thing that ever happened to the Earth.  Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms."  After the bloody rampage, Harris' autopsy report revealed that he was wearing a T-shirt with the words "Natural Selection" emblazoned on the front.  Beware of those who hold this book dear to their hearts.  This book is not about man descending from the apes.  The ideas in this book have caused and continue to cause more deaths than any other notion in modern history 
 Many of the reviews I read felt strongly in favor of this remake, but some of the people had not seen "An Affair to Remember".  Cary Grant & Deborah Kerr had the spark so lacking in this "Love Affair" remake.  The original "Love Affair" with (forgive me, I can only remember Irene Dunne as Terry, and my opinion that film was not as good as this "Love Affair", however. I missed hearing the original scoring of "An Affair to Remember", but Annette Benning's music with the children was lovely.  As most of the reviews that stated they were in favor of "An Affair...", I missed the climactic ending with Cary Grant's reactions, and also the shipboard scene where he want's to be "worthy of her love".    I don't wish to underrate or "dump" on this film, but I wish all reviewers would watch the Grant/Kerr version just once.  I believe they will become "old movie buffs" too.  Thanks for reading my review 
 Unspeakably awful in every respect.  The peak of suspense is when someone comes into the courtroom who may have been about to assault him (but wasn't and didn't) and the height of lawyering comes when he mangles Blackstone to mourn the change from common law to statute law. Nobody who isn't compelled to should read this boo 
 Well, I was hoping for something with some relevant information on Rune use in the pre-Christian era.  What this is, however, is yet another mash-up of Norse Magic (Conway), Northern Magic (Thorsson), Northern Mysteries and Magick (Aswynn) and Rites of Odin (Fitch). Which are total fabrications of the worst kind in describing the religious and spiritual practices of pre-Christian Scandinavians.  If you're into revisionist religion practice, this may appeal to you, as it has no basis in the actual spiritual or worship in the pre-Christian era there, and therefore you need never to explain it as "connected" or "factual".  This book asserts to give historical facts, myths and misconceptions and provide you with a basic factual foundation of rune knowledge.  It does not one of these things, relying on the worst sort of pseudo history, outright fiction and reversionary romantic theory's of the past two decades of pop Viking culture popular on the disenchanted fringe of the pagan mainstream.  It bears no relationship at all to proven historic facts, artifacts, or written references of the time in question.  Sorry I bought it, the only high point is taking that book out of circulation - much like a Southern Baptist tract. 
 I bought this book because there were several glowing reviews of its content.  The suggestions in this book are not creative at all!!  I am not creative by nature, but I had thought of most of  the ideas listed here.  There are sections by age, but each section is small and you could do all of the items in one weekend.  The songs and rhymes were the only thing of value in the book.  Thumbs down 
 I like Ringo's work in the "March To..." series and I liked Williamson's "Freehold", so when I saw they had combined in a new book, I put that on my to-buy list.  I waited until the paperback came out, bought it, and happily sat down to read it.  Unfortunately, the book didn't live up to my own mental hype.  This book is apparently a continuation of a series involving something known as the Posleen War.  Not having read any books involving that before, I went into this book cold, and I am coming out the same way.  There is only a cursory description of the variously cultural entities that are at odds with one another, and no real emotional reason given as to why one is supposed to be better than the other.  The bad guys seem to to be something called the Blobs, but since that gave me the mental image of a moving scoop of green Jello, I found it hard to work up an interest in them, or to care about them one way or the other.  The basic plot is a group of commandos land on a planet to recon a suspected enemy base, which they do without incident or much dramatic tension.  On the way back, they find an alien artifact from an extinct, highly-advanced civilization, that would be worth "billions".  This artifact is basically a Hitchcockian "maguffin" - something everyone is pursuing but that really doesn't have any significance to the story.  We never really learn in detail what exactly the thing is, what is does, how it works, etc., and in the end it is immaterial.  Greed arises, compatriots are killed, and three are left to try to rendezvous with the escape craft, one of whom has the artifact.  Pick any WWII movie and you can place the three remaining stereotyped characters:  the psychopathic sniper, the determined outsider, and the loyal "kid".  The story centers mainly around Dagger (the sniper) and Tirdal (the alien Darhel) and their mental battle with each other as Dagger pursues Tirdal a la "The Most Dangerous Game", with the character Ferret pursuing them both, trying to figure out what's going on and who to side with.  Ferret was actually the most sympathetic character out of the three.  Dagger was just a textbook psycho and bully, while Tirdal, who is the hero, is never really emotionally accessible.  I knew that I was supposed to care about him but I could only manage a lukewarm interest.  Basically this book consists of a geographical tour of whatever planet it is they are on and their hostile encounters with the local fauna, which are giant bugs.  Everyone takes potshots at each other, with various wounds accumulating.  The one you expect to die first does, the bad guy fails, the hero wins.  Tah-dah.  The book left me dissatisfied.  It would have worked much better as either a short story or a novella.  The novel format was just too long because the action, once the group was narrowed down to just the three characters, was simply repetitive.  Except for a few quirks, there was really very little development of Tirdal in the context of why being a Darhel among humans was so culturally odd.  I wanted better explanations of the players and the situations.  I kept wondering what the point of the whole story was, and I never quite got an answer to that one.  
 I suspect the text was actually designed to inefficiently convey ideas.  I cant believe someone has not written a student guide to fill in the holes for all the subtle leaps, overwhich students are expected to understand and apply 
 Each year, I dig into the works of a classic children's writer. Eleanor Estes caught my attention because her novels, many published 60 years or more ago, have recently been reissued. This one has terrific illustrations by Louis Slobodkin, a huge talent in his own arena. The story here is simple, which may be obvious, but I'm fascinated by how something so basic becomes so beloved. The writer's style is skilled and serviceable, but there's nothing magical about the language (as with E.B. White). The dated material is occasionally offputting. The main characters are so thinly sketched as to be cliche. And the true payoff, the reality of the "hundred dresses," is almost thrown away. Is the childhood memory of a beloved book what makes it a classic 
 I can not believe that this debate is going on.  These zealots need to climb out from under their rock and step into the real world.  Hello, FICTION.  You, people, do remember the word, I hope.  The Harry Potter series is wonderfully written and opens up the imagination and gets the kids out from the television and video games.  Come on people, kids are only kids once.  God isn't going to strike you dead for reading them and the devil isn't going to invade your children for reading them either.  Get over this stupid idotic idea that this is unholy 
 I'm not going to say I'm a long-time Death Cab fan, but my fondness for the band has led me through their entire catalogue, from Transatlanticism all the way back to You Can Play These Songs With Chords, my personal favorite being We Have The Facts... I tend to prefer lo-fi indie rock, though the sheer strength of Death Cab's songwriting kept me a fan up through Trans.   A lot of people will think I'm ridiculous for saying that this is Death Cab's worst batch of songs ever. Sure, the lyrics for Follow You Into The Dark flow perfectly from one line to the next and are even visually vivid, but it doesn't even sound like Ben Gibbard is trying anymore. It's the distillation of all the clever word-play he's been perfecting over the years, and this is the pinnacle, except the key ingredient - emotional conviction - is noticably absent. That seems to be the best way for me to describe Plans - perfectly clever and absolutely predictable songs that rely on studio polish instead of sincerity.  This is fiction, not fact, for the first time in years.   It's a trait noticable down to the CD cover. Something About Airplanes comes with a textured CD book with holes punched through so you can see the subsequent pages, where-as Plans comes with a glossy, plasticy booklet. It's an entirely different aesthetic at work than on the previous albums that seemed so uniquely vulnerable.   To be fair, there's only one other person I know who detests this album like I do, so odds are, if you're reading this review, you will in fact enjoy Plans. My guess is that most Death Cab fans have already purchased this and made up their minds, or have decided to steer clear altogether. If you heard DCfC on the radio, it's more than likely that big studio productions don't grate on your nerves the way they do on me, so you probably won't have the same qualms with the album I do. I just had to throw in my two cents and hope that some of you will check out Death Cab's earlier work, because this is far far far from their best. And if "lo-fi" scares you, check out The Photo Album. It's a good example of polished integrity 
 Even with the questionable veracity, I enjoyed Frey's first book, A Million Little Pieces, since it stayed true to an addict's experience.  Leonard, on the other hand, came off as pure fantasy, with very little substance.  Even the description of Frey's struggle was too contrived to be believable.  It was not even interesting as fiction. 
 This is a sickingly incipid "book," a complete waste of time. This so called writer should not be allowed in print 
 First of all, I must disagree that log(x) is poor notation for ln(x)... mathematicians use both (in fact sometimes log(x) is log-base-2 of x... frequent in computer science!).  This book is good in that it does things from such an elementary level that even those who've forgotten their high-school algebra will be able to follow it.  He's very very gentle in his exposition (tedious perhaps for those who know this stuff already).  And I LIKE the numbers taken out to 20 decimal places... it's neat!  The main complaint that I have with this book is that the author is WAY WAY too in-your-face throughout.  A good author tells a story from behind a curtain.  Derbyshire _constantly_ reminds you he is there: there are stories of his kids, his wife, his father-in-law.  He talks about his own schooling several times.  And (very annoying) he constantly writes in the first person.  Sample, "I will now show you a trick to make this more understandable."  This implies to me that he is the inventor of the trick (whereas he is almost NEVER the inventor: he's using it without crediting the true inventor and the reader is left wondering who discovered these methods!).    The more common way to write about math is to include the reader: instead of "I will now show you, the lowly uneducated reader how do to this" you say "we will now explore a way to solve the problem."  You see: "we" instead of "I, me, my" all the time.  To reinforce the Derbyshire-ness of the experience, he includes other Derbyful experiences as well.  For example, in the center we see photos of some of the greatest mathematical minds of all time: Gauss, Euler, Riemann, and... Derbyshire.  Later in the book, when explaining Landau's big-O notation, he needs a name for a function that he's discussing.  What would you call it?  f()?  func()?  He calls it the "Derbyshire function".  I found all of this so annoying that it was hard to read the book.  If you aren't bothered by the author's complete self-absorption, you will probably find the book a nice read 
 Using frozen fruit to make up to 4 smoothies every day, our family is hard on blenders.    After more than a year of daily experience with the Waring Pro (both MBB* & PBB* models) I cannot recommend them for serious smoothing making.  Here's why:  Both glass- & stainless-jug models use the same blade assembly.  This blade assembly wears poorly when asked to blend frozen fruit.  It fails often, and must be rebuilt or replaced.  Parts are easily purchased if you're handy and have the correct tools.  DETAILS: The assembly screws together, and is threaded to tighten under use rather than loosen and fall apart.  But this tightening action is so great when the blade contacts frozen fruit, that it bends the metal washer below the blade.  The assembly eventually becomes so tight that the shaft cannot turn.  The Waring Pro is all the blender than many people will need, but is not sufficient for the daily maker of multiple smoothies 
 I found 23 factual errors in Honan's book -- when I mentioned this to someone I was told that a reader in Virginia had found 142.  There are much better biographies of Jane Austen out there -- for starters, no one has yet surpassed Elizabeth Jenkins', first published in the 1930s, and a fine recent one, a good introduction to JA's life, is Maggie Lane's latest, Jane Austen's World.  Don't be put off by the fact that it is slick and, as they say, richly illustrated -- it's readable, sound and remarkably complete despite its size 
 I encountered this wildly overpraised critical study in college. I've should have known I was getting into trouble just by the stupid title. Hoffman's attempts at humor are lame (Camille Paglia is far more livlier  and insightful on Poe in her book "Sexual Personae")and his  insights pitiful (Paul Coates, in "The Realist Fantasy", gives a  much more subtle reading of Poe's "William Wilson" in just three  paragraphs than Hoffman is able to accomplish). What really undermines the  whole book is Hoffman's complete ignorance of fantastic literature which I  think would be essential to doing a critical study of Poe. Only passing  mention is made of E.T.A. Hoffmann, a major influence on Poe (and among  other great writers). Consequently the influence of Hoffmann's doppelganger  tales (such as "The Double" and "Devil's Elixirs") on  Poe's doppelganger tales ("William Wilson" and "The Black  Cat" among other tales)and their influence on such short story writers  as Borges, Paul Bowles, and Julio Cortazar, is not mentioned because Daniel  Hoffman is ignorant of it all and the whole genre. And his conclusion that  Poe only wrote "pure" tales devoid of any inner meaning is pure  bunk and pure laziness on Hoffman's part. To any unfortunate reader or  student who picks up Hoffman's book expecting any critical acumen be  warned: this book isn't it. Two other critical studies (David Ketterer, J.  Gerald Kennedy) are far better 
 It is because of this book and the other books James Fetzer wrote with his dishonest pack, that people have lost so much interest in the JFK Assassination. Honest authors like Harold Weisberg and David Wrone attract less attention because they only published what they could prove and not what they dream up. The Z-film was altered, many know this, the Warren Commission published it in volume 18 (18H1-84) with frames missing. In case you don't know this, that counts as alteration. Z-film tampering was not to the extent that Fetzer claims such as painting Jackie's face on the film itself. The film was not stolen, or doctored up in anyway. No one would be dumb enough to take that risk 
 I normally don't write reviews but I just read this book and I couldn't believe how much of a waste of money it was. Here's the book in a nutshell- Hire good employees and fire bad ones 
 I bought this book to try to learn some useful poses for my subjects, and given most other people's ratings, I decided to give it a try.  However, upon opening the book my first thought was, "these all look like high school yearbook photos", which is exacltly what they are.  It seems that that's primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market.  His main concern, which he stresses throughout the book, is creating a "saleable picture", and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom, since she's usually the one with final say over the pictures.  A better title for this book would have been, "How To Take High School Senior Pictures".  Even then, most of the pictures are not very good, both in their original execution and in their print quality for this book. In addition, the poses are unnatural and awkward looking, and the book is filled with typos and grammatical errors.  To be fair, the author does suggest some useful basics of things to do and things not to do when posing a subject, but there is really very little useful information here.  So, if you're interested in learning how to take pictures that look like a Sears portrait, this may be the book for you.  However, if you really want to learn some useful techniques for posing your subjects in a more natural or more artistic manner, I'd steer clear of this book 
 I love a dark comedy more than the next person, and laugh at things that I probably really shouldn't.  So I thought this movie, hyped as a very dark comedy, would be right up my alley.  Sadly, apart from a few moments here and there, "Very Bad Things" simply fails as a comedy.  And it fails as a drama, because every single character is unlikeable and unsympathetic.  That's too bad, because the actors are fantastic and do their best with the material given to them.  I fault the script, which has problems at best, and the direction and editing, which give the movie a strangely languid character at inopportune times.  You could do worse, but this is strictly a rental at best.  
 Unless you enjoy movies that are not funny, not scary, and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns, DO NOT WATCH this series of horrible flicks.  Putrid!  Not even "so-bad-it's-funny". Absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind!  Heed my warning!  SUCKS!! 
 Having read six books on this exact subject in the past week, I feel information is poorly presented in this one.  Sometimes misleading, and sometimes even contradictory.    I highly suggest that you read other books and/or papers on the subject before braving this one.  Even then, take this read with a grain of agenda-salt 
 This story is one of the worst "fantasy" stories ever.  It is completely unoriginal and is a hodge podge of borrowed fantasy and mythological creatures set in a preachy judeo-christian story line.  Don't waste your time with the books or the movies and look to Lord of The Rings or Harry Potter for original (not to mention secular) fantasy and escape.  
 Based on other reviews I expected great things. What I got was a book written in the 20s which has never been updated. The quotes from other works are in French or other languages without translation. There is nothing here that has not been covered by newer works in greater detail 
 This is a great album.  However, I had the same problem as another reviewer. The disc I received had very poor sound quality-- you could only hear music from one side of the headphones or from one speaker no matter what listening device was used.    
 I had always meant to get around to Eric Alterman's "What Liberal Media?" but had never had that wonderful intersection of a public library close by and the chance to waste my time on some stupid reading.  Well, I finally got both and enjoyed Alterman's book so much I began searching for other liberal reading on the subject and stumbled onto "Tailgunner" Joe Conason's "Big Lies."  I actually know little about Tailgunner Joe.  During the Clinton years of course I knew him as a propagandist for the White House, a reliable shill because of a lack of formal connection to the Clintonistas.  His best-known book is "The Hunting of the President," in which Clinton is portrayed as someone sort of walking down the street minding his own business when he's suddenly mugged by a bunch of right-wing thugs.  Definitely an "alt-history" novel.  To properly understand Big Lies, you've got to start off putting yourself into Tailgunner Joe's mindset to get an idea of what he thinks "liberal" and "conservative" mean in the first place.  If the man thinks that NPR is "politically balanced" (p 47), that ought to tell you something about his understanding of what is mainstream.  Now, as for the book itself.  The big lies start early and often, with comments like "Conservatives enjoy their virtual monopoly over the nation's political conversation...because -- unlike the supposedly mainstream media -- conservatives are perfectly willing to stifle opposition" (p 1) and "the most basic liberal values are political equality and economic opportunity" (p 2) and "liberals...regard the freedoms enumerated in the Bill of Rights as essential to the expression of popular consent" (pp 2-3).  The only thing stifled was my laughter when I read these passages.  For example, when's the last time a liberal defended the second amendment, or the ninth, or the tenth?  However, the book doesn't continue on that vein for long.  Big Lies is not so much an expos on the vast right-wing propaganda machine, but rather an extensive political tract of, to paraphrase Orwell, "conservatives b-a-a-a-d, liberals g-o-o-o-d."  It's similar to the Al Franken-Michael Moore-Molly Ivans books you see in the bargain bin at Barnes and Noble.  Most of the book (pp 53-212) is a rehash of the supposed sins of Republicans in general (the Depression, deficits, Iran-Contra, hypocrisy, overall meanness for cutting taxes for the rich, etc. etc.) and George W. Bush (Harkin Energy, Enron, TANG, Carlyle Group, cutting taxes for the rich, etc, etc,).  Tailgunner Joe even goes so far as to say that liberals fought the Revolution and to free the slaves, while conservatives were Tories and slavers (pp 69-70).  I'm not joking.  Admittedly, Tailgunner Joe does have some good points about the mainstream media and its political leanings.  He claims, for example, that more newspapers endorsed Bush in 2000 than Gore, including more major dailies (pp 39-40).  I found that surprising.  Assuming it's true.  He also claimed Lexis-Nexus searches reveal less, or no, labeling bias like that claimed by Bernard Goldberg (p 33).  I was surprised by that as well.  Assuming it's true.  But the book is weighed down by its errors.  Tailgunner Joe is a much better writer than Eric Alterman, but like Eric, Joe has a troubled relationship with facts.  When he's slinging mud, he's pretty good, because, after all, whether Rush Limbaugh is "xenophobic" (p 23) or the religious right is "openly hostile to the nation's traditional ideals of liberty" (p 96) or President Bush's political philosophy is "un-American" (p 184) is a matter of opinion.  But when Joe makes reference to actual facts, well, that's where he runs into problems.  Here are a few examples.  *  "survey evidence...suggests that Americans are still more liberal than conservative" (p 4).  Tailgunner Joe references the polls of the National Election Studies Guide to back up this claim (p 213), but a review of the actual polls he cites show conservatives consistently outpolling liberals (35% to 23% in the most recent survey).  You have to ask yourself whether Joe thought his audience would be too stupid or too lazy to actually verify his claims.  He probably thought we were both.  Meanwhile, according to the August 2004 Battleground poll, 60% of Americans considered themselves "very conservative" or "somewhat conservative" while only 35% considered themselves "very liberal" or "somewhat liberal."  *  "No conservative presidential candidate has won a majority of the popular vote since 1988" (p 7).  Now I suppose we can forgive Tailgunner Joe for this since he wrote his Big Lies in 2003, before Bush won re-election with 51% of the popular vote, but it does cast some doubt on his analytical abilities and his conclusions, does it not?  *  "But the conservative press would never publish a liberal equivalent to George Will" (p 50).  In response, two words: Al Hunt.  * Max Cleland is a "Medal of Honor winner" (p 67).  First, one does not "win" a Medal of Honor, one is *awarded* or *receives* the Medal of Honor.  See, e.g., 38 U.S.C. 1560(b).  But I suppose I shouldn't quibble with Tailgunner Joe trying to comprehend military parlance; it's foreign territory to him and he's doing the best he can.  Second, Max Cleland is not a recipient of the Medal of Honor, but rather the Silver Star.  There's a world of difference between the two.  To get the Silver Star about all you have to do is shoot a fleeing foreigner in the back.  To be awarded the Medal of Honor takes extreme bravery.  There's also the matter of distortions.  Big Lies is full of them, so I'll confine myself to some of the most obvious.  *  Most Washington-based journalists "identify their own politics as `centrist'" (p 40).  That may be true, but it's also true that *three times* as many journalists identify themselves as liberal as conservative (54% self-identify as "moderate," 22% as liberal and 7% as conservative; Pew Research Center poll, May 2004).  Taking that fact in, and that fact that journalists in general probably want to maintain the fiction of political neutrality, it's no surprise that a majority of journalists claim to be "moderate."  *  "Journalists generally reflect the same spectrum of viewpoints as any other group of college-educated, upper-middle-income, urban and suburban Americans" (p 41).  Assuming that's true, and assuming that this voting group is liberal (and it is, particularly in NYC, Washington and L.A., where the most influential journalists live), does that not disprove Joe's entire sub-thesis of "there's no mainstream liberal media"?  *  Tailgunner Joe finds it mystifying that John Ashcroft would be anointed in a manner "imitating the behavior of...ancient Hebrew kings" (p 99).  Let me help Joe out of his intellectual box.  A commandment to anoint is given to all saints in the New Testament, specifically James 5:14, when the Christian needs a blessing of health. (Aside: I had a liberal Jewish friend comment about this anointing to me in 2001.   My response: "Mark, what do you think of a vice-presidential candidate who, for religious reasons, one day a week cannot flip on a light switch?"  As you might imagine, that was the end of *that* conversation).  *  Terry McAuliffe's miraculous stock trade with Global Crossing is acceptable because Terry "did nothing illegal" (p 153), but Tailgunner Joe has no problem smearing the actions of Republicans involved in Enron (pp 149-152), even though they did nothing illegal either.  It's good to see an enunciation of a moral standard from a liberal, even a Klintonesque, legalistic one, but now if he'd stop being such a hypocrite by applying shifting standards to his enemies.  *  Tailgunner Joe constantly complains about right-wing buzz-phrases like "compassionate conservative" (p 177) and maybe he's got a point, but he indulges in the worst sort of left-wing clichd buzz-phrases himself, like "working families" (p 188).  What -- a "working family" has to be a family where both parents work?  Do all the kids have to work too?  Do the infants?  Does the family dog?  Give me a freakin' break.  *  There was "no lack of zeal" in Clinton's hunt for bin Laden (p 205).  Like the zeal in turning down the opportunity -- twice -- to kill or capture him in the mid-90s?  Tailgunner Joe has a peculiar definition of "zeal."  Sort of like Clinton's definition of "alone."  *  "Stringent anti-terrorism legislation" when proposed by Clinton is good (p 207) but when proposed by George Bush it is helping create a "nascent military regime" (p 102).  So read Big Lies for a few slivers of actual fact, and a few chuckles, and as a case study on use of invective.  But don't read it thinking your going to get an expos on the vast right-wing media conspiracy.  Tailgunner Joe Conason turned out to be a lot like that other Tailgunner Joe: fighting a rearguard action against real and imaginary enemies, to questionable effect 
 I read this book because my mother and father, a career soldier, were married shortly before World War II, after knowing each other only 3 months. I hoped this book would offer me some interesting insights. But trust me, this book has no insights to offer. The vignettes are too short and most seem incomplete; further, they are repetitious and shallow, and the whole book is poorly written. Do not waste your time. Instead, spend it finding one of the really good books on WWII; there are plenty out there. Larry King must be spreading himself too thin these days 
 The Third edition has been out since 2004 so there isn't any need to still purchase the second edition unless you can get it cheaper 
 This book is WAY past its pull date.  Full of warnings about not calling back the unrecognized number on your pager (pager?), the ease of using a consumer-grade scanner to evesdrop your cell phone calls (not since the cell network went digital!), and how you should shred paperwork with identifying information on it (duh!).  The over-riding assumption is that anyone with something to hide must be a criminal.  The reader is told to vary your hours, commute route, and habits so 'they' can't catch you, because you must be trying to get away with something.  For the rest of us law-abiding types, the message is "privacy is obsolete.  get over it."  Even worse, the author and the ghost-writer (this is one of those books by someone WITH someone else) must have been paid by the word.  It goes on and on and on, just to convey the merest morsel of a factoid.  But worst of all, the author is such a big shot, you're supposed to be really impressed with the names he drops and the James Bond-style exploits he pulled.  He walked right into office buildings after-hours and stole bags of trash!  He staked out the parking lot of the YMCA residence and guessed that the only non-hoopty in the lot belonged to the embezzeler!  He shoulder-surfed the old man in line in front of him at the bank to learn his identity!  Shaken-not-stirred stuff, you bet!  I have a lot of books on my shelf, and I don't mind reading a lot of pages to get a little information.  But this turkey yielded NO information of use, and so it went right back in the box and back to Amazon.  
 American Juniors are just wannabe's of S Club 8! They take their songs, and sing them horribly! They also took some S Club 7 songs. American Juniors can't even BEGIN to compare themselves to S Club 7. These kids have some potential, but they really need to get their own music. Check out S Club 8/S Club Juniors and S Club 7 for the original songs, which are actually performed well 
 This product is horrifying. It worked for three months, at which point it experienced a complete meltdown. Started getting Auto-Protect errors, and suddenly could access the internet with Explorer, but not Firefox. It kept trying to send me to Live Update, which wouldn't work, so I uninstalled and reinstalled Norton. Now the error happened again, and I could access the internet with Firefox, but not Explorer. An error message referred me to an online "fix," but -- guess what! -- you can't access any of their fixes with Firefox. You MUST be using Explorer. (Which is, in and of itself, offensive and obnoxious.) Explorer, of course, wasn't working. (Incidentally, with Norton uninstalled, all worked fine, so that was indeed the source of the problem.) Uninstalled and reinstalled Norton again, hoping to get on Explorer and get the fix before the error recurred, but now I couldn't get on the internet AT ALL. At that point, I uninstalled Norton for good. Ditto on the fact that they don't support the product, apparently don't stand behind the product, and apparently aren't very concerned about their reputation. Very disappointing. Previous versions were just fine; this is a complete mess 
 The Blu-ray Disc is supposed to have 5 times more memory than standard DVD. So why can't they release ALL the special features (and more if possible) that the standard DVD has? I don't know if it's a product, copyright, or money issue, but this hasn't yet happened on HD DVD. The standard DVD of this movie has full-length audio commentary, 15 minutes of extended fight sequences with optional commentary, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a storyboard-to-film comparison, and a sneak peek at the Making Of the second "Transporter." None of that is on this Blu-ray. So if you're a real movie buff and like special features, get the Standard DVD of this movie 
 This book is truly outdated, don't bother to read it. Today it does not add anything to brand management. Most articles concentrate on arguments against line extensions but do it in a superficial way. It is easy to read but very light and almost totally commonsensical. The only part that I like in the book was the case of a shampoo that lagged appeal over time on which a couple of experts offered different solutions. This demonstrates what students often don't understand about case teaching: That there is no single "solution".     
 Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say "Bad! Bad author!"  This is one of those books.   Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to "hip up" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history.   Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass.   And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much 
 I bought this book reading the good reviews and with hope that I will get the needed knowledge about Spring framework. Although in some modules (IOC, AOP) the book is quite good and explains well the concepts, it lacks the concrete examples. The method used to explain the most complicated concepts makes them hard to understand without any other source of information. I found a lot of unnecessary information while the book lacks the necessary explanations sometimes 
 MY DAUGHTER IS TWO AND WE HAVE BOUGHT MOST OF THE "POTTY" BOOKS, BUT THIS ONE IS MY LEAST FAVORITE.  THIS BOOK MAY BE FINE FOR AN OLDER  CHILD WHO IS LEARNING ABOUT HIS OR HER BODY, BUT FOR A TODDLER WHO IS  TOILET TRAINING.  MY CHILD LOST INTEREST IN THIS BOOK ON THE THIRD PAGE.  I  AM A FAN OF THE WHAT TO EXPECT SERIES, AND I HAD HOPED FOR AN EQUALLY GOOD  CHILDREN'S SERIES, BUT SADLY THAT WAS NOT TO BE 
 I can barely feel the heater when I'm laying right next to it.  I expected much better from Sharper Image 
 Will Smith was at his best in the late-80's and early 90's when he and his partner made breezy songs reminiscing about summertime and how their parents "just don't understand." Sure, it was always quite hokey and goofy, but it was still sweet, which I think added to Will's likability. After Will left the set of his television show, he went on to star in big-budget action films. He even made a decent comeback album in 1997. "Gettin' Jiggy" and "Miami" were two excellent singles. Of course, in 1997, everyone (myself included) thought Will could do no wrong. Then this stinker was dropped on the world. I think it's safe to say that Will Smith's career has burnt out. He certainly can't redeem himself from this mess of an album. First off, if you're going to title your album with a play on your name and the millennium, it'd better be the most amazing thing I've ever heard. And surprise, it ain't. Overcompensation comes to mind. You know "Willenium" is a stinker the second you see the song titles. Will actually included the title song from his first bomb of a movie: Wild Wild West. The best way I can describe the song is that it's a ripoff of his "Men in Black," song, which is also was a ripoff of another song from another artist. Speaking of ripoffs, lets move on to "Will2K". Now, I know sampling has always been used in rap, but in this day and age, rappers nearly commit thievery (thank the Gods this is all Will Smith has committed). Will practically did a remake of the Clash's "Rock the Casbah", and yet he still tried to take the credit by calling it "Will2K". But the worst thing about this album is that Will's lack of skills as a rapper and lyricist are painfully clear. When someone titles one of their songs "Uhhh", you know there's something going on that's more serious than writer's block.  
 The Freedom potty trainer looked like such a good idea, but the plastic is very flimsy, and when set in place, it just barely reaches the floor. It's a pretty unstable situation. A separate kids toilet seat and footstool would be far better 
 The article that the author originally published appears as an appendix in this book reprinted in 1988.  Although the author is to be lauded for his breakthrough in the field, the book itself is mostly light fluff about the history of the area with the meat of the text in the appendices with the original articles.  Most of what is in this book can be found on the Internet in about 10 seconds with a good search engine looking for stonehenge astronomical alignments 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks.... 
 Billy Joel's career was built around an image of himself as the "young rebel" fighting against traditional American prejudices and bringing in the ideas of the "young".   Well, now that Billy Joel himself is older than most of the people in the "older" generation, even if he were to come back to rock and roll he would look rather ridiculous. I doubt if the effect could ever be the same.  Well, perhaps it might be! Mick Jagger is still singing about partying in the streets of New York (changing values) and he is old enough to be the grandfather of the kids who are partying in the streets of New York. Jagger is even older than the President.  Perhaps the old people of today really can jump up and rebel against the older generation. . . but which older generation? The one that's now dead?  As to Billy Joel. Billy Joel was one of the greatest in his day. His music had power and influence that rocked the world. Like the paintings of Leonardo Da Vinci, his artistry will be ageless. His music will be listended to even five centuries from now.  But although the music is ageless, the man who made the music unfortunately is not. It is my opinion that when one becomes a certain age, it's time for him to admit he is no longer a member of the younger generation rebeling against the old. He IS the older generation now. Sadly, it's time for Billy Joel to pass the torch to someone else. 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 I loved every Elizabeth Peters book I had ever read until this one. She is one of my favorite authors and I am a huge King Arthur fan. My expectations were high. The book was horrible. The plot was loose and the writing was like a bad romance novel. The only good parts were the descriptions of the towns and sights in the Enlgish countryside. From the copywrite this must be one of Ms. Peters early books. She should be ashamed to leave it in print. This is the only book that I ever bought that was so disapointing that it made me angry that I had spent money on it.  (For some reason following this review it says it is for the audio version of th book only.  I have never listened to the audio version.  This is referencing the actual written book. 
 As an agnostic, I eagerly approached Surprised by Joy expecting to have my beliefs (or lack thereof) challenged by someone sympathetic to my point of view. After all, I thought, Lewis was once an atheist.  Surely, he'll gently guide me to the Christian path that he himself followed.  In this I was greatly disappointed.  The book is neither a true autobiography nor a rigorous Christian apology and sadly, rather than using his considerable talents to persuade atheists and agnostics to his way of thinking, he frequently resorts to disrespectful, even scornful attacks on non-believers that are sure to offend and alienate them.  Moreover, his arguments are written not for a layperson but for someone well-versed in philosophy and literature.  And even with all the scholarship he brings to the table, in the end, he resorts to his gut feeling rather than rational discourse when explaining why he decided to convert.  In the beginning of the book, Lewis tells us quite a bit about his early childhood and formative experiences.  His story becomes increasingly sketchy as he ages.   Although his life was certainly filled with dramatic events, such as the death of his mother and his combat experiences during WWI, his accounts of these events are vague and seem strangely devoid of emotion. Other life experiences that most people would consider important and relevant - the death of his father, for example - are barely even mentioned and are dismissed as having no bearing on the story Lewis is telling.  One always has the sense of being held at arm's length in this book. We are invited into Lewis's mind but rarely into his heart.      What is left, then, is an extremely cerebral life story.  Lewis writes endlessly about his education, the books he's read and the influence they had on him as well as the brilliant young men (and it's nearly always men) who befriended him over the course of his life and made him re-evaluate his thoughts and beliefs.  All well and good.    But when he actually comes to his conversion, I'm afraid it's difficult to follow his train of thought.  Lewis clearly expects his reader to be as erudite and well-read as he is.  Sadly, that isn't the case for me, nor I suspect, is it true for most modern readers.  I am not a student of philosophy and I am woefully ignorant of English literature.  All his references to these topics, therefore, were entirely over my head.    Still, it's clear that an element of the irrational creeps into his arguments for rejecting old ways of thinking.  For example, when Lewis senses a certain inconsistency in his own beliefs and the tenets of realism, he's must decide whether to reject realism altogether or embrace Behavioristic theory.  He chooses the former not for any clear objective reason but because, as he writes, "I cannot force my thoughts into that shape any more than I can scratch my ear with my big toe..."  I suppose I could give the same reason for my lack of faith.  In fact, it isn't a reason at all.     Lewis would have us believe he was a very reluctant convert.  Perhaps he was.  But once converted, he clearly had very little patience for those whose views he once shared.  He explains this with a quote from Donne: "The heresies that men leave are hated most."  He goes on to add, "The things I assert most vigorously are those that I resisted long and accepted late."    To be fair, Lewis retains respect for an atheist called Kirk who played an essential role in his education.  But he doesn't extend that respect to other atheists:  "Atheism has come down in the world since those days, and mixed itself with politics and learned to dabble in dirt...I am ashamed that my old mates and (which matters much more) Kirk's old mates should have sunk to what they are now.  It was different then..."  Ah yes.  Somehow, when Lewis himself was an atheist, that particular way of thinking was far more respectable than after he converted.  I suppose he would have nothing but contempt for atheists and agnostics today.  I don't mean to sound bitter but I really expected something much better from this book.  I honestly hoped I would like it.  I didn't.  His reasoning, though bolstered by a veritable library of books, is unconvincing.  His life story, though intellectually compelling, is an emotional desert.  As I read it, I kept wondering, What of love?  And anger? And sadness?  And passion?  Doesn't he feel anything at all?  Even his description of Joy is oppressively unemotional.  Was Lewis really so unfeeling?  The Chronicles of Narnia suggest otherwise.  In short, the book was not to my taste but I suspect it was never meant to be.  Lewis seems to be preaching to the choir, not reaching out to sinners.  Those religious types out there who already adore C.S. Lewis should, no doubt, disregard my opinions on Surprised by Joy - I'm sure they, at least, will love it.  But for those non-believers out there half hoping to be converted by Lewis's words I can only say it didn 't do it for me 
 First of all, if you know anything at all about encryption, computer security, and things like that, the technical stuff in this book will have you laughing.  Dan Brown obviously didn't research the topic, or decided to rely on public ignorance.  That's not a slam on the public, though.  Cryptography, computer security, and the like are not trivial subjects.  Still, he clearly didn't know what is and isn't possible, and in several cases his attempt to define technical jargon was just plain wrong.  The major characters in the story were extremely shallow and stereotypical.  What saved it character-wise was all the minor characters, who were somewhat interesting.  The locations and event descriptions were also good, and helped you envision what was happening.  Technical and character issues aside, the overall storyline, while somewhat entertaining, was not even remotely plausible.  The climax of the story was outright laughable.  You have a bunch of genius techies and codebreakers trying to figure something out that is blatantly obvious to anyone with any math/science/technology background, but the ideas they run through are what you would see from "average Joe".  No problem if these were average Joes, but they weren't.  So, I guess if you have nothing better to do and don't expect much realism or technical accuracy, I guess its as good a way to kill time as any 
 I did not like this audio book.  Out of all of Danielle Steel audio books this one was the worse and most depressing story. In a world of finding a new job and starting to date again. It was a story of a women who was having a problem finding the right man.  It tells you a sad story of the man who used her and the man who was afraid to commit himself to another woman long after his wife died and he tryed to started to date again. 
 This disc is too spotty as a disco comp for me to consider it truly representative of the best music of the disco ball and platform shoes era. While the best material("Le Freak", "Disco Inferno","Love Machine","In the Navy","Heart of Glass") exemplify what this SHOULD be, other songs are either mediocre ("Get Up and Boogie","Could it Be Magic?"), or else not really representative of the disco era/sound. ("Ladies Night" is NOT disco...even if it is a nice 'club' song. Neither is a REMIXED version of "You're the One that I want"..which wasn't disco to begin with regardless of vintage.)  I would say this is the nadir of the "Pure Disco" series..this one's only for diehards. (And if you're THAT into disco, Rhino has a good series you may prefer instead..7 CDs..called "The Disco Years" which goes beyond the huge hits and recalls some ones that are now forgotten..)  2 1/2 star 
 This book is very poor to be used for A+. The flow of sentense in the main text book is not organized well. The author puts too much verbose, unnecessary, words to explain objects; what is that light-minded, lazy description about USB? As well, the book is not technically witten; it even does not differenciate Low, Full, and High speed mode of USB. What is worse is that the optional book "Practice Questions" has full of wrong answer keys as you can see in the other customer reviews. I am very discouraged reading this book because of errors the book contains. The next time the author edits the A+ book, I wish him and co-workers to re-read the contents several times with experts and technical writers 
 I just tried to use Albert Goldman's "The Lives of John Lennon" to find a fact about John Lennon. I heard Lennon's "Rock'n'Roll" album, and thought it was oretty good, overall, so I wondered who'd played on it. I checked Goldman's book. After all, in a 719 page biography of a musician you should be able to find information about his music, like who played on his albums.   But Goldman only mentioned Jesse Ed Davis, on guitar. I flipped backwards and forwards trying to find another smidgen of musical fact. Instead I found this: "Perhaps the most revealing moment in John's relationship with Jagger had come on their joint appearance on the Rock'n'Roll Circus, when a stoned John, playing a TV interviewer, had done a satiric turn with Mick as pop star, that concluded with John slipping his hand inside Mick's shirt and feeling him up."   That's funny, I thought. I'd just played the DVD of "Rock and Roll Circus", and I never noticed that. So I played the Lennon sequence again. The hand in shirt thing still didn't happen. Seems Goldman had an agenda (claiming Lennon was gay), so he made it up. When Goldman wrote, "Rock'n'Roll Circus" was hard to find; he probably didn't expect that marketing and technology would one day make it easy for people to check little things like that.   I'm no longer confident in claims made by Goldman that stand unsupported by other biographers. Did Lennon take a metric ton of heroin, and make an absolute tool of himself during "The Lost Weekend"? Yep, I believe that, because other biographers confirm it. But did Lennon (for example) kill a man in Hamburg, or go to bed with Brian Epstein, or do a voodoo trip to the Caribbean? Did Yoko arrange for Paul's drug bust in Japan? Nah. Get away with you, Mr Goldman. Only Goldman tells me so, and he offers only malicious hearsay, sometimes filled out by his own imagination, not evidence.   My scepticism isn't because I think Lennon was a saint. It seems that the real, historical, John Lennon could be a right bastard, angry, violent, including to women, and a mean drunk. It also seems that the historical John Lennon could be funny and kind and thoughtful. He could tell terrible lies, and be awkwardly honest. He was a bit of a mess, in fact, though he tried to sort out his mess. And historical evidence suggests that a lot of people who were close to him loved him. Not fans. Not "staff". Friends and family. Which suggests that there was more to the man than the sum of his faults.   But Goldman doesn't give us this human complexity, but a hatchet job of no more than fair to moderate reliability on matters of fact. The real problem is not so much that his most sensational claims don't stand up. It's more that the whole portrait is out of register. Goldman mainly portrays Lennon not as a bastard but as a dweeb, a pitiful, weak, loser, stupid, gullible, characterless schlemiel. It's not the details, but the basic picture that simply fails to ring true.   It's hard to present yourself as witty, cocky, sharp, sharp-tongued and astute, in interview after interview over many years, also in private with observer after observer, and for 15 or so years solid with three guys who know you better than anyone else, unless wit, cockiness, sharpness, and astuteness are actually a large part of your nature. It's easy to fake stupid, but hard to fake intelligent.   We know too much about what Lennon was like, from other sources, to believe in Goldman's Lennon. Goldman's Lennon is a wet slug, who could never have made any records.   In a sense Goldman's Lennon doesn't make music, since Goldman avoids the topic as much as possible. The single most important thing about Lennon is that he was a musician, but this book is useless on Lennon's music. Goldman doesn't provide the most rudimentary information about its creation. And if a biography of a musician doesn't do that, what's the point of it?   Not that Goldman's musical judgements inspire confidence. Goldman's Lennon was too incapacitated to make music at the time the real Lennon made the superb "Walls and Bridges" album, so Goldman simply dismisses what the record clearly demonstrates. But Goldman reaches true weirdness with his claim that Lennon couldn't play guitar, but faked it all the way through the Beatles and his solo career.   But had Goldman ever listened to a Beatles record, he'd have noticed that there was a good drummer, a brilliant bass player, a limited lead guitar player and an occasionally powerful rhythm guitar player. That last player was Lennon; there were only four of them, for heaven's sake. From the opening chords of "I wanna hold your hand" to the driving riff of "Yer Blues" - on "Rock and Roll Circus" you can watch Lennon playing rock guitar on "Yer Blues", not disgracing himself in company with Eric Clapton and Keith Richard - Lennon could create riffs and drive a band along, as he once described the rhythm guitar player's job. He was also a good acoustic guitar player, on songs like "You've got to hide your love away" and "Working Class Hero".   I guess Goldman had come to so dislike his Lennon that he was prepared to say any old thing about that literary character. With hindsight, it now seems amazing that a book that contained the guitar claim got taken seriously. Goldman stepped out of serious biography and into "Paul is dead" conspiracy theory territory.   So here's this big fat book about Lennon. It was probably useful, in a way and in its day, for debunking the idealised portrait of Lennon the martyred saint. But can you use it as a source of factual information about Lennon's life and music? Basically, no. No, you can't. It's no use, for that.    Laon 
 Being Swiss, I know how what normal wear and tear is on a racelette oven. The oven itself is great, and the little pans are made of good non stick material. The top grill however is of very very poor quality. The coating was starting to chip, in addition to bubbles forming on the surface just after a couple of uses. I do NOT recommend this grill if you want to be grilling on top.  
 The book has a good start. You get to install the necessary components and applications which went very easy. But at teaching yourself J2EE in 21 days this book fails. You get the big picture about J2EE and so on however you don't learn to implement it and program it yourself. Everything is being approached by there Agency applicatoin which I lacked feeling with. Allmost every chapter/day is being explained by a piece of there big Agent application which to me is a bad approach. Many times you see some code of about 2 pages but you can't code it yourself because it's not intended to deploy that code. It's just a part of there application with what they want to explain something.. in which they fail to me. Looking at someones unintersting and dry code intended to learn from it, made me allmost fell asleep some times. I stopt reading it after day 6. Maybe this book can be used as a reference book later on however if you want to learn programming J2EE applications with it, my advise is to look for something else 
 This is a good yarn ruined !     The subtitle of the book is, "The true story of the 1938 Nazi expedition into Tibet".    If the author had limited himself to this he might have had a winner on his hands, but sadly for the reader it didn't work out that way.    The actual story of Schafer's expedition could have been told in less than 200 pages, but Hale pads it out to over 500 pages, with so much extraneous material that book becomes frankly boring.     The book is full of adjectives which show that the book is not really objective, but is a tour de force of Hales own opinions.   As an example, whether you agree with her or not, Savitri Devi's books do not deserve the epithet "repellent" !  Odd perhaps, but not repellent.   Hale's book is also full of petty (and not so petty !) errors of fact and figure which call into question the thoroughness of his own research.  For instance, on page 53 he misnames Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.   Also in several places, despite describing himself in one part of the book as a "British journalist", he makes that so American mistake of confusing Britain with England, as on page 231 where he says, "Hitler calculated that France and England wanted to avoid war".    He repeats this confusion in several places.  On page 440, he says, "After September 1939 no-one in the German High Command could predict the outcome of a war with England".  Mr. Hale, Germany was never at war with England !   The war was with Britain, of which England is just one part.     It was noticeable too that some of the more lurid "quotes" in the last part of the book lack references to show where they came from, like Beger on Jewish female bottoms on page 489.   This detracts from the authenticity of such remarks.  The last 100 pages or so of the book have absolutely nothing to do with the 1938 Nazi Expedition into Tibet, but are yet another reiteration of the sins of Germany in World War 2, and I suspect this was put in purely to make the book politically correct and ensure publication.  In sum, this could have been a very interesting book if Hale had stuck to the subject in hand.  It does shine through in places when the actual expedition is being written about, but the rest of the book is so dull that the good parts are overshadowed.    I was left with the abiding impression that the boring parts one and two were only there as an excuse for the politically correct part three.   All three parts were so full or errors, minor and major, that the book is useless as a research tool, and it is so dull that it is not even a good yarn.  Shame really, but I suppose it might be a cure for insomnia ! 
 This book is very poor and I would recommend against purchasing it. This guide is seems to be written by seminar teachers, full of simple one-liners and cheesy analogies that don't really add that much to your understanding of strategy. Possibly a starter guide, but not recommended if you have already read anything on strategy 
 This novel seemed like a rush job. The characters are so prolific that you barely get to know who's who - is it human, animal or hunting history being shared. Too much to sort out and too little meat to make it worth it

 I am a great fan of Mr. Thom's work. I typically scour the shelves for his books.  However I found this one below his usual standards.  I did not get the impression his research was as thorough this time. Towards the end, the  story dragged.  I found myself finishing the book merely to bring it to  closure. I still highly recommend Mr. Thom's other works to friends. But  this book will definitely not be on the by-name list 
 This is not a natural peanut butter.  The listed ingredients are peanuts, sugar, palm oil and salt.  Natural peanut butter, such as Smucker's and Whole Foods contain only peanuts and salt.  Palm oil is not a healty oil and is not recommended for cholesterol patients.  
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 I have a 3.2 ghz, 2 GB, PC, clearly ready for Vista.  After running the compatibility wizard and uninstalling all the software that would conflict (even the optional conflicts the second time around), they told me it would install, yet, it didn't.  After an hour of installing, it tells me the installation fails and restores XP.  I realise that mine is an isolated case, but it's typical Microsoft.  If you want something that works, buy a Mac 
 It is not easy to fathom what exactly is wrong with this novel.  Some reviewers complained about the constant pop culture references, unintelligible unless you have watched a lot of TV, but this is just a minor point: people who do not watch television often may miss the full edge of the puns, but they will still understand that they are faced with a pun. Other reviewers seem to be complaining about the explicit slash content, the main character, Tony, being explicitly gay. To those I can only say:"Grow up!" Nobody has to agree perforce to homosexuality in the fiction one reads, but if one does not, it would be best to simply say so, not making excuses. After all gay readers, up to a couple of years ago, had to relate perforce to straight characters only. I make a point of always saying if a book I read has gay content so that those unwilling to face it can skip it.  Back to the book.  Characters are likeable, a little sketchy, but this being an entertainment series one supposes they will get more depth along the way. One supposes, but still a little more depth... more attention to Tony's heartaches for example, to Henry's scruples?  The TV setting is allright, full of possibilities and potential.  In my opinion it is the script which sucks (hey, read a couple of Tony's lines and you will slang yourself silly before you realise it). Whole paragraphs at a time are unfinished, clumsy. This makes the reading more difficult, less enjoyable, slow. You do not want slow when reading fantasy, unless it is gorgeous writing. There being many other paragraphs perfectly good one has to suppose a lack of concentration, hurry or both.  Ms Huff is a successful writer. How many children -if any of course- does she have to send to college that she cannot take more time to spend on reviewing? 
 I'm shocked to see that these books are still selling today.  I had this exact book when I was little, and my mother brought the old copy to me cause she thought my daughter might like to have it.  I don't think I'm going to bother giving it to her.  I was frightened by this book when I was little.  Mother Goose looks more like a wicked witch, stealing a baby, on the cover.  There are tons of nursery rhymes, but most of them are very obscure, some only a couple lines long.  And maybe I am reading too much into them, but a lot of them seem full of sexual innuendo and possible drug references.  One titled "Robin and Richard" seems the most questionable, about two grown men staying in bed until 10 o'clock.  I'm not prejudiced at all, but this seems like a very strange rhyme for children to be reading.  Everything about this book is disturbing to me.  
 Una interpretacin absolutamente falaz tanto de la historia como de la filosofa poltica. Un sinsentido que lamentablemente ha tenido enorme repercusin en la formulacin de polticas desde el imperio hacia la "periferia". Un deseo de teleologa desde la imposicin del poder. En fin, hay que leerlo slo para rerse un rato con tanto absurdo. 
 This machine is totally a waste of time, you would never ever make a pasta in 15 minutes, you would make the pasta in 4-5 hours.  The mesurements of the flours and eggs would never make the appropiate mixture. After lossing your 5 hours to make the mixture, you get the second problem, the mix would not get in the hole so the pasta can get the form you want b/c is to dry for the mixture to go down that hole.  If you want fresh pasta you are better off buying a manual machine and do it your self, or better yet go to the supermarket and they would have fresh pasta on the fridge. 
 I liked the first Green Day work - it was original, a bit too punky and whitetrash for me, but decent to listen too.  After dropping VERY large money for the last two albums I realized I was buying the same music just repackaged.  Even the Live versions on Foot In mouth sound exactly the same.  Save your money; either buy one of the first 2-3 albums of theirs or better yet, try something new 
 Purely a means to describe his own accomplishments without offering real information on improving basic skill 
 The material quickly goes astray claiming that "the primary path to greatness in the social sectors is not to be become more like a business."  Collins manages that conclusion through a non-sequitor - stating that basics such as personnel selection, demanding results, etc. don't count "because poor companies don't do those either."  Regardless, while Collins does identify the NYPD as an example of a well-run social-sector organization, his coverage is less than superficial.  Similarly, while Collins admits that social sectors often have a problem getting rid of unsatisfactory performers, he doesn't seem to appreciate how important that is.  American public education and healthcare are the two biggest social sectors, and both perform poorly while costing more/client than that of any other nation.  Public education costs have escalated far faster than the CPI in general (while pupil achievement and dropout rates have stagnated), and healthcare costs rise faster than most anything else - despite repeated evidence that basic treatment steps are frequently omitted or performed poorly, millions lack healthcare access, and Americans' outcomes lag those of a number of nations.    Part of the problem is that both sectors are heavily funded by third-parties (thus appearing "free" to users); another is the lack of good outcome measures; a third is that neither sector strongly links provider success with pupil/patient outcomes - in fact, both sectors generally achieve more income the worse their clients' outcomes.  My "Bottom-Line:"  The two largest American social sector components need enormous improvement; this is best accomplished through providing incentives for them to act more like businesses - Collins' point of view notwithstanding 
 And if you're not into comics, you won't care. What was Ronin Ro on?   Aside from glaring proofreading mistakes (on the same page, we are told that Kirby was stationed at an army base in 1945 and honorably discharged in 1943), this writer decides to take one of the most interesting and argued-about subjects in popular culture and present it as one continuous, here's-what-happened narrative, without ever citing his sources. No pictures, no index, nothing's ever sourced, corroborated or contested. Not only are conflicting versions of events never explored, but neither are the various other books and magazines Ro cribbed from ever cited. Hack-work, through and through.  If I sound angry, it's because this should have been great, at least as absorbing as Gerard Jones's excellent book, Men of Tomorrow. A good version of this book can be done, and I'd gladly shell out hardcover money for it.  Instead, it's like standing in a comics store, listening to some fool blather on, thinking to yourself, "you don't know that. How can anybody know that? Who told you that? You made that up," and finally, "just ring me up and let me out of here. 
 This is a book by JA Jance?  This book took a potentially good storyline (plot) and made it seem stupid because it was so simplistic in its writing style, which is UNLIKE JA Jance.  This book seemed to be to be written for a young-adult reader audience.   I had to force myself to read it all the way through because I must admit, I was curious as to the conclusion, but I did not derive any pleasure from reading this book.  A waste of time 
 The author speaks of incredible global structures based on "white privilege" and thus reveals his work as complete and total medicine showmanship. This book could have been worthwhile as a laugh, but it is not well written enough and therefore comes across as garbage instead. The author pretends to speak on behalf of all white people, thereby exposing himself as as big of a charlatan as those like Jesse Jackson who claim to be able to speak for all of black people. This book is not even worth the sales tax or the shipping 
 Hideous, absolutely hideous.  This is a ghastly two color print of what must have been a beautiful technicolor original.  From now on, I'll be sure to read the customer reviews before buying anything.  The sound is terrible also.  This disc is going back but fast 
 I have bought this book hoping to write a secure web page but I could get more advice search the microsoft web page than the book. Not recommended if you r writing for the web 
 Total Control started really-really well for this reader (nice premise/set-up). It had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). The last third of the book imploded as I was pleading for lead character Sydney to get "done in" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. Nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. Baldacci let me down on this one 
 This is a sprawling, lazy account. It was moderately useful as a complement to Donald Prater's far more concentrated 'A ringing glass', but if I hadn't read that book first I wouldn't have formed much of a picture of Rilke's life. There are a few interesting stories found here which don't  appear in the other book, but on the whole it is totally inferior 
 Broke after two uses.  Not worth the time to put back together 
 This book is just plain TRASH and Lies! If the TRUTH is what you seek 'Nature's Eternal Religion' by:Ben Klassen is the book you for you 
 I'm not particularly a Gore supporter but in my opinion this is a "hatchet job," done with a dull, rusty hatchet.  Not worth the read; surely not worth the price.  I give it one star only because there is no provision for giving it none...or "negative" stars.  I'm sorry I bought this, didn't check it out of the library, wasted the money 
 I recently saw this book on the bargain bin.  This book was pure garbage, by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits.  Basically they are saying valuations don't matter.  Since they wrote the book, it has been prooven that their philosophy, approached over the long term, produces some great damaging losses.  The book may be useful during the next bubble, which if history serves, will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky.  To the dungeon with these two knaves 
 IF YOU WANT TO BREAK YOUR LEASE THIS IS THE CD TO PLAY LOUD. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT RESEMBLES MUSIC GO ELSEWHERE. I DON'T MIND NOISE-ROCK WHEN THEIR IS A SEMBLENCE OF RIFF OR MELODY{SONIC YOUTH, BIG BLACK, DON CABALLERO}, BUT THIS IS JUST A WASTE OF PLASTIC. I EXPECTED MUCH BETTER FROM THESE MUSICIANS 
 Enriquez' format - short, declarative sentences and quotes, makes for a fractured text that is aggravating and sometimes hard to assimilate.  On the other hand, he does bring up a number of important trends (the U.S., with its massive, growing debt, is becoming increasingly vulnerable to currency speculators and the political and economic whims of other nations; economic problems within the U.S. create stresses and fractures along various socio-economic lines; the growing polarization along political lines; religion's increasing negative role - eg. impeding scientific thought, dominating debate on issues that should not be in the mainstream political thought; and the growth of U.S. population via those with very little education and few skills).  However, his focus on the fact that states may realign their future borders does not strike me as a key issue for the U.S. (or Canada), and his solutions to illegal immigration and the loss of American jobs are of little, if any value.  Similarly, his thoughts and recommendations on refomring education seem oblivious to reality - eg. its been tried for at least three decades, with no success; further, improving education in itself is of little value without also addressing the fact that Asian IQs average about 10 points over that of Caucasians, and the Chinese and Indians are paid only 5 - 10% of Americans.  After making an initial positive impression the book just descends further and further into meaningless blather - a point here, and an idea there, with no pretense (or hope) of an overall effective strategy, other than his simplistic over-focus on national unity and the transitory nature of borders 
 Well, I guess I should've read more reviews of this DVD. It is STRICTLY for beginners. I don't sweat and my heart rate barely goes up (if I do breath of fire it helps). When I want an easy day I'll pop this in and do both sessions. Very simple. But I'm sure it's good for a beginner--a BEGINNING BEGINNER. Sara Ivanhoe is soothing though, and encouraging. But seriously, this is a very easy workout 
 This is supposed to be a romance?  In whose world are rape, slavery, humiliation and other abuses romantic?  This is disgusting.  Someone mentioned they "like the fact that they simply didn't just fall in bed together and live happily ever after".  Does this mean they liked the fact that he raped and humiliated her? Or was it her being whipped that was so much better?  If I wanted to read about abuse and slavery I'll re-read ROOTS.  At least it is well written.  When I want to escape with a feel good, funny, romantic book I'll read a romance - just not one from this author 
 The content is good, but these aren't actually flash cards. It's a bound book with very thin pages and two words to each page. Studying with flashcards is best done by testing one's self with cards, slipping failures back into the deck for near-term review, and setting repeated successes aside. This isn't possible with a book. 
 This was a piece of junk. Trust me dont buy it!! Biggestt disapointment ever! If a dumb company will make a dvd of this trash why cant they make one for Howard the Duck? 
 The most surprising aspect of this 2006 thrill ride of a movie is that at ninety minutes, it is almost a half-hour shorter than its 1972 predecessor, a blessing really given that director Wolfgang Peterson seems only interested in filming the action sequences. An inspired choice for the remake, the veteran director has already proven a sharp acumen for providing exceedingly cramped, seafaring adventures with his classic WWII submarine movie, "Das Boot" and the more recent fishing trip-gone-wrong, "The Perfect Storm". The offsetting problem, however, is that Mark Protosevich's trite screenplay abbreviates character development in favor of banal dialogue and stock responses. The net result is that there is little concern for the fate of any of the characters, especially the women who look interchangeable when soaked, no matter how dire the consequences.  Peterson wastes little time, barely fifteen minutes, in setting up the ten key characters for the big tidal wave. From that point, he combines predictably spectacular CGI effects with outsized set pieces to dramatize the familiar journey this group takes to find their way to the hull where they seek safety. The one indisputable improvement over the original is the way Peterson effectively shows the fast elevating water level in a more realistic way, especially in having the characters swim a lot more through the submerged air shafts. Less realistic is the way all the characters appear to swim at Olympian levels in their ability to forego oxygen for lengthy periods. But the set-up gets repetitive, and the only diversion, albeit a minor one, is figuring out which character will be killed next.  As the alpha male, Josh Lucas cuts a reasonable action figure playing the Gene Hackman hero role though a more mercenary type given that his character is a professional gambler. Relegated to second lead, Kurt Russell seems to be inheriting Ernest Borgnine's role but not as a blowhard cop but as the sensitive former mayor of New York (huh?). They argue periodically about what path to take, but that's the only relationship that has any semblance to reality in the film. With no one as colorful as Shelley Winters or Stella Stevens this time, the rest of the actors barely register, including wide-eyed Emmy Rossum playing Russell's conflicted daughter and Jacinda Barrett as the brave mother of a predictably precocious son.  The biggest waste is the normally colorful Richard Dreyfuss cast rather pathetically as a gay, suicidal architect who barely says a word once the action starts. The climax gets quite convoluted in its technicalities, and then it simply ends. There are nine minutes of end credits at the end listing the multitudes who worked on the special effects. The two-disc 2006 DVD is strictly for aficionados of this genre of film with several "making of" featurettes and a History Channel documentary which looks at the possibility of such waves wreaking such havoc. Surprisingly, there is little reference to the 1972 inspiration directed by Ronald Neame. And consequntly, there is barely enough to hold interest over the course of two discs. An unmemorable viewing experience overall 
 I have been a Diana Krall fan for years. Have all her albums and play them regularly. I felt however that her heart simply was not in this album. The album lacked energy. Just to be sure, I gave it to another DK afficianado and she agreed with me. I trust that this is a career hiccup and not a trend 
 This is yet another cookie cutter writing book. Very little in this volume was new to me and the author's attitude toward certain types of writing, such as contemporary literary fiction, was more than a little insulting. Perhaps he can include a chapter called "Don't Insult Your Readers" in the next edition.  If you've never read a writing book before, this one has some practical advice in it, but you can get this type of information elsewhere 
 When I was first chosen to narrate this book, I knew nothing of the racist past of its author -- I knew only that it was the single worst book I'd ever been assigned.  The negative AudioFile Magazine review of the recording (quoted here on Amazon) is completely fair.  Reading the book to myself in order to prepare to record it, I found it annoying in the extreme -- the so-called prose is precious and poorly written, and the allegedly authentic colloquialisms are grating.  When it came time to say it all aloud, for the first time ever (and I've narrated upwards of 200 audiobooks) I found it impossible to invest this piece of literary flotsam with any emotional content whatsoever.  As declining the job was no longer an option, I merely tried to stay out of the way and give it as simple and logical a performance as I could, but I was unable to compensate for the God awful writing, and unable to disguise my contempt for the entire enterprise.  It remains the worst recording I have ever done, and I was, for a time, quite ashamed of it.  Now that I discover more about its hate mongering author, I'm actually quite pleased that the recording stinks.  I now believe I gave this garbage exactly the reading it deserved.  (I must add that I learned a valuable lesson: never record a book you loathe.  I was subsequently offered the execrable "Left Behind - The Kids" series for young adults, but having suffered through "Little Tree," knew better than to lend my voice to the spewing of "Christian" hate. 
 The book I am going to talk about is the book Arms and the Man By Bernard Shaw. I really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand.  The reason I didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. The English was hard to understand. I liked how the writer wrote the book and I would probably look for another one of his books. This book was more like an opera with out music. If I could have and known to I probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. One reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. If you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story. 
 when i first stepped on the scale i thought i lost 10 lbs. but after reading other review i realize the scale  is off up to 9  lbs. also this is a big scale. too big to store in the bathroo 
 I think the title of the book is misleading.  It is stories of the author's experiences and not very instructive or interesting.  It was not very well written.  Save yout time and money. 
 I like Sam Elliott movies very much. This one was BAD!!! A lot of Bad Language. Every couple of words. It should be rated R. I think instead of PG 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 This Amazon listing also suggests buying the Soundsticks along with Airport Express. If you're thinking of connecting them to the USB port of Express, Apple says it won't work. (Apple Airport Express FAQs 
 I was taken aback by how convoluted and overreaching this text was. I guess I expected more. I found myself having to read and reread certain paragraphs and sections of this book just to understand what Telford was attempting to say. I found his open hostility toward the traditional position of inerrancy troubling. One reviewer says that Work "shows how the paradigm of inerrancy is fatally flawed." He shows no such thing. He approaches the discussion and falls flat in his efforts. One way to make your point it to denigrate your opponent. This he did do. He seemed to imply that all who believe in inerrancy are lowbrow fundamentalists. Ultimately, Work's overhaul (i.e., paradigm shift) for viewing the Word of God was simply over the top and without warrant. I note that this book came out in November 2001, but I have yet to see Bible colleges and seminaries adopting Work's new paradigm and dialect, and with a sales ranking of 711,096, his book is likely not going to usher in his "new paradigm. 
 I'm puzzled as to why anyone should pay $59.39 for these three DVDs that currently retail on Amazon for $11.24 (Signs), $14.99 (Unbreakable), and $26.99 (Sixth Sense*) totaling $53.22?    *There is also a less expenseive "Collector's Version" of the Sixth Sense that only costs $14.99 if you'd rather not pay the $12.00 for the "Vista Series" extras.  I'm also skeptical as to whether the version of Unbreakable sold here has as much content as the Vista series edition sold seperately that contains 2 discs (I assume this edition does not because this box set only includes 3 discs, 1 per movie).    I love the movies, but where's the price break on buying them all together when the package is $6.17-$18.17 more than purchasing these DVD's seperately???  
 If the reader knew absolutely nothing about oil production and read this book, then he or she would believe his claim that global production of crude oil will decline permanently in the very near future.  Deffeyes takes his cue from price fluctuations, and I, knowing nothing about petroleum exploration and refining and hearing a lot about 'Peak Oil' (made popular by such conspiratorial tomes as The Grand Chessboard, The Party's Over and Crossing the Rubicon), keep hearing that little statistician's nagging voice in my head, saying:  Could there be some other explanation for the price fluctuations?  We have seen this sort of thing before, folks, and we have covered this terrain before.  Whether the subject is the population bomb or the direction of stock prices, the drama is always the same: someone, usually an academic, grabs the media spotlight with dire prognostications emanating from his high-tech crystal ball (typically some mathematical formula or computer model bearing the illusion of precision), and predicts doom on the horizon if we do not change course and adopt his (typically totalitarian) prescription for renewed prosperity.  Unlike the endless parade of kooks past who have predicted The Demise of Civilization (or life as we know it), the author's  claim to fame is three-fold: first, he has worked in the oil industry, and had the good (?) sense to abandon it for academia just before the first oil shock (consider the historical performance of the global petroleum industry over the last four decades to see just how sensible that decision was); second, he is a geologist, and tries to impress (or rather, bore) us with an endless recitation of arcane technical information on oil exploration; and third, the coup de grace- he actually worked with the infamous M. King Hubbert.  All of these things are supposed to make his pitch both credible and ring true, and I guess for those who do not like to think too deeply about things,  his position really does overflow with truth and credibility.  Since I (nor anyone else) can not check the data he used to generate the estimates sprinkled liberally throughout the book for their truthfullness, that alone sends up red flags in my mind.  These estimates form the basis for his dire conclusions, and the admittedly amateur scientist and statistician in me says that if those estimates are flawed, then so too are the conclusions flowing from them.  In reading this text, and others like it, I am constantly nagged by the following questions:  Did Hubbert predict that all oil production would decline, or did he really say something else?  Oddly enough, Mr. Hubbert is long dead, so much the (in)famous Malthus, we can not consult him to hear what he has to say about things.  Could there be another explanation for the U.S. decline in oil production?  Could that explanation, in fact, have little or nothing to do with the amount of oil in the ground?  Given that we have some idea of the situation with OPEC (and to some extent, the U.S.) with respect to production and consumption, what about the situation outside of these two regions- such as in the oceans or in the Arctic/Antartic?  If the oil supply trend globally is on the decline, why in the hell are we seeing the trend for fuel economy standards in automobiles on the decline?  Could there be some other explanation for the recent rising trend in oil prices- one having perhaps a little something to do with causes firmly rooted in a history of misguided economic and foreign policy?  The author contends that poor countries will suffer the most under the scenario of world oil shortage because poor countries need energy to run the irrigation pumps necessary to produce food to feed themselves.  Granted, fuels from petroleum are one possible energy source, but there are others.  Ever hear of natural gas?  Since most of the poor countries also have abundant renewable resources (Brazil for example has both hydro and solar resources, as well as biomass) why not use this?  I strongly suspect (but can not prove with any certainty) that pricing problems we see today may have something to do with the sort of oil that we could produce versus the kind of oil we would ideally like to use, which incidentally OPEC has a lock on.  I also suspect that maybe domestic oil production has declined not because of Hubbert's Peak but rather, much like the decline of US domestic forestry, it costs less to import the kind of crude we like than it would to produce it domestically.  In sum, this book runs on par with other erroneous Apocalyptic tomes that depend on numerical tricks, intellectual sleights of hand, strangely hidden sources and data sets, illusions of precision and rigid certainty, such as those produced by Bjorn Lomborg, Lester Brown and Stephen Moore.  Readers looking for a bit more insight into the crude oil pricing problem, albeit in a historical context, would do well to consult Robert Stobaugh's and Daniel Yergin's eerily prophetic book Energy Future 
 As much as I appreciate the intent of their book, social workers have no  place in the political process -- and, other than as citizens, they  shouldn't.  Social work is not a profession.  Social workers have sold  their souls to becomes second-rate psychotherapists.  Their advocacy days  are long over.  Schools of social work pay lip service to social justice  issues (in fact, social work organizations have not been able to define the  word "justice," much to their collective embarrassment.  Social  workers should just get back to case management and leave the other work  they attempt to lawyers, policy analysts, and well-educated psychologists.  (Of course, I'm a Columbia U. Schl. of Social Wk. grad, the most unjust  school imaginable, so I'm knowledgeable and bitter 
 The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)  The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.  I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish 
 I saw one of their music videos playing at Walmart and thought to myself: This is really cool!  Another goth/rock/alternative band along the lines of Evanescence.  I happen to be a big fan of Evanescence and I LIKE the mainstream twist of goth/rock/alternative.  Most of the times repetative music doesn't bother me.  You find this A LOT in pop, R&B and even country.  It's almost common to mistaken a Mariah Carey or Shania Twain song for a different one.  In fact, Mariah even made a remix that blended 2 of her songs.    To get back on track, I liked the female vocal.  The songs didn't allow her full potential of her talent.  The male vocals were ok.  I wasn't looking for a strictly GOTH or strictly METAL band but a mix of the two.  I happen to like it when artists experiment with music.  Otherwise Linkin Park wouldn't exist (love 'em too).  None of the songs really grabbed my attention.  Normally, there would be at least one or two I'd really listen to on a CD.  I didn't catch the name of the one that was in the music video @ Walmart so after I bought it I tried to pick it out.  I kept thinking to myself: this one must be it!  But when I get to the next one I think: wait, this one might be it!  Then they all sounded the same so I gave up.  I really tried to be open minded & and almost forced myself to pick out at least one song that would rectify purchasing a whole CD for.  But they were all pretty bland.  I don't think I've ever been so disappointed over an album purchase.  Due to the attempt at the mainstream rock/goth I gave it the extra star 
 I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please 
 I read all three Conversations with God books and enjoyed each of them. I think there is much of God in the words.   Unfortunately, as Walsch has continued writing, each of his books has more of Neale and less of God in them. Book one was very clearly inspired by spirit, book two was somewhat spirit inspired and book three is mostly Neale Donald Walsch's ego pretending to write inspired words. Tis a pity. Success can be challenging.  However Mr Walsch did inadvertently provide a massive amount of entertainment in the form of the Amazon reviews that Christians have written. They can all be summed up as "The Book Wars".   Basically. "My special book is the word of God and your book was written by the devil."  Jews, Mormons, Christians, Muslims, Scientologists, etc, etc, all have their special book. Each says that God wrote one book and one book only and that all the other books are blasphemous.  Silly but entertaining 
 I think, like many readers of the Anita Blake series, one question keeps coming to mind. Why do I continue to read her?  The reason is that there is always hope that the series will shift again.  Laurel K Hamilton has invested a great deal in Anita.  She is a necromancer, a succubus, and a panwere, with a very convoluted and confusing personal life.  She is also a Federal Marshal licensed to handle Preternatural crimes.  That is the part of these stories that captured many readers.  However, Laurel K Hamilton has not been paying any real attention to Anita's job, and has focused instead upon the ardeur- the power that makes Anita a succubus.  I tend to find this aspect of Anita the most uninteresting.  And this novel is no exception.  We have some new characters which promise some intrigue in the vampire world, but nothing ever comes of it.  Two of Jean-Claude's "friends" arrive to help celebrate an all-vampire dance troupe.  Both of them have ulterior motives for coming, and cause some problems.  But we don't focus on that.  Merlin, the leader of the Dance Troupe, makes a power-play against six Vampire Masters.  But we don't focus on that.  Instead, we have many sex scenes- some of which are just far too long and descriptive.  The plot seems to stop whenever this happens, and therefore, the story never really gets going. This was the exact same problem in the last two or three Anita Blake novels.  I love the character of Anita.  I have enjoyed watching her deal with her growing powers and her growing understanding of herself, while trying to deal with some interesting preternatural criminal.  But the last few novels have been solely focused on her growing powers and the problems they create. My problem is that there has been no resolution to these problems.  Anita has stopped growing and changing, and is becoming whiny and uninteresting.  In the preview of Harlequin, we find out that Edward is returning. We haven't seen him since Obsidian Butterfly.  Since that was also the last Anita Blake novel I could recommend to someone, I have hope that the series will shift into something worh reading.  We can still hope.  Which is why we're still buying her books 
 WARNING: The album version of "Maneater" meanders and stalls-out after less than 3 minutes (at what I would consider the song's climax), descending into over a minute and a half of nearly a cappella vocals, instrumental breakdowns, and ad-libs by Timbaland; the track concludes with several seconds of studio dialog.  "Loose" is another frustrating example of an album that does not include the same version of the song heard on the radio or in the video.  LOOSE consists of 13 songs, two of which are versions of "Te Busque".  Most of the songs are produced by Timbaland.  Booklet does not include lyrics.    The album is listen-able, and while the percussion-based "No Hay Igual" is interesting, other than the poorly edited "Maneater" and the over-played "Promiscuous", there are no stand-out tracks. 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 I fail to understand all of the hoopla about Susan Sontag. While I have only read a limited selection of her work, in these essays, "Against Interpretation" being the ultimate example, Sontag emerges as a simple-minded, arrogant ignoramus. In her utterly unreasoned invective,  Sontag ignores (or is just unable to understand) two critical facts. First,  some works of art and theory are difficult to understand (in varying  degrees) without the help of interpretation. Sontag's flawed analysis of  the supposed ruination of the works of Kafka by interpretation demonstrates  that not only is she among this crowd, she has clearly reached new and  unheard of misguided heights. Second, Sontag ignores the fact that works of  art in other languages cannot be understood in translation without the help  of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which  aspects of a certain culture are imbedded in the original language. This  couldn't possibly be clearer than in poetry. Weinberger's excellent  "Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei", which adroitly considers  the subject, hadn't been released when Sontag published this essay but it  probably wouldn't have made a difference. What was she thinking? The only  good aspect of the essay (and why I give it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero)  is the fact that it has given me ample opportunity to win arguments against  individuals who are flawed in their thinking enough to enjoy Sontag's  writing 
 We had this printer less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam. We would get an error message, and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while. We finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program, after I had to ask to speak to a supervisor. (The tech support wanted us to install a free ink cartridge when I had already installed several before contacting them) We have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again. The ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount, and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam. Tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth, and for now the unit is working. We still haven't addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem. I hope HP reviews comments on this website occasionally. I would like them to know I have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years, but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position. Also, HP tech support is very difficult to deal with at best. I talked to several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible English. I am one consumer willing to pay a little more for a product that is well supported. HP are you listening 
 Pro's  It's really roomy.... ample room for my old brick of a computer Dell 15" inspiron 6800 and my tiny HP NC6230.  Good sized for overnight.  Con's  No compression straps when you have a smaller load to carry. I ended up ripping the nylon on the bag accidently as it got hooked on the side of a gym locker.  not as good as ripstop nylon. The zipper "teeths" aren't secure/strong enough... the bag would separate at the zippers numerous times.  Eventually, the zippers all broke loose in one night, even the separate zipper for the laptop.    
 The premise of the book looked good - find the foods that give you the most bang for your buck calorie-wise. So the first couple of chapters discussed how 240 calories worth of potatoes are more filling than 240 calories of ice cream. Fine.  That said, there are three major problems I have with this book:  (a) They ought to leave it at that. Why make it into a diet? Not every book about food has to be a diet. Do they think they're Atkins? I'm already on Weight Watchers, so I don't need a diet program. A book about filling foods would be fine, thank you.  (b) They lie. It says on the cover that you can eat the foods you love and still lose weight. Then, as you read the book, it tells you to avoid this, avoid that.... So apparently, you CAN'T have your cake and eat it, too.  (c) Other than the list, the book just repeats the same old junk you've heard a zillion times - eat lots of fruits and vegetables, exercise, blah blah blah.  Luckily I took this one out of the library, as it is certainly not worth the money 
 this stuff has great shine. but it dries my lips and it starts peeling. and uber sticky 
 I haven't seen this film since it left theatres, so I suppose the visual impact of it must have been somewhat significant; I haven't forgotten one scene and recall most of it in detail.  (Tim Pope is another one of those directors who mistakes music videos for movies.)    There's a problem, though: it was really bad.  The problem, as I recall, is that we know nothing about Ashe Crowe (wow. what an original last name for this movie.): he's just some unbelievably nice father who (lives?) in a garage shop with his son, Danny.  Till guess what?  A bunch of drug-using, scummy semi-gangsters come and ruin his, uh, idyllic life by murdering his son and then him.  Vincent Perez is nowhere near Brandon Lee's level of talent as an actor, and Lee himself was no Olivier.  But Iggy Pop!  He's perfect as the badass scumbag ("nothing personal, sport...") who puts the final shot in Perez's character on the docks.  He's so good that it's almost like he's not acting.  The best scene in this movie is when Crowe, after blasting Pop's character to nearly nothing, places two coins in his eyes and sends him floating on the scummy city river: heavy handed symbolism, yes, very striking, yes as well.  Otherwise, it sucked and strikes no comparison to the Gothic, almost believable majesty of the original.  I remember reading James O'Barr saying that he wanted nothing to do with the film before it came out and did not want his name in the credits.  Good move on his part.  Watch the original and read the comic book.     
 this dvd sucks. im a die hard strokes fan and expected the dvd to open up with some strokes music or and interview or two.there is absolutely no strokes music and they have a few like stock photos of them doin their thing live but other than that this dvd is a complete letdown.do not waste ur money go buy their two albums instead 
 Don't let the cover fool you, this film isn't half as fun as you may hope it is. Maybe it's my own fault, but I was expecting something more like "Groove", or at least something interesting to watch. And it's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands, I often listen to Joy Division/New Order/Happy Mondays, and more from that scene. However, this seemed much more like the story of Tony Wilson and The Factory, than it did about the music, and almost came-off as a documentary. I almost stopped watching it out of boredom, but saw it through anyway. Now I wouldn't call this bad, it had it's good parts, just not many. 
 COME was released during a rough time in Prince's career, possibly the height of his quarrels with Warner Bros. (his long-time label). Listening to this, you get the feeling that Prince may have released it as a 'f*** you' to the WB. He really was writing and recording great material at the time, and performing great concerts, but you wouldn't know it from listening to COME.  Regardless, there's one epochal cut here, "Loose!" A thunderous stomp that's one part hard-funk, one part industrial, I've heard some compare it to a Nine Inch Nails production, but it's totally Prince. As much as I hate this album, I always come back to "Loose!" You can probably purchase it through online vendors like iTunes for roughly a dollar, otherwise, get one of the cheap, used copies here (as of this writing there are a few well under $2 before shipping).  Hopefully WB or Prince will make "Loose!" available on a compilation, rendering COME obsolete, but until that happens, the disc is worth listening for that one track alone 
 what a sad ending to robert pollards ever revolving band, this again is only for the diehards who want every single piece of merchandise that gbv has to offer, i jumped on the bandwagon with the release of ''propeller''way back when, but jumped off after the horrid ''isolation drills'' this dvd contains many good songs but they are just horribly played and bob's singing was disgusting, not a proper way to go out if you ask me but again, the material they were releasing near their end was bland and uninspirin 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 Not worth the money spent on it.  After reviewing info on my new digital camera I followed suggestions to get the rechargeable batteries kit to save money on AA batteries.  I did not need the camera case that came with this kit, and it really had too many pockets for my liking.  The batteries did not hold a charge.  I only got a few pictures taken before they went dead.  If the spare set sat in the camera for a few days they too were dead.  At least I got a full set of pictures taken on the duracell ones.  I would much rather buy batteries and have them on hand then always be running back to the charger after a few shots.  I have had no experience with rechargables before so I do not know if this is common.  But I returned this item as a defect because for this amount of money you should get more then six pictures per charge 
 A mediocre intro into such a fascinating subject. Instead of explaining concepts and helping develop abilities to solve problems, Griffiths plays silly algebra games throughout this text. Some truly elementary material he made rather complicated, explaining the obvious but omitting points crucial for understanding. With this book, forget about any intuitive knowledge of QM. If you like the monkey business of endless calculations, this one will not get you bored. But if you simply want to learn this fabulous branch of modern physics, consider Shankar, "Principles of QM", much more self-contained and well written. A little note for students to whom this reading is mandatory: Save your own nerves, and get the Solution Manual - will help you a lot on the exams. 
 Not the best compulation I would have come up with. Only had one or two songs on it that I liked. But oh well Its in my collection now. Maybe it will grow on me later 
 As an eighties child myself, Killing Moon, Bedbugs and Ballyhoo along with a few others have a very special place in my heart. So I thought I'd venture out a little and see if there was anything else I overlooked from their era.   NOPE. I had not, and this was a waste of money.  
 Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.   I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!  It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.   Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty 
 My 4-year-old son LOVED The Berenstain Bears' New Baby and it was a big help in preparing for the arrival of his baby sister.  So when we were struggling with remembering manners, I bought this book, certain that it would help.  However, I ended up disagreeing with the approach to correcting bad or forgotten manners and rude behavior.  This book outlined specific chores as punishments for various offenses. As parents, we have learned that allowing children to help around the house with things like sweeping, taking out the garbage, and helping Mommy empty the dishwasher (the plastic stuff!) is very empowering and makes kids feel like they can contribute to the household and they enjoy being part of the "family team" (hopefully this will continue into their teens since we've started them as toddlers!).   Also, I learned that I should probably read through any new book by myself at least once before sitting down to read it to my children (parents can learn too!).  Just a thought 
 ... the subject matter is very intriging and deservesattention. However, Ms. Chang's book has no real insight into Tsien'slife.... The actual writting is also lackingg. The book is filled with dragging sentences that fails to excite the reader. I only recommand this book to readers who do not know anything about Chinese history or Tisen. It is to be used as an general and elementry reference only. Even then, there are still many holes... 
 I really thought I was going to like this book as I am easy to please when it comes to chic lit novels.  This was pretty bad and it had like 4 or 5 sex scenes that literally went on for a whole chapter for each of them.  Its like the author couldn't think of a plot or good dialogue and just decided to fill the pages with rauchy sex scenes.  I like romance and all but this was overkill - I found myself skipping pages by the third one.  It was weak, totally unrealistic and predictable 
 I was not impressed by this book. No new insights or solutions - same old information 
 I found this uninteresting, and it dragged out so much. Too much detail, that I could care less about 
 We may never know if we like this product as the Amazon box was empty when it arrived.  We have had no help from amazon, compusa, nor the maker of this software after numerous emails and phone calls.  This was my son's Christmas present and he's still waiting... at this rate we'll end up with the opinion that we shouldn't order software online... 
 I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other  of Anne Tyler's books.  This book deals with the life of a depressed  teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not  recommend reading it.  On the up side, it's really short so you can get  through it rather quickly.  I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt  worse after finishing this one 
 This attack on soap opera attempts to tell the readers that soap opera,  like other forms of popular entertainment, glorifies the role of the father  and brainwashes its viewers to be submissive to patriarchal imperitives   However, the theory in this book simply panders to the most narrow-minded  of extremist feminists.  The theory does not fit the facts.  Soap opera is  one of the major popular entertainments that permits critical questions  about the excesses of the father's prerogatives to surface.  By discussing  small fragments of soap opera story arcs as if they were the whole thing,  this book distorts its subject and renders a major disservice to its  reader 
 I just finished reading this book, and the one that follows it: The Cat who Dropped a Bombshell.  Both of them are disappointing and not worth reading. And I now realize what the problem is. Dear Lilian is not writing these books anymore. She's either deceased or retired. Someone else is writing them. A person who doesn't have a clue as to how to spin a good mystery story. All through this book I kept waiting for the mystery to be presented, worked on, spun out and then solved. But it never happened. The book was boring with all its details and run-on commentary about things going on in the town. The step-son is presented and disappears, murders are hinted at but never resolved, the "guilty party" is discovered at the end, but dismissed with a shrug. Mysterious circumstances are presented and then dropped. What's the point? If the publishers want to continue this series, then they have to find a new writer who has some mystery writing experience, who can follow in Ms. Braun's footsteps, and continue the series with style 
   This is not a bad book, but about half is on basic building skills which anyone who is going to build a sizable strucuture ought to have acquired first. You can get that from a Time Life or Readers Digest 'Home improvement' book on basic carpentry skills. Very general instructions without a lot of detail- for example, window fininshing details, roof details- you have to figure out the details yourself, and everyone knows that is where the devil is! And when the chapter on electrical wiring starts out by reccomending that you shouldn't do it yourself, well... it's just a sign of too many lawyers in the USA.     The sections on barns and other strucuture are interesting, with lots of ideas that one can adapt to your specific needs. Most are reworked from USDA Cooperative extension plans- which you can view a huge number for free from Univ of North Dakota at this link- http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/abeng/plans/index.htm Since I found this website, my opinion of the book has gone down a lot, since so much is not original material.      The other challenge I would have is on pole frame constuction- all his plans show huge concerte footings 16-24" dia 8-12" thick under poles for his buildings. Digging/drilling and pouring these negates the advanage in work/cost saving of pole frame building. In the area where I live, poles are commonly set in our heavy clay with a little cement or just well tamped soil around them. I understand the concern about bearing ability, and I'm not an engineer, but these poles function as pilings- they hold up the load not just from their bottom surface area, but also from the friction of the post in the ground. Any professional can correct me if they feel otherwise.  All in all, it is an interesting book but he could omit the first half and flesh out the rest.  
 Yeah, those folks in the 50's sure were paranoid and gullible. Ha ha. How anyone could possibly think that the subject of nuclear holocaust and the fear thereof could be milked for a few laughs is pathetic. But even if this film was entirely based on a fictional threat the vast majority of its fitful stabs at humor require a deeper state of inebriation than I would care to endure 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 As an initiated priest of Palo, I can say that it depends on what house you are in whether you think this book, or any other book by Lydia Cabrera, is all that good or not. This one does have some interesting material, as do all her books. But it has plenty that is not universally agreed upon, and it has absolutely nothing at all to say about the deeper, and most important secrets of Palo. Palo is not a standardized tradition. What you know and what you do depends on what house you are coming from. The houses are secret societies. You can't expect to learn anything without being in a house. It's as simple as that. No good Palero is going to make the secrets public. By their very nature, that would be insane. Not that I am showing disrespect to Lydia Cabrera. Her books are more or less good. I like some parts of her "La Regla Kimbisa." But a word of caution to you who want to dabble with African magic: there is a lot that will never be put into writing. Dabbling, when you don't know what you are dealing with, and especially in Palo, is a very fool hardy and dangerous thing to do. You don't know what you don't know. A lot of the older Paleros question what got into Lydia Cabrera to write what she did. Palo is closed to the uninitiated 
 ... Video and audio quality are on par with VHS -- even the bonus trailer of "The Night Visitor" looks like a third-generation bootleg copy. Had I bought this at a gas station, I would have expected this kind of quality, but a serious DVD release tagetted at Bava fans should have more effort put into it. A total waste of the DVD format. Can't wait for someone else to release it so I can sell it. If you love Bava's work, you won't be disappointed by the movie, but I recommend you buy it used .. 
 This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  I really enjoyed "Single's Ward" and thought I'd give this a try.  The characters were overplayed and the movie seemed drag on and on.  I would have been disappointed had I spent $4.00 renting this movie--unfortunately I bought it.  If you really want to buy the movie, email me and I'll give you a great deal on mine.  My copy has only been used once 
 ...when a band that is known for their humor tries to take themselves seriously.  The album that comes before this one, "Take Off Your Pants And Jacket," was a great mix of pop and comedy.  The title alone is a joke.  And the fact that they probably knew that tons of 12-year old kids would be buying that album and hearing songs about f***ing dogs and grandfathers s***ing after eating too many hot dogs, is hilarious to me.  But, alas, this album has nothing to offer.  Blink 182 hopped off the silly bus and took a turn for the worse.  There is not one funny section on this album.  (Perhaps the only funny thing is how commercially successful the song "Feeling This" got).  Anyone else notice that the band decided to break up right after the release of this album, putting out one last album (of greatest hits) simply to fulfill their record contract?  This is most likely because they either realized how far they had fallen or they all became too pretentious for their own good.  Either way, this album sucked... hard.  I wouldn't wish this upon anyone (over the age of 12).  And why this was self-titled is beyond me, as it is completely different than anything they've ever put out.  Blink was better when they sang about adult diapers.  Not reading some stupid letter from a war as some kind of a serious interlude 
 Im a huge Stone Cold fan and I have got to say that I am horribly dissapointed. This disc does not contain any of the good Stone Cold matches...specificlly the matches during the Austin/Mcmahon/Corporate Ministry era.   Luckally, I rented this from Blockbuster. The main story is good but the rest I have seen in other DVDs. I was hoping for alot of matches. It would take atleast 4-6 DVD discs full of matches to really go deep into Austin's history. But 1 disc is pathetic. I put shame on the WWE as they have no idea what fans want.   This DVD was not even worth the rent. I am a horribly horribly dissapointed Stone Cold fan and wonder how the WWE could put out trash such as this.   I hope the WWE releases a 3-6 DVD set on Stone Cold otherwise I hope the WWE goes out of business as they are a horrible wrestling company now a days ever since they lost competion (WCW and ECW) and have no motivation to become better 
 I was on a plane from Shanghai to Bangkok -- stop drooling -- and I was reading a book. On the TV, I saw Tim Allen chasing an orange cat. In the course of the chase, he dropped down from two legs to four. The effects, I'll admit right up front, were great. This looked far better than the old 70s (I think) version called THE SHAGGY D.A., which I haven't seen. But even so, it sucks. I didn't need sound or subtitles, and I didn't need but 5 or 10 minutes to figure out that it sucks. True sucking is like that. (Yeah, I saw the bit with the Scrabble board. "I am Dad." Whoop dee freaking doggy doo.) It's possible we underestimate Tim Allen's ability as an actor, perhaps because THE SANTA CLAUSE was so unforgivably bad. But even so, this movie sucks. Sometimes life is just that simple.  
 I don't so much mind the money I wasted on this book, it's the time that bothers me. Bill Rancic, you're fired 
 An attempt to add glamour to the job of writing code, by someone who clearly read the more popular works of Roger Zelazny at an impressionable age. The good points are nice, nippy action, an interesting blend of computers and magic, and a brave attempt to create a universe with an actual underlying metaphysic. Bad points are the non-existent characterisation (a simple tendency to crack wise is insufficient), the heavy-handed exposition (we know that Eris has a sense of humour, it is adequately shown, it does not need to be explained again in narrative), clunky dialogue, and the heavy miasma of wish-fulfillment that hangs over the book. Unless you are trapped in an airport with nothing else to do,  read "Nine Princes In Amber" instead 
 Jo-Ellan Dimitrius has written a HORRIBLE book. Do not buy this goofy junk.  Only buy it if you like killers walking around free and  killing your children. 
 	In Heresy, Magic, and Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe, Gary K. Waite attempts to tie together the various persecutions that took place in Early Modern Europe.  Whether persecution was aimed against Christian heretics, witches, or Jews, its purpose was always the same: reinforcing current orthodoxy against growing doubt.  Thus, Waite claims that the more pluralistic the society, the less fringe groups were persecuted. 	This book is flawed.  Waite argues his thesis tendentiously, citing portions of scholarship on Early Modern Europe that support his claims and ignoring scholarship that would question them.  The book is a brief synthesis of other scholars' works, and Waite's contribution consists of mere assertions that lack supporting evidence.  Waite does not engage the sources of Early Modern Europe; instead he trusts others to do the work of research for him.  When he quotes a primary source, his citation is always from some secondary literature.  This form of "researching" may be fine for a survey of the historiography, but Waite is attempting to argue a thesis. 	Not only is his methodology wanting, but also his thesis is much too simplistic.  Waite argues as societies become more pluralistic, persecution of the "Other" lessens.  He cites example after example of how the reigning orthodoxy persecuted the "Other" in order to strengthen its position in society.  Places like the Netherlands and Maria Theresa's Austria, however, did not persecute irrationally because of tolerance for a multiplicity of ideas.  This formulation is inadequate.  Waite fails to grapple with the religious situation in Spain in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  Spain was the most ethnically and religiously diverse region in Europe, and its variegated population managed a high level of cooperation for centuries.  Instead of peaceful toleration, however, this region led to some of the most intense persecution of the "Other." 	Waite's explanation of the Jewish situation in Early Modern Europe also has many problems.  He asserts, "Jews ... were officially tolerated in the Christian west because they proved an extremely useful, if unwitting, ally in the campaign to expel religious doubt from the hearts of Christian believers" (19).  As a causal claim, this statement is ludicrous.  Waite implies a conspiracy by the Church to use Jews to quench Christian doubt.  The evidence does not support this assertion.  (His reasons for the persecution of women during the witch-hunts similarly lack evidentiary substantiation.) 	Not only are Waite's methods and assertions suspect, but he lacks a fundamental understanding of the subject that he is trying to address.  In the book's introduction, Waite writes, "Religion is always nonrational, for its tenets cannot be proven by empirical testing" (3).  This statement belies a misunderstanding of rationalism, religion, or both.  As a system of knowledge, rationalism is not dependent on evidence or empirical testing.  Rationalism relies on human reason.  Just as religion cannot be empirically tested, neither can mathematics.  Rationalism and empiricism are competing systems of knowledge.  Waite's conflation of the two demonstrates a positivist bent, and positivism is self-referentially absurd.  Thus, Waite founds his philosophical approach to this subject upon a defective meta-narrative, and readers should be skeptical of his claims 
 While I have learned to steer clear of Oprah Book Club selections over the years (which always seem to be shallow downers), the Today Show Book Club sticker on this one seemed at least a little more encouraging. As a high school English teacher, I am always looking for books that might appeal to teenagers. Like many other books before it, critics have claimed this one has a Holden-esque feel to it. And as with other books that have made this claim, it falls short...way short. This book is listed on amazon as a "grade 9 and up" book, so my expectations were not quite what they would be for an "adult" piece of literature. Even with my lowered expectations, I was disappointed. The author is young, only 23, and his writing is very undeveloped. In fact, I felt like I was reading one of my 10th grader's stories here. So, I suppose on one level, he succeeded: he did create a youthful narrator. But, this compliment is not entirely complimentary. The writing "sounds" young, but not altogether real. The frequent cussing is pretty accurate, as is the struggle to be cool. But, the dialogue is still fairly out of touch with real teens. The partying and drug use were over-the-top, and the story about the pill-computer was pretty lame too. It kind of came together in the end, but not really. I expect to see this brought to the big screen someday and star some cheesy young actors like from Malcolm in the Middle or something. This future movie would likely get an R rating for the inappropriate elements, or get watered down for a PG-13 rating, but the effect would still probably only be popular with immature 14 year-olds. I didn't see anything worthwhile for older teens, or adults, and am frankly surprised this was part of an adult book club. It made a little more sense when I learned that Judy Blume is the one who selected this author. I wish I had known that prior to picking this one up; I may have opted to skip it altogether. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not good. There are other coming-of-age books out there where the writing is better developed, the characters are more endearing, and the plot is more feasible. Keep looking 
 this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha ga 
 Amazon indicated this item was in stock when I ordered it more than a week ago.  I got an Email today telling me it hasn't shipped yet, but is "in process" and I will get it 23 Feb (2 more weeks).  They also say I can't change my order now since it's "in process".  I figured it's because they probably don't really have it in stock, so I went to the order page and they say there that it's in stock and would ship in 2 to 3 days (same as when I ordered).  I'll never place another order with Amazon.  They can keep the book and my money.  They don't offer a link, phone number, or anything to contact their customer service, so I used this forum. I don't like being treated this way 
 ....I have ever read. Not the worst either. But I didn't enjoy it. I see that alot of the other reviewers thought it was great, but, I guess it was just not to my taste. Bummer is I bought it new. (lol)I am not going to go on with the series...why throw good money after bad 
 Sir Cyril Burt achieved unparalleled results in researching the effects of environment and heredity on identical twins.  Only after his death did it become clear that the alleged research had never happened, that Burt lied to further what he perceived to be a greater truth. Sadly, the possibility must be considered that Milton Erickson did likewise.  Not only do the results he claimed to have achieved involve impossible to believe coincidences and phenomena far beyond anything ever achieved by anyone else.  They also include results that even unshakable believers in hypnotism's real existence concede are unreplicable and should be impossible.  If Erickson really accomplished what he claimed in various medical journals, then he was a miracleworker beyond compare.  Somehow I doubt that. 
 This was another Pinker book I couldn't finish. If he was a taxi-driver he would take you from Brooklyn to New York via San Francisco. Sometimes even his asides have asides! Perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word 
 This is the worst book of Shakespeare criticism I have ever read.  Bloom makes no attempt to link one paragraph to the next.  It reads like 30 years of lecture notes piled together haphazardly, handed to a graduate student, and entered into a computer over a weekend.  He contradicts himself several times.  I donated my copy to the library as soon as I was done reading it, so I cannot cite the pages where the contradictions occur; but several times I recall reading a passage where Bloom had just said the exact opposite a few pages earlier.  To make matters worse, he even says the bard contradicts HIMself.  He points to supposed paradoxes regarding Hamlet's age, stating that his seeming age does not jive with textual evidence that would put his age at about 30.  Apparently the point is that if Shakespeare contradicts himself, so can Bloom.  Bloom ignores the obvious conclusion that Hamlet is a slacker.  He has not grown up yet.  That is why his parents tell him to come home from school and not to waste his time as a professional student when he should be learning how to run a kingdom.  Some of the book's observations are interesting, but they are glossed over and presented as a random jumble from Bloom's notes.  Interespersed between the passages scribbled down from Bloom's lectures are outbursts where Bloom reminds us that Shakespeare is without any question whatsover the greatest writer, in verse or prose, who ever lived.  Bloom is a great critic when he still tries, but in this book he was not even trying 
 I came across this book when advising a friend's college-age child who was researching careers and was using this book.  On the plus side, the book does contain info on basic job search skills.  I would say that most (if not all of it) is now widely available via the internet.  Very troubling was the inaccurate guidance regarding specific careers - some of it was just outdated, but some of it was inaccurate to the point of being "dangerous" for a reader with little knowledge or experience, and who would choose to spend time/effort pursuing a career based on the info in this book.  I would have to recommend against using this book as a key source for making a career choice 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 We were excited to order this book after reading the other reviews.  We have two adopted children - the oldest is now 4 and the youngest is 1 1/2.  We were VERY disappointed.  In its 33 pages, the book provided some nice art and a couple of nice sentiments in its 150 words - but nothing more.  While less may be more, there wasn't much value in this book for us.  We would recommend finding another book that would be more useful.  We're certainly still looking.. 
 Sorry, folks, I found The Sunday Wife to be shallow, predictable and just plain boring! None of the characters were appealing and, as I said, I thought it a boring plot 
 The dust jacket of this book boasts that it is "the first comprehensive photographic record of the bombings". However, its idea of comprehensiveness - while finding room for a film poster of the 1952 Robert Taylor movie "Above and Beyond" - does not include *a single one* of the tens of thousands of corpses littering the ground of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   That's right. As far as the 500+ photographs in this "objective, informative volume" [quoting the dust jacket again] are concerned, our two atomic bombs - while producing a lot of rubble and five mild burn victims - did not cause a single fatality.   The chief author of this book is identified as "a retired U.S. Air Force officer". Make of this what you like 
 I waited to read this book and was totally disgusted with it. It was more of a history about her mother (who was no doubt certifiable). Ms Wood dedicated her life, for good or for bad, to the Screen. The least this author could have done was not to  write it like someone was standing over his shoulder! 
 I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement 
 I think it stayed fogless for two uses.  After that, it fogged up like any ordinary mirror - even with using the "special glass cleaner" it came with.  Too bad.  Total dissappointment.  
 From the author's website and the titles of the three books I purchased, I was expecting something both steamier and more insightful.  OK- I admit it- a lot steamier.  Instead, the reader learns that although almost all of the men interviewed seem to be former sex partners of Mr. Zeeland, there is amazingly little sexual charge in the book.  Furthermore, Mr. Zeeland gives the reader little insight into the inner workings of these gay military men.  Rather, the book is an insight into him- a self-confessed "military-chaser-".  Finally, the book is a dry, slow read- the book is an interview format, which I found tedious.  This is a book that might be worth borrowing, but isn't worth purchasing ne 
 He bowed at a shinto shrine. He attends the Pagan rite at Bohemian Grove for the Cremation of Care. He belongs to the Order of Death also known as Skull and Bones. His wife says he milks male horses and that she enjoys male dancers.  Only the blind could think this is a description of a Bible believer 
 In "The Monkey Wrench Gang," Edward Abbey told the story of four friends who decide to do whatever possible to stop the explotation and overdevelopment of the West.  Mainly, they blow stuff up and wreck machines, but they have a fun time doing it.   In "Hayduke Lives!," the sequel to that book, Edward Abbey returns to those characters and tries to stir them up to action once again, this time with the threat of a giant bulldozer about to destroy a beautiful canyon.   Yeah....   First of all, do not read this until you've read "The Monkey Wrench Gang" first.  And even then, think about it carefully before reading this half-formed, rambling, disappointing sequel.   I loved "The Monkey Wrench Gang"--I've read it multiple times--and so the first fifty pages or so of this were just a lot fun to me, being reunited with the characters from that book.   But then, the story never really goes anywhere.  The novel constantly digresses to describe sex scenes or Earth First! rallies, and it's not until page 270(!) of a 307-page novel that the four original members of the Monkey Wrench Gang finally reunite.   The book rambles on in an unfocused way that damages the characters that were so nicely formed in the first book, constantly digresses, and ultimately, unfortunately, becomes much more violent than "The Monkey Wrench Gang" ever did.   The writing is occassionally good--sometimes even great--and some of the scenes are exciting, but none of it ever goes anywhere.  There are too many characters and not enough character development, and the whole thing with the bulldozer comes across as lame and cheesy, especially when the first book set up their next goal to be something much bigger and more exciting--the destruction of Glen Canyon Dam.   Read this only if you absolutely LOVED "The Monkey Wrench Gang," but even then, be warned that this might dampen your enthusiasm even for that book.  It's pretty disappointing, especially coming from an author that we all know was capable of much, much better.          
 I had brain surgery and my short-term memory is gone. For Ms. Backer to remember all the things that she says she does is impossible. Anybody who reads this book and thinks they'll have a memory like her's after the operation, I can tell you now, that it will not happen.  One thing you will hear often from family and friends when having conversations about events that happened after the surgery is, "don't you remember". To recall conversations word for word, it's not going to happen. She remembers to much 
 I am one of the few Barry Bonds fans around, so when I decided to find a book on him, I was disappointed to find that there were surprisingly few.  Noticing that "Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman" was purported to be in-depth, not just another glossy biography and had good reviews on Amazon.com, I decided to make the purchase.  Now, after reading it and piecing a few things together, I must say that I am thoroughly let-down.  A few observations:  1) The cover and title are cheesy.  I know that the book's author may not have had any say in this, but using "Baseball's Superman" as a title makes it sound like a cover story for Sports Illustrated for Kids.  2) The book is not written well.  It is very choppy and author Steven Travers has a tendency to ramble off-topic for pages on end.  3) Not that I'm some avatar of morality, but what's the deal with all the sexual references?  [...]  4) There are contradictions sprinkled throughout the book.  For instance, on page 36, Travers quotes Bonds as saying: "My father and I were never really close when I was growing up."  Then, just five pages later, he quotes Bonds as saying: "My father and I have always been very close."  Sure, Bonds is the one contradicting himself, but Travers never points this out, just one example of the multiple occasions where I almost laughed out loud at the book's inconsistencies.  5) How many times are we to hear that Travers played pro ball?  Big deal, you struck out 15 guys in a minor league game. There are minor-leaguers who have hit 60 homers, thrown perfect games, etc. and they are nobodies.  I do not mean this as a slight, just a point that we do not need to hear incessantly about things such as "Stan Javier played with me" or how you sat in Randy Johnson's recliner, or how an interview subject calls you "Trav."  The book is about Barry Bonds, not Steven Travers.  [...]  The bottom line is that Travers squandered a golden opportunity.  Rolling the dice early in 2001 that Bonds would break the home run record, getting permission to do a book, and then seeing him acutally do it is akin to hitting the lottery for a sports journalist.  Unfortunately, the finished product seems hastily thrown together, poorly edited, and foolishly out-of-bounds in many areas.  Too often we hear about sexual hijinks that have nothing to do with Bonds, and we also get Travers's opinions on a multitude of subjects that I don't care to know his thoughts on.  The fact that I'd never even heard of this book should have been enough of a red flag, but it wasn't, and therefore I got what I deserved.  This book isn't terrible, but it also is not good, and therefore I would not recommend it.  Fans of Barry Bonds should just wait until a comprehensive biography comes out on him when his playing days are over 
 Not a huge fan of James Cagney or gangster movies, and nothing about White Heat has changed that opinion.  Lame plot, corny dialogue, and just plain bad acting constantly had me cringing.  In it's day this movie was no different than the generic blow-em'-up action/adventure movies that Hollywood has churned out en masse in more recent decades.  Hardly what I would consider to be a classic 
 I have read numerous books on Forex trading and this ranks amongst the worst. This is a sham and is designed in duping wannabees into partubg with their hard earned cash. The tools mentioned in this book are available free on many websites and the strategies are too simplistic (in a bad way) Good luck with implementing them but by the time you do, the event will have been and gone 
 No one person has done greater damage to the English language and its literature than Ezra Pound. After being mistakenly hailed by T.S.Eliot (a great poet) the works of Pound have been taken as a licence for thousands of mediocrities to gush their meaningless tosh all over the rest of us, get worshipped for their esoteric genius, when in fact they are just lazy, sloppy, selfish, regurgitators of rubbish. Language was invented so that people could communicate with each other, and make sense of what the other person was saying. Pound kicked into the 20th century full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, since he had nothing to say, and was in fact a kind of mental and spiritual dyslexic. Still, that certainly qualifies him to represent the 20th century Zeitgeist.   
 Similarities: The cover looks exactly the same, the main character goes by "Lang" (Lang Reilly - Robert Langdon!!), it takes place all over Europe, the storyline also has to do with the Knights Templar, people die, etc. (Seems as if the author doesn't have very many original ideas...)  Differences: The main charachter is not likeable, many many spelling mistakes (??), the last page is uneccesary (in my opinion), and it seemed like important parts didn't get the attention to detail that they deserved.  I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because it held my interest enough for me to finish it, but it's not something I would read again 
 I plodded at a tortoiselike pace through this tedious, monotonous work of fiction that sluggishly shares the assumed thoughts of a snobbish tortoise. Yes, yes. I get it. Klinkenborg deliberately paced his novel to evoke the slow-creeping crawl of Timothy, but, like this book, a dozing tortoise seldom holds my interest 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 I am not excited about this purchase because it is just "another hints book" like all the other authors.  I wish someone could come up with a better book pertaining to this subject! 
 I can't believe anyone would give this stroller a good review. We have 10m twins, and have been using the stroller for about 4-5 months. It's terrible.  PROBLEMS:   1. NO SUN PROTECTION. the visors are locked in place. Unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back, it will be beating in your babies' eyes, and you'll need to buy a non-Peg Perego sunshade accessory. 2. HARD TO STEER. It gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt. If the sidewalk buckles just an inch (common from tree roots), the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks. It's hard to steer in a straight line, so it's easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks.  3. IT'S FLIMSY. The bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use. It now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it. The cupholder broke during the first week. 4. HARD TO UNFOLD. It takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position. Don't even THINK about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands: you need both hands free to deal with this thing. 5. BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT. The stroller comes with no weight/height/age  suggestions. When we first tried to put our twins in it, they were swimming in it, and couldn't be upright. When we called Peg Perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely, the support rep said " don't know."   Yes it's lightweight and folds up nicely. But the light weight is actually a drawback; it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly -- resulting in a stroller that's difficult to steer.   My advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers. Even if you aren't an active parent -- I'm not -- get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand, dirt, and grass that you will encounter.  If stroller size is the most important factor to you, look at "stadium seating" strollers. 
 "The Glorious Cause" is the sequel to "Rise to Rebellion," and since the first novel was so good I eagerly dove into this one, but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 4, as compared to the 8 I would give "Rise to Rebellion."  The events recounted in "Rise to Rebellion" involving the lead up to the Revolutionary War seemed so much more detailed and interesting, with a vast array of characters that were so colorful; John Adams, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and others. "The Glorious Cause" was not without its merits, but it seemed so much drier and less appealing, with a more narrow focus. It was far too long in some parts, to the point my attention wandered, and getting through it was a chore in some sections, unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages. I listened to this book on audio tape during my commute, and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene.  One element I felt truly slighted by was the coverage of Benedict Arnold and his defection to the British cause. I assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book, but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material.  A mark of a good book is how I feel when I have finished reading it - if I am disappointed I have reached the end of the story, then I know it was time well spent. Getting to the end of "The Glorious Cause" felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project; it was uncomfortable work, and now that I'm done I feel I can do something a bit more interesting. Because Shaara did such a good job with "Rise to Rebellion" I don't feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility; perhaps the subject matter didn't complement my taste as well. I prefer interesting historial detail over tepid, droning battle descriptions, and I feel the differences between those two categories represent perfectly the differences between "Rise to Rebellion" and "The Glorious Cause. 
 "The End of Science" is a stupid book written by a stupid science fanboy journalist with a big case of envy for Francis Fukuyama's "The End of History and the Last Man." "The End of Science" is what happens when journalists spend so much time hanging out and fawning over scentists that they start believing they're scientists themselves 
 Hard to believe this book is worse than "One Arrow, One Life..."...Kushner actually did a better job at explaining Kyudo & Zen, but fell short in other areas-(see my review of that book if you wish). In "Zen in the Art of Archery"  Herrigel is searching to understand Kyudo, he doesn't get it for a very long time. Example, I loved this line from the book..."I pointed out to the Master that I was already in my fourth year and that my stay in Japan was limited". Now that's funny. So he stayed on another 2 years. The "Master" is constantly running circles around him, e.g.,...Herrigel..."And who or what is this "It"?....The Master..." Once you have understood that you will have no further need of me..." This is painful mind drivel to read. Save your money. 
 I had a hard time finishing this book. I kept thinking the book would get more interesting but nothing kept my attention. Part two on automobiles was probably the most interesting part but I still nearly put the book away to read others. I was not impressed with the author's style of writing. He seems to have a fascination with one or two words sentences which became very annoying. I would not recommend this book.

  Whatever else the GLTB community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk, the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy, and that is a boldfaced lie.  Featuring world famous funny man Dom DeLuise, the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two on-stage lesbians...and "sparks fly."  As it is, the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe.  From the movie's self-proclaimed description, and with DeLuise in a major role, the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless:  Does DeLuise KNOW that the actresses are lesbians?  Do the production's other members? Does that derail the production?  What mayhem ensues?   In point of fact, however, the single attempt at "comedy" comes from DeLuise's portrayal of the director as a prissy, fastidious old queen, pampered and catered to by his boy-toy assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats.    The bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue, as the "actresses" explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of on-stage lovers.  Unfortunately, there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore.  The few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their on-stage roles under DeLuise's fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic.  There is an inescapable feeling that the camera, the viewer, AND DeLuise, are intruders.  About the only thing that CAN be said about this film is that Director Lee Friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual Hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles, thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort; the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street.  Other reviewers have commented on the bad, infomercial level acting of the two lead characters.  Whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads, Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon, are actually lesbians simply playing themselves.  If so, then this IS bad acting.  If the women are straight, however, one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances.  Sadly, there is not much other credit to be given to anything else about this film.  
 Even with the questionable veracity, I enjoyed Frey's first book, A Million Little Pieces, since it stayed true to an addict's experience.  Leonard, on the other hand, came off as pure fantasy, with very little substance.  Even the description of Frey's struggle was too contrived to be believable.  It was not even interesting as fiction.

 I don't know anyone would like to read this book unless they are Afrian Americans. In "How Capatalism Underdeveloped Black America," the author writes the only way to achieve economic, political and social development for Blacks is to overthrow Captalist system in United States. As the author said, since the country is dominated by racist, and sexist white Americans, a bloody revolution has to be acted. The first phase of the socialist revolution is voting for progressive and anticapitalist politicians. The second phase is creating a chaotic living condition in America so that government has to cooperate with revoluntists. After the success of the socialist reforms, and totally eliminated captalism in the nation. They are going to support other countries to achieve "equality", too. Our country is going to be working class based nation, with universal health care, volunteer military officers, and equal-paid wage. 
 I was born and raised in India on the wrong side of the caste system. I worked hard to become educated and to come to America. Perhaps in the 1960s, America was not as fair as it is now, but it was still better than anywhere else. I find books like this, where people whine about the amount of melanin in their skin, offensive. Angelou comments often about how much she hates white people. This is stupid and it shows how uneducated she still is.   If she had written this in the 1960s, in the throes of it, it might be interesting as a historical piece, but now it just shows how racist she it. I'll bet she hates Asians, too. Even when she was abandoned in Egypt by a man she wrongly called her "husband," (even though they weren't married,) she wouldn't go to the American embassy for help because white people worked there. Every slight in her life, she attributes to white people being racist because she is black.   This book is filled with name-dropping and smug anger.   Minn

 Professor Shaw is certainly not starved for thoroughness in presenting the rise and fall of the Ottoman state. But what this text boils down to is something that Herman Melville would have penned had he been a scholar in Turkish history. Piling on fact after fact after fact is not conducive to a worthwhile learning experience. You would need more than two hands to count how many times I flung this text against the wall, and I consider myself to be *very* patient. Luckily, there are alternatives available.

 Two huge problems with this book. One, this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and "traveling and learning" when they already know his identity, so I guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass. Two, the city of Los Angeles functions as a character in Kellerman's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels. This thing drags on in some unnamed, nondescript city 
 Of course Stossel can talk big about busting them "liberals" but his book makes no sense about it because he admits that he never intended to bust them but instead join them. Ever wonder why ABC hires such kooks while rejecting talented youths? Ever wonder why Stossel says that the best way to punish them elites is to give them more tax breaks? This and his other book make even horse manure smell not as bad  
 Picked this up to try out because of the ratings & price. Didn't do a thing for me.  Wipe it on, let it haze and wipe it off.  No difference.  
 I keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are, but I have never found this to be so.  He always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it.  He seems more at home studying statistics (which he includes everywhere) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics.  I always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper, surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world.  All his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone - just comments on them later.  Still lots of people think he is grea 
 I haven't read this book, but I have read the reviews.  This is not the M. Scott Peck of the The Road Less Travelled.  I just finished reading M. Scott Peck's "Glimpses of the Devil" in which he made reference to his first wife, Lily, as if they were still married so I am assuming that he is still married.  If you enjoyed the Road Less Travelled and found it to be a challenging and helpful book, this is NOT the same author and you will very likely be disappointed 
 I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book.   For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus.   Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original.   The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.  However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book.   In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee." If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now! 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 Up until I moved on to other authors, I had read pretty much everything Mercedes Lackey had written. My opinion is perhaps a bit biased now, since I'm no longer interested in her writing (and cringe somewhat when I read it); however, even back when I really loved what she wrote, this book never worked for me.  I'll try to avoid repeating what others have said, so except for the first point this will just focus in on some of what stood out to me. First of all (this one has been mentioned, but I wanted to underline it), I'm not sure how accurate it was as far as Native American beliefs and practices. If someone who is a Native American from the specific people group the main character hailed from would like to comment on this, I would be most interested (let's not get any more "Education of Little Tree" type books out there, shall we?).  Next, one of the things that annoyed me was the treatment of sex. Now, this is certainly at least partly based on my feelings towards sex in general as being something meant for marriage only. However, I got annoyed with the way that Jennifer's grandfather felt that sex would solve all of her personal problems (okay, maybe not ALL of them, but still). From my real life observation, if someone is stressed and dealing with all sorts of personal issues, sex isn't going to be anything more than (to paraphrase someone close to me) a bandaid covering up the splinter so you don't have to actually take the splinter out (i.e., a "solution" that lets you avoid the real problem). You might feel better for a little while, but it's not going to fix things. And considering the way things were between her and her former lover, I wasn't convinced that sex would help. Rather, I thought it would confuse things. They had reasons for breaking up, reasons that I didn't feel were fully dealt with. Jumping back into bed with each other wouldn't solve her problems, it would make them that much more painful a few [months, years, or however long it took] down the road when they had to break up again because they hadn't fully figured out whether they should be together or not. This is one of my main issues with Lackey's books; she uses sex far too lightly, without generally looking at some of the consequences that come in real life.  Finally, here's my biggest issue with this book (which also ultimately became one of my issues with Lackey's writing in general). In this book she seemingly bends over backwards to be openminded and fair towards people of all races, genders, religions, etc. She in fact states this several times in case the reader didn't get the point; everyone should be accepted, have equal rights, etc. So if this is her belief, why is it that EVERY SINGLE WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) male is an abusive, heavyhanded, racist, sexist, etc. jerk? (and I'm not 100% sure on this, but I seem to remember that every WASP female was abused, timid, and frightened, although generally wanting to be good) I know that WASP males have caused a lot of damage in the world; however, they aren't the only ones, and there are plenty of them that are great guys (and honestly, at this point in time, pretty much the only people groups out there, at least in any large numbers, are those who at one point in time in history conquered [and frequently did horrific things to] other people groups. WASPs just happened to be the most recent, and most successful worldwide, at doing this). This annoyed me so much that I couldn't appreciate much of the rest of the book.  So there you have it. Some aspects of the book were alright, but unfortunately they couldn't outweigh these negative issues for me 
 The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths.   Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL 
 I don't know why I keep buying these books - they are just so mediocre.  Boring and formulaic doesn't begin to describe it.  It took it with me on vacation and didn't even bother to bring it home to resell 
 My review for two stars is only because it was extremely hard going for me, as I have no mathematical or scientific background.  But I think that for those who love these subjects it would be an excellent book.  I for one struggled with it.  Although I did find some interesting points.  I didn't feel that I came away with any more knowledge from reading it, and my theory is that even if I come away with at least 10% more knowledge then it was a good book to read.    I have heard William Craig Lane debate, and he was succint in his technique, so I thought that this book would be like that, but for me it just wasn't.  But for all those who enjoy a book with graphs and equations you will love it.  For me though it was really hard going, and never really understood where he was coming from or indeed his conclusion.  Oh well.. 
 I was so excited when a friend (knowing how much I'd loved "The Secret Life of Bees") sent me a copy of "The Mermaid Chair." That excitement was dampened a bit when I read the story synopsis-- as a Catholic, I'm heartily tired of stories involving monks, priests or nuns having illicit affairs. Deciding to give Kidd the benefit of the doubt, however, I plowed ahead and started reading.  My initial opinion of the writing was poor, and it remained as such throughout the tome. In "Bees," Kidd wrote magically-- her words were as almost as sweet as the honey she penned about. This mermaid tale, however, was a completely different animal-- the style was totally altered, almost as though it was written by another (and much less talented) author. Basically, it didn't flow; it moreorless limped from chapter to chapter.  I also found the main character very hard to like or root for. I didn't mind that she was having a midlife crisis-- some people have their most interesting experiences as a result of such inner conflict-- but her reaction to it was childish, petulant and ultimately harmful to her supposed loved ones. For example, instead of telling her husband what's on her mind (a husband who, incidentally, is described as nothing but genial and accommodating), she runs away and has an affair. I would've been much more inspired by this character if she'd channeled her passionate energies into something else, something bold and brave and true-- NOT avoiding her husband (as though he, not she, were the reason her artistic aspirations were frozen) and having sex with a monk.  And yes, my reservations about reading a story involving a religious having sex were not without merit. I was particularly disgusted when, during one of their romps together, she tasted "the wine" in his mouth left over from Mass. Catholics believe that during the course of Mass, the wine changes into Christ's blood, so you can understand why I found that passage really quite offensive and sacriligious. And maybe that's why, when I grimly finished the book shortly thereafter, I deposited it in the wastebasket rather than in a donation pile-- I would hate to pass such a story on.  All in all, I found nothing to praise in this book, nothing that inspired me as "Bees" did, nothing that made me nod and smile and feel enriched afterward. Instead, I was by turns bored, irritated and offended. I didn't expect a "Bees" copycat, but I did expect, when leafing through those pages, to feel the magic again. It just didn't happen 
 Disappointed in the overall look and content of the book.  Would rate it a C+.  Helle 
 I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you 
 I'm not a big fan of short stories as it is, but I love the era of the 40's and 50's. Seeing as how that's the era these women are from, I figured I really enjoy this. Well, I was wrong. The book focuses more on the women when their older...much older.   But that wasn't why I didn't like this book. What I didn't like was the writing style. Not AT ALL. It was extremely choppy, and I found it to be difficult to follow in many places. And the women themselves...I just didn't care for them. They were a very weird bunch, and I thought they were a bit eccentric for no apparent reason.  Overall, not a book I recommend. But as I said, I'm also not a big short story reader. I picked this up thinking I was in for some easy, light reading...but that wasn't the case. Hope you have better luck with it 
 I bought this item a few years ago and then it just stopped working.  First it wouldn't shut off, then it stopped all together.  I would not recommend this item 
 This is the third Delphi product I have purchased for use with XM SkyFi2 system. Each Delphi product had to be returned because of problems; sound card problem, antenna connection would not maintain contact with signal, etc. The sound was very good when the systems were working. The purpose of buying the portable units was to use the SkyFi2 outside of the home. I gave up on the portable systems and now have the home kit for SkyFi2 connection to my home stereo system. So far so good. I have had it hooked-up and working one week. 
 Naturally, my hair is wavy, with very thin strands but piles and piles of it. My hair is somewhat difficult when it comes to straightening -- usually it looks fine when I leave the house, but comes completely undone after about four hours. So, when my last Conair straightener broke, I went out and invested my money in this one.  Overall, it's okay. It straightened my hair in one stroke, which is rare for me. However, it seemed to just suck all the moisture out of my hair, leaving it extremely dry and dull (which is definitely not good for a vegan such as myself, since my hair is already dry enough!). The movements were clumsy with this, and I occasionally snagged my hair or burned myself due to the plates unexpectedly shifting toward me. It didn't break, and it's still going just as strong as the day I first bought it.  This straightener had problems dealing with smaller amounts of hair, or the fine "baby hairs" around my forehead. And sadly, it couldn't keep my side bangs straight to save its life -- they were as wavy as ever two hours after I'd straightened it. This straightener does the most minimal job -- at least it straightens your hair somewhat -- but save your pennies for a straightener more worthwhile. 
 Having left my studies of analytical philosophy many years ago - a fervent Wittgensteinian and ardent admirer of J.L. Austin - I had been looking for a way to learn what has happened since I left. It's the kind information that doesn't get into the newspapers and magazines. Soames' book fills the bill nicely, tracing the large patterns of development and at the same time working through key arguments and controversies in some decent detail. It's no replacement for a series of courses and careful reading of original texts, of course, but neither is it glib or patchy. It serves an important purpose to provide perspective on a subject that has developed to a great degree within academic journals. I haven't yet discussed it with Eccles, Bluebottle or Major Bloodnok. 
 I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time.  It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning.  The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my ratin 
 Dr. Atkins has just rehashed his old work.  Same old thing.  The diet doesn't even work.  Ugh.  Save your money 
 This is the dullest of the CotC films so far, but it's too late for me to turn back now.  Much like the last 2 ones, it doesn't seem directly related to the original film, but just another variation on the basic setup.  The corn matters again this time, however, and He Who Walks Behind the Rows is back, though this time as a fire in a corn silo, for some reason.  For most part nothing really happens.  There is a plot, of sorts, involving the main characters brother who joined the Corn Cult and so on, but it's just another basic re-do where a pack of young people stumble into a town full of evil children.  They stand around for a long time, eventually some people die, but not in a particularly intriguing fashion.  David Carradine makes a brief appearence, and he's passably amusing, but the film hasn't got a whole lot else going for it.  Also, the head evil kid isn't very good, as has generally been the case in this series.  It's tough to make small children scary or intimidating, I guess.  The film does have an amusingly pointless stinger at the end, and once the killin gets started it's sufficiently amusing,  but it's mostly a whole lotta nothin.  Grade:  
 The only extraordinary thing about this film is how OW could take such a fascinating subject and drain the life out of it.  I found myself wanting this to be over about halfway through (after I dozed off).  Don't be fooled by the other review here.  They are the true fakes (if you know what I mean).  Save your money and save your time 
 This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless. 
 I bought this because my two and half year old nephew has enjoyed Hola Jalapeno for many months and I thought I'd try something new.  He loves to be read to but this one just won't keep his interest.  I'll keep trying.  Maybe when he's a bit older 
 This is a horribly written book, flawed by numerous instruction errors and miserable Quality Control and editing by the publisher. The premise and idea of this series is commendable, but as someone who teaches After Effects and Premiere, this was a sad experiment. I much prefer Adobe's Classroom in a Book, and I generally find much better third party titles than Adobe's. If possible, wait for more titles for the new version 6.5 to come out... authors will have had more time to catch up to the program than this particular volume 
 This book could've been much bette 
 2 disc, whats on the second disc.No listing of songs!Bought one before an only came with one disc,'Spirit of the 60's'Sign'd Not Again 
 If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story.  The end.   Instead, they end up having to scramble to try & make Christmas "happen" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home.  In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! Christ's birth.  I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it.  Why torture yourself?    It would have been a good story if they did this.  Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of "making Christmas happen."    A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read.  Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it 
 Is it any wonder this book has received no reviews? That would presuppose a level of bona fide "kulchur" among the modern masses. Instead, Pound enjoys a neofolk vogue because he was interested in Fascism and used a few euphemisms to refer to Jews. Neofolks LOVE that kind of ambiguity. Maybe they'll read the Cantos, and consider themselves fans of Pound, while completely missing the point of his work, contained in such books as the "Guide".  But you can't hold it against these innocent egotists. You can't expect scenesters to be genuinely interested in kulchur and old books. They want to LOOK COOL.   Read this book if you ENJOY POUND'S PERSONALITY and are concerned WITH YOUR LEVEL OF KULCHUR 
 I have never felt as compelled to write an online review of a product as I do right now...  First of all, the very title of this book is blatantly misleading.  And I believe this was intentional.  This isn't the science OF superheroes, this is the science AGAINST superheroes.  (Well, it is against all of them except the X-Men, but we'll get into that one in a bit.)  What the authors have done here is taken what could have potentially been a fun little ride through the land of superheroes, and turned it into a mean spirited trek through your most boring physics class.  After reading the title, you might expect to see a book describing the scientific aspects of how superheroes exist and function.  But you would be wrong.  Instead, the authors go well out of their way to disprove any notion that superheroes could exist.  I believe this was intentionally given a misleading title because they knew someone interested in superheroes would not be buying a book saying they are impossible.  I mean, come on... we all know they are impossible, be we would like to see science that shows what might be possible.  But this book does none of that.  This book is only about ripping the superhero genre to shreds.  Not only is the book 99% negative, but it is written in a way that is very degrading to fans of superhero based comic books.  Like other reviewers have said, it is as though the authors are just trying to bash comic books and fans of them.  Reading this book gives you the feeling that they would just love to tell us "Are you stupid?  Don't you realise this is impossible?!?"  The science isn't entirely accurate either.  For all of the looking down their noses at us that they do, these two enlightened people don't exactly have all their facts straight.  For example, in the chapter about Henry Pym, they describe how a person that is getting larger would actually become weaker with size, so that eventually he would not even be able to support his own weight.  So that means that my 36 year old body is impossible because I am alot bigger than I was when I was 5.  But yet, here I am.  Heck, maybe I'm a superhero...  I guess dinosaurs were impossible too, because they were pretty doggone big.  The authors also say that Pym shrinking down to ant size would increase his relative strength tremendously.  If this would be the case, at 5'-11" I can lift my own weight so that would mean that a person significantly smaller than me, such as a midget, should be able to lift many time his/her own weight.  I don't think so....  Now, the famous X-Men chapter...  As a believer in the Bible, I am deeply offended by this chapter.  Not one single scientific fact was made about the X-Men.  NOT A SINGLE ONE.  Instead, the authors used this chapter as a soapbox to deliver a long tirade about how they think Creationists are trying to deceive the world about our origins.  They go on to say that everyone who believes in Creationism thinks that the world was created on October 22, 4004 BCE!!!  Let me tell you, I believe that God created the Universe, but I have never heard this mess about October 22, 4004 BCE.  Through this entire chapter, they do nothing but ridicule and insult people who believe in God and Creation.  Then to top it all off, they end the chapter by saying the X-Men are not only possible, but probable in our future!!!!  So, we get to look forward to guys shooting lasers our of their eyes, people controlling the weather with their minds, people who can morph into perfect copies of other people, not to mention others who can walk through walls, freeze moisture in the air, shoot fire from their hands, etc... Hey, the authors said all this is probably going to happen in our future!!  (sigh)  This chapter alone was enough to make me stop reading this book.  It was not a very enjoyable read to begin with, but once I got to the end of the X-Men chapter I had enough.  And from other reviews, I see that the authors think Donald Duck is the shining example of a good scientific comic book.  As one other reviewer said... Talking Ducks....  To sum it all up, I don't see that there is any market for this book.  People wanting to know the science behind their favorite superhero are not going to enjoy this book because they will find out that nothing supports their favorite character, unless that character just happens to be blue and can teleport with a BAMF sound, which in that case the authors say that is entirely probable.  People who are not interested in superheroes are not going to buy this book for obvious reasons.  So who does that leave as the target audience of this book??  No one.  And that is exactly who I would recommend this book to 
 The Media Career Guide, by James Seguin, is unique in its intent - but that's not necessarily a good thing.  Books about résumés and interview strategies are a dime a dozen, but works focusing on making one's self an appealing candidate for a job in the many different forms of media are few and far between, perhaps for good reason.  Whether a person wants to work in TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, public relations or advertising, this book brings to light seemingly obvious tips that one might not come up with on his or her own.  However, many of the ideas in this book are SO obvious, they didn't need to be written in a book.  Strategies are outlined - step-by-step - for becoming more cognizant about improving one's skills.  The 34 preparation suggestions are divided into sections - "get started," "learn all you can learn," develop and attitude for success," "take action" and "know your field."  But just by looking at the section titles, one can see that there aren't any revolutionary ideas being presented here.  I will say that, because this book outlines many obvious things, people who have read the book should not have any excuse for not being prepared to get a media job, aside from being completely lazy.  Suggestions range from actively planning for a career in the media to places to look for more information to make one's self an expert in a specific area.  The tidbits of advice direct you to places to go for more information.  There's no specific help in this book, when there easily could have been; there are only suggestions as what somebody should start looking into, with ideas about how to do that.  The writer seems like he wants to go more in-depth at times but backs off.   Emphasis is placed on developing good habits before one enters the workforce and once a job is secured.  While every point is valid, again, many seem to state the obvious.  Everyone knows that you'll be a better job candidate if you're more qualified that other applicants.  Many of the author's suggestions just restate that idea in slightly more specific ways.  The book also contains an adequate list of resources for finding jobs.  I've seen comparable lists for job banks before.  People who have already searched for jobs probably won't find anything new in this book.  Also listed are publications and organizations to look into that could provide an extra edge to somebody seeking a communications career.  The book also contains a guide to what media jobs are actually out there, something that could be helpful to those who know they want to work in communications but aren't exactly sure what all is available.  People who know what they want to do might also be able to pinpoint their specialty using this section.  Realistically, however, people who are serious about media careers will already know all this information.  I learned nothing from this section 
 This book was very disappointing for me. I've heard of Dr. De Bono and expected much more than what he offers in this book. It's bascially an elementary book about common sense divided into different segments (hats). I would not recommend this book 
 Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version.  (For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM) 
 I was so excited about this product.  I love simple appliances and this one fit the bill.  However the filters were impossible to find and the whole thing stopped working after a month of use!  Don't buy this product.  Spend the extra money and get a better humidifier 
 Terrorists strike an America oil refinery with a small nuclear bomb. In steps Major Jason Richter, Army nerd extraordinaire, with his super CID exoskeleton. The hero of the hour saves a busload of kids, along with a beautiful reporter, and promptly gets placed on the newest war-on-terror team. The team starts to tackle the terrorist group responsible, but the team seems to be set up for failure with conflicting personalities and egos. The battles rage on around the globe, as Major Richter tries to pull the team together, find the mastermind behind the plots, and save his country from another disastrous attack.  Techno, yes; thriller, no. This book started out with promise and I really wanted to like it. But after the introduction of the major characters and gadgets, it quickly becomes cliched and predictable. The nifty new weapons systems would play much better with believable characters and a realistic plot. The pacing is fast, but the many twists and turns feel forced. Dale Brown is perfectly capable of writing exciting techno-thriller books with good characters - but this is not one of them 
 This type of story has come up before. There is at least one novel that I know of the Classic Trek series that is pretty much the same as this novel. This Novel is pretty much predictable in all senses, and you know, as well as I do, that none of the main characters ever die. Just the ones that are extras. Deana could have died, but she was saved. I don't recommend this novel if you want to read something that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Yet, this novel does keep you slightly intrigued if you let it 
 I've read this book and the previous version. While none of the advice is wrong or bad, I didn't feel like any of it was earth-shattering, either. Most of what's in here is common sense to someone who has a decent shot of getting into a top business school. It's a catchy title, and you may pick up a few tidibits, but I've found other books to be more useful. Also, this version is longer than the previous one, but the additional content doesn't seem to justify the high price 
 This book is not good. The author's style is good but the story goes nowhere.  The characters in the book are really more parodies of people rather than being fully developed.   Waste of time 
 The bigger the intellectual, the less truth you need in your words.   Sure you can believe in Jesus and the goddess, you just have to forget everything Jesus ever said. This is like believing in the political ideologies of Ghandi and favoring the military accomplishments of the Third Reich.   If you follow the ideas in this book, I can assure you that you do NOT believe in the Jesus of the Bible (remember, the real one?), but only a media image of a long haired man with a beard. One would hope you would take your faith more seriously than that.  
 A rambling, self-important, name-dropping, and pretentious work that I forced myself to finish.  The literary device of focusing on discussions with two fictional students during much of the book was annoying and an easy way to increase page count without requiring serious rigor. I have just started Galbraith's 'Money'; it seems much more robust, though admittedly of a slightly different focus 
 I'm good with computers and have used other architectural software, and this was most disappointing.  In fact, if I had not bought this on Amazon, I would have returned it to the local retail store with huge complaints.  It was difficult to install--buggy.  It had problems rendering a drawing and would often lock up.  The "objects" that you pull from its library can sometimes be opened and resized--and sometimes cannot.  Hardly intuitive at all.  Also disappointing was the way multiple stories did not synch up.  I had reasonable expectations for this software, but wish I had bought something else.  For $10 it would be a good purchase.  For anything over that, you are wasting your money.  Try another product, a demo first, or something.  But in my opinion this was a big waste of money 
 This was a below average graphic novel.  It did not do much for me 
 This is an extremely long, detailed, thorough and dense examination of how a 'nice Jewish boy' from Chicago during the Depression became lawyer to the local Mob, and ultimately to the underworld bosses of Las Vegas.  Sidney spent most of his life on the West Coast, far from his Chicago roots.  He was the grandson of one of six brothers who immigrated from the Ukraine in the late 19th Century.  Their story is emblematic of thousands, if not millions, of similar stories of immigrant striving toward respectability.  Sidney graduated from college and law school and weht to work as an attorney.  One of his original clients was reputed to be part of the Capone mob, and it was upward (or downward) from there, depending on your point of view.  The book is incredibly well researched, sourced and detailed.  In fact, thre's more on the underworld's machinations than there is detail on what made Sidney tick.  There's little or no insight about his personal opinions of some of his 'clients.'  This will appeal primarily to Californians, Chicagoans or students of the American 'Jewish Mafia' of the 1930s.  Or perhaps those with a connection with the decendants of the other Korshak brothers, which today are legion, and living the prosperous American dream on the right side of the law.  (It should be noted that Sidney was never indicted for anything, nor did he have so much as a speeding ticket on his record.)    It's doubtful many will stick with the minutiae all the way through 
 Pohl is a great writer. This is a horrible book. I picked up a copy of the hardcover for 1$ at a used book store, after reading half the book I wanted my money back. The plot is dull, unimagantive and boring. This book is a  fight againts continual bordem to read. Pohl recounts page afer page of  redunt "daily life" information. The plot creeps along at a  snail's pace without any suprises. I kept reading the book in the hope that  it would show some some hint of value, it never did. Simply not worth it 
 Way too sweet for beef jerky. It was similar to drinking a soda 
 The premise of this book, that because the minorities that tend to vote Democratic are currently growing while the caucasian population is remaning static indicates a rising Democratic majority, is seriously flawed.  If you told a Republican in 1930 that the African-American population would grow, he'd probably say "good." But after FDR, African-Americans stopped voting for "Lincoln's Party." Furthermore, while 89% of African Americans voted Democratic in 2004 (down by 2% since 2000), when polled on certain issues such as school vouchers, gay marriage, etc., they tend to side with Republicans. As for Asian and Latino voters on the rise, yes they did vote for Kerry, but the margin was 18% for the former and 9% for the latter. There is really no way, though, to predict which ways voting blocks will go ten or twenty years down the road (especially if they aren't really voting as a "block" now, which Latinos most certainly are not).  The economic argument is flawed also. While I am no expert on the subject, I have heard numerous economists who have said that small businesses are the 21st century economy. In the 2004 election at least, Republicans tended to focus on, and I would assume, receive, the votes of small business owners and employees, while Democrats focused on the working class.  Women votes were also near-even in 2004

 This is an ok book for new people, but it has several safty issues, and doesn't have the show cuts for many dogs, poodles. It also has the wrong cuts from some of the dogs. There are better books out there 
 Man oh man, what was once a great band has just done the unthinkable, they've gone and went commercial. I was hoping this wouldn't happen but when I heard last year that they'd start touring with their friend Dierks Bentley, who's nothing more than a golden boy in Nashville, my radar went up. Well, it's happened. I realize these Texas artists are getting noticed, but it blows me away that they go and change their sound so much to appeal to the mainstream. Randy Rogers was one of the better new outfits to come out in years, and it's a shame that this puppy sounds like a hundred other CMT acts out there. You can try and justify all you want, but this is not the same sound as they had before; this is fabricated assembly-line music. People may not like the negative reviews, but too bad. If the truth hurts, so be it. 
 Jonathan R. Wilson, the Pioneer McDonald Chair in Theology at Carey Theological College, seems to be irritated by the current conditions of the church in North America. His book, Why Church Matters, is a discussion on "practicing church" in today's culture. The ideas and information in Why Church Matters, make for a somewhat interesting and at times, entertaining read.  In the first section of the book, Wilson reviews and explains some of the practices of the church "that generate and sustain the life of the church." (p. 5) His second section then addresses some of the practices that he believes are in need of renovations. In the third section, Wilson uses "imagery" and "formation language" to describe the New Testament church. These sections seem to overlap and cover some of the same material. Even though the book is only 158 pages, it probably could have been condensed to 125 pages because of the overlap in content from chapter to chapter.   Overall, this book was a great disappointment from the start. In the first chapter, Wilson attempts to use a word that Aristotle and Alasdair MacIntyre use frequently in there writings. He insists that the word "telos" be used instead of words like "goal," "purpose," or "orientation." Wilson says that the word "telos" encompasses all of these words and more. This may be true, but throughout the book, he uses the word "telos" in places that the word "purpose" or "goal" would do just fine.  This idea of using new words and new language for the practice and philosophy surrounding the church is prevalent in the book. Wilson devotes much of the book to establish his views that the current "language" in theology and the church is not sufficient. He promotes the use of new or different words, especially words that indicate imagery. Throughout the book, he uses the word "community" in the place of "church." This causes great concern because he views a "community" as any group of believers. He seems to imply that anywhere there are some believers making up a "community," there is a church. The changes that he desires makes with the language are dangerous and should be avoided.  One major problem with this book was his use of Scripture. Wilson used some Scripture in a few chapters, but for the most part, the Scripture references in the book are scarce. Some of his ideas and propositions are not scripturally based and his applications to those ideas and propositions are even further from the truth.  At points, it was difficult to understand what he really wanted to get across to the reader. He even seems to contradict himself in a few places. For instance, he believes that worship can be used as a witness to the world. Wilson says that some worship services should be in very public places, such as, parks, the mall atrium, or in the community center. (p. 33) Later in the book, Wilson says that Baptism must take place inside the church building since it is not for the public to view. (p. 107) (I thought this would be something that could or should be public!) He mentions in many other places that the whole activity (and most important activity) of the church is worship. Either Wilson is saying that baptism is not worship, or he has trouble remembering what he wrote earlier. Some of what Wilson said was very helpful. He has a great desire to have true worship and practice before God. Many of the statements he makes about the condition of the church are right on target. He knows that there is a need for change, but the methods he gives for changing are questionable. There are sections in which Wilson is biblical and accurate, but because of some of the inaccurate applications, the reader must read the book with great discernment. After reading this book, one must think that either Jonathan Wilson is part of the Emerging Church or that his thoughts and ideas are not solid thus they must be emerging. You should not waste your money on this book. A much better book to buy and read would be Philip Ryken's book, "A City on a Hill." 
 I like a few other readers was excited to start this book after reading so many great reviews... what were they all thinking?? This book was so boring and the back and forth between then and now was painstakingly slow. The main character was so unlikable, as a child and as an adult. Her fascination with her brother Matt, was not fully explained, and really all the characters could have been written better. The layout of the book I also felt was badly edited. I literally had to force myself to finish it because I figured I'd already spent so much of my time I figured I had to know the end. What a let down.... I found it way to corny and anti-climatic. Seriously, if you're on the fence about this one, keep on searching. Leave this book alone, you'll be doing yourself a favor 
 This book was terrible, and I would not recommend it for anyone, especially young teens. Although I do understand the author's intentions, the grammar and punctuation were incorrect. Issues such as an eating disorder and incest were present and were never really dealt with or handled properly. Overall, the story was very unrealistic. I had to make myself finish reading it, despite wanting to quit many times. It was not exciting and didn't keep my interest. Not recommended at all 
 There is something about the fact that this vampire uses or needs an airplane to fly around from place to place that just takes away from any horror this film could really create.  Stephen King's "The Night Flier" has a very poor plot and an even poorer cast of characters.  Shame on you Stephen King!!  Moreover, there is not one character in the entire movie that you can relate to or even sympathize with in the slightest.    The movie centers around a selfish and crass newspaper reporter who is trying to track a serial killer who flies his plane from airport to airport in search of victims.  It becomes increasingly apparent that this serial killer is not human.  Now, the only reason this film does not get a 1 star rating is that the vampire is rather horrifying looking and the ending is slightly creepy, but everything else about this movie fails to evoke any interest in me whatsoever.  If you really want to see a good vampire flick, you should watch the original "Salem's Lot", directed by Tobe Hooper (not that "new" garbage that came out recently on TNT), which is one of, if not the scariest movie of all-time.    To be quite frank, I'm reluctant to give "The Night Flier" even 2 stars, but, as I said above, there are a couple of creepy/scary elements to it.  If you see it on TV, you should check it out for yourself, but it's not worth a penny to me.  
 I bought these to replace a pair of sony fontopias I had. I loved the sonys but was trying to save some money and most of the reviews seemed favorable. While they are ok earphones I was dissapointed with the sound range and quality. They really dont block out much ambient noise and the fit is not very comfortable. For 20.00 they work but I wouldnt order them again 
 I have owned several timex ironman watches over the years. Loved 'em all. I don't if amazon sent me one with an almost dead battery, or if it's a flaw in the watch. However, when punching through the modes, everything is REALLY SLOW. If I go to alarm, I have to wait a few seconds for it to appear, then wait a few more when I choose to modify it. Not quick an easy like my other ironmans. Great features though, if it wasn't for this annoying delay, 5 stars easy. So I don't know to blame amazon or timex for this. Either way, it is a problem that dropped the score for me 
 This book is mostly a kitchen sink approach to speed training methods and is a sure fire perscription for overtraining.  And as previous reviews have pointed out, the book does not provide an overall logic that helps the athlete or coach properly integrate the training elements.  The book does not properly explain how the components of its sytem interact with each other and how they should be balanced against each other when determining the needs of a given individual athlete.  In addition, many of the techniques, most notably overspeed training, are highly dubious and most likely counter productive.  For those interested in proven speed training methods, I highly recommend Training for Speed by Charlie Francis, which is light years ahead of SportSpeed.  Also be on the lookout for Charlie's new training manual which should be released by the end of 2002 and will make every other book on speed training obsolete 
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 If an author choses to write a politcally charged novel, there will be bias. What I look for is some balance in the arguments. But, like his brother Rush, David writes with blinders on and misses the obvious contradictions in his arguments. The Democrats are not like Republicans! Of course not. The current Republican party is overwhelmingly an ideological, lock-step plutocratic mob who won't tolerate open discussion of an issue. Democrats on the other hand are diverse, open minded and welcoming of new ideas and thoughts. David Limbaugh would have you believe that is chaos. Open, intelligent discussions are what is missing in the Republican party right now.  A book does not have to be well written to put across the author's theme, and the ideas he is promoting, but when it is dully written, poorly researched and obvious in its misinterpretation of issues and situations it is difficult to give it much credence.  Basically I have read this book before, several times. There is nothing new, in fact it sounds like a few days of Rush on the radio, usually wrong and overwhelmingly insulting to anyone who can think for themself.  So, all I see here is an poorly written dull diatribe of the same old propaganda from the right - "Don't confuse us with the facts we already have been told what to think." 
 I ordered this book for my son because I thought it would be a cute and entertaining story.  I was extremely disappointed to find out that it was neither cute nor entertaining.  The plot and characters are very shallow and simplistic, although that is not the problem I have with this book.  The problem is the writing style.  It is written in a very colloquial style and has no literary flair whatsoever.  If you are looking for a sweet, funny undersea story to read your young one, look elsewhere.  This one lacks quality and refinement 
 Pity the student using this textbook for a Differential Equations course. The Boyce & DiPrima text is unduly cumbersome with lacking explanation and poorly choosen examples throughout.   Many problems given in the text are tedious, and are indicated as being "technologically intensive." This is fine: in today's workplace, one can anticipate using a computer to solve problems. Unfortunately, none of my math professors will let me bring out my laptop on an exam. In some of the chapters, almost every problem is indicated as being "technologically intensive." If the computer-oriented problems weren't bad enough, the examples in the text are. Most of these are sorely unclear. I think that Boyce & DiPrima must have been writing in Fermat's marginal notes style when composing this text. Many times the omitted steps (which the authors sometimes regard as "it is clear that") require substantial algebraic and calculus manipulation to achieve the indicated results. Certainly I have no qualms about a text leaving out algebraic or even trigonometric simplifications, but what's left out of the Boyce & DiPrima examples is truely excessive. Worse, still, the examples are often very generic to a single type of problem. Thus, while one type of problem in the exercises might have good examples to instruct students on how to achieve solutions, the rest of the exercises often lack example altogether. Explanation and orientation to applied math is poor. The authors jump suddenly from a confusing theory discourse to an application without bridging the two. Many times I was left puzzled by how the text was proceeding. Still many more times I set the book aside in frustration.  This book does, however, have redeeming values. I like how all of the problems have their solutions provided in the back. If only other math textbook authors took the hint: students won't know how well they're doing if they cannot confirm their results! Also, the included software is good. I found it easy to use and helpful for the computing problems. I wish, however, more attention was given to this software in the text (like small projects using the software with each chapter). These benefits unfortunately do not overcome the tremendous flaws with the Boyce & DiPrima text.  Overall, this is one of the worst math books I have encountered. Rife with poor explanation, a confusing style, and poor exercise sets, the Boyce and DiPrima textbook is bound to cause grief for most students. The student's solution manual is helpful, but offers only little more explanation than the textbook. If you are hapless enough to have this text as a course requirement, I recommend that you either swap classes to try and get a course with a different book - or - be prepared to spend many long hours with tutors or your professor.  Good luck.  [...

 He writes with a lot of descriptive detail, to a fualt. Every person he mentions gets their biography put in. Way too much extra junk about people no one would ever here of.

 If you think your getting the Super Bowls, you're not. It's a glorified season in review and and 20 minutes of each "Super Bowl" is dedicated to the actual SB. This is nothing more than the stuff they show on the off season when there is nothing else to keep the NFL fans fed. I'm going to try and return this, but I'm sure it won't happen.. 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 As I say in my Amazon's AYA page I'm a history buff and thought this film will show some interesting issues of the mysterious life of spies.  Well... it doesn't. The film show some interesting issues of Sylvia Kristel abilities, but for watching her aptitudes at her best you must see "Emmanuelle" saga.  If you want to see some verisimilar tale about Mata Hari you should refer to two of the previous versions: "Mata Hari" (1931) starring unforgettable Greta Garbo and Ramon Novarro or "Mata Hari" (1964) starring Jeanne Moreau and Jean-Louis Tringtignant.  The present movie is sub-par in every item you may choose to evaluate. Skip it! Reviewed by Max Yofre 
 I got sucked in by the title--it is a good one. Unfortunately, the quality goes down from there.  This book is just incredibly naive about product development in the technology industry. Suggesting that the primary mantra of technologists is, "If we build it, they will come," the author (a self-proclaimed change expert) uses a mixture of 20/20 hindsight and shifting definitions to explain why a variety of stupid ideas (Webvan, satellite phones) failed. As to the success stories--like flat-panel TVs--people buy them because they're "cool." Thanks for the insight, Pip.  I read this right after finishing "The Long Tail"; a book that I expected to be a stretched-out version of a magazine article, that was surprisingly interesting and full of reasearch-driven insights. This is written more like a long, smarmy movie review. Unless you're marooned on a desert island with it, you'd be much better off re-reading, "Crossing the Chasm. 
 The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that, the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book.  I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it.  Without those details, the book seemed "unfinished".  It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.  Boring in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                            
 First off, there will be spoilers so if you want to read this book and don't like to know anything before you read it (like me) then don't read on!  What was this? I love Wendy Wasserstein as a playwright. I couldn't wait to read this book! I thought that it would be a witty satire on New York's "finest" (not the firefighters, the Upper East Siders) after 9/11. I was sorely mistaken.  The first few chapters are delightful and engaging, but soon, you long for the book to go somewhere... 307 pages later you shut the book realizing that it never did!  The political agenda being pushed was nauseating. I daresay it bordered on propaganda!   I liked not one character in this entire book- not one. At the beginning I thought that this was so that Ms Wasserstein would make a point later... SHE NEVER DID.  You can tell Wendy was an excellent playwright from the vivid descriptions of scene. It was written very visually.  I hate to say it, but this book's critical acclaim comes only from Ms Wasserstein's previous success as a playwright and her untimely death. Had she lived she would have discovered that she most certainly wasn't a novelist and should have spent her time writing what she is truly genious at- plays 
 I agree with the other reviewer who says this is a great book for those who cannot think for themselves.

Most of the given mix names are wrong, and there's a lot of dreadful spelling on the packaging too - "Echo and the Bunneymen"; "Scritti Polliti" and so on. More importantly, this set in places isn't what it says on the tin. With a couple of the tracks, such as The Cure's "A forest", compiler Dorian Wathen (whose smarmy sleevenotes are also unwelcome) has ignorantly included mixes from the 12" singles on the assumption that they must be extended versions. They aren't - as with many '80s singles, the only difference between the 7" and the 12" single would be the inclusion of an extra B-side. Including straight album versions is also pointless. The running order also jumps around horribly - who in their right mind would stick The Cure next to Aztec Camera, or "Hip hop be bop" next to Monsoon? Many of the tracks here have doubtless been included because they're cheap to licence nowadays (Kid Creole et al). But this has been at the expense of choosing mixes that add anything interesting to the standard versions. Of all the mixes included here, only those by Soft Cell, Tears For Fears and Propaganda are particularly innovative. A second volume has already been issued, and it looks like this shoddy series is set to run and run .. 
 I love Philip K. Dick's books (almost all of them, and I'm pretty sure I've read just about all of them over the years). But I have a strong suspicion that he wrote Now Wait for Last Year when he was a kid and had it published after his writing credentials had been secured. In the book, he uses a lot of big words (for an S.F. writer), but he doesn't seem to know how to use them properly. And he doesn't know how to use the English language properly, either. There's no way this book could have been published on its own, with no famous author's name on it. The plot is excellent, and true PK Dickian. But I had a VERY hard time finishing it because of the astonishingly bad writing (it's his style, but the awkwardness of the syntax and word usage is like driving on a pot-holed road). Any other book of his is better. Read this one last 
 I have always enjoyed Johansen's books but they are getting pretty predictable with the female protagonist and the male protagonist at odds with each other, building into an obsession and her finally succumbing to his charms. Its the same story with her other female protagonists as well. Other than a little different type of killer, these stories are as redundant as a Victoria Holt gothic novel and I gave those up many years ago for the same reason 
 I can't believe this book was a best seller. Even more, I can't believe I read the whole thing. Here's my nitpicking beef with the premise: this secret cabal is intent in permanently silencing the witnesses to the downed "weather balloon" in an attempt to keep the world from knowing we are not alone and breaking out in global panic. The span of time in the book is about a month. Yet in that time there is no panic, there is no exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer, there's nothing! There's nothing because the witnesses aren't saying anything. A few thought the whole crash was a hoax, another few were too embarrassed to say anything for fear of being ridiculed, and the one or two who did tell someone else what they saw weren't believed. There was really no reason for this Organization to go to all the trouble and expense to kill the witnesses off 
 Bought Ken Henderson's Guru's Guide to T-SQL, hoping to build on my (very) basic skills as a beginning developer.  Looked very promising and I was really looking forward to working through it using the code in the book and on the enclosed CD.  However, there is no cross-reference in the book to which files go with which code samples, resulting in a lot of hunting around to find the right files.  And then, quite a few of the code samples simply won't run.  Even with the corrections referred to in the Errata section on his website, I got many more errors than I can fix.  Between trying to find the correct sql files from the cd, and trying to fix the errors, I've pretty much abandoned the book altogether.  Not much use trying to learn from bad code.  Wouldn't spend the money on this one, if I had to do it over 
 This book should only be read by master level film students highly interested in every single director, film and plot summary of every movie ever made.  There are no summaries of the main points and this book should NEVER be used as a college core classroom book.

 The Competitive Enterprise Institute exists to serve the interests of business.  Their mission is to make money, and the more the merrier, and to hell with the consequences for the future.  Scientists exist to serve the cause of objective truth.

I believe the scientists.  And I can perceive global warming happening with my own senses

 I havn't heard this album, so I'll do a review of RBX in general.        I've heard him only on the Marshall Mather's LP' "Remember Me", and if his performance on that track is reflective of his other work, then there is no reason for anyone to buy this.  Half of his verse on that track don't even rhyme!!  Plus, his voice is more like talking in a possessed way then rapping.  Here, I'll paste his verse from "Remember Me.":  For this one it's the X, you retarded?

 I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.  The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell. 
 The authors brief treatment of what are very complex topics will lead readers to falsely believe that they can trade these markets with little training. It appears that the authors basically cut and pasted brief paragraphs about a variet of topics and called it a book. Other reviewers have called it a 'big picture' book, the truth is it is a complete waste of time and money. 
 I read this book expecting a combination literary analysis and "how to date" book, explaining the virtues and flaws of the characters in "Pride and Prejudice" and how they relate to our times.  It was that, in part, but I found myself increasingly annoyed at her giggle-with-me style of writing, and downright furious by her assumption that anyone who admires or resembles Lizzie or Darcy is, of course, a good Christian. Some of us consider ourselves to be kind and decent people and aren't Christian at all.  In the end,I found it beyond disappointing; I found it insulting 
 Country singers either sing about being drunk, drinking, having sex, or being patriotic. Well not that last one anymore, since 9-11 is a few years old. Hasnt anyone ever heard of quailty music anymore? Listen to Hank Williams or Marty Robbins. Thats real music. Hank sings about drinking but he actully wrote his songs, not like 90% of the country artist today. Plus, Hank can sing better then anyone in country today. 
 I normally don't put a book down without finishing it, especially one in the genre of classic American literature.  However, Hemingway's English translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that I could not get past them.  The use of "thy" and "thou" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English.  Quoting the characters as asking, "How do you call yourself?" instead of "What is your name?" is downright silly.  If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  Regardless, who needs a literal translation?  How is "How do you call yourself" better than "What is your name"?  And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English?  I found these "translations" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2.  I get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past 65 years don't speak Spanish.  
 I teach Statistics for a living, and this book replaced the book by Wiers, a move that I have berated the folks that do our purchasing ever since. The other Stats lecturer felt the same, and we have ended up using old copies of the prior book. For example, the book gives a miserly single page to explain Quartiles, and has very little in the way of examples that are helpful. If you HAVE to have it because your school dictates, you have to have it, but if you want to buy a book for the purpose of teaching yourself Stats, look elsewhere 
 Shangri La, that heaven on earth, is under attack. It's the 1960s, and the Chinese army is at the height of its ideological zeal for the Cultural Revolution. Originally, that army was marching against native Tibetan culture, in an attempt at forced assimilation of the disputed territory. Legend, then clues to that edenic valley begin to emerge, and then ...  I won't spoil the story. One family leads the hunt for Shangri La: a corrupt General Zhang, a son burning with missionary zeal for the revolution, and a daughter with quiet doubts about the party. A character from Hilton's original story learns of the threat, and leaves Shangri La to avert the threat. Leaving, of course, is a death sentence unless he returns soon enough, but the hero puts the safety of Shangri La ahead of his own.  This post-hoc collaboration never really captured my imagination. The writing is good enough, except for an especially magical resolution to the threat. I don't see it as a sequel, so much as an unrelated story in the same setting. That could have been good, but the characters never enticed me. The plot was very plain, an intellectual dead end: things happen, they're resolved, and that's it. Nothing more to think about.   Some people seem to this one - just not me.  //wiredweir 
 Extemely thoroughly researched, but author has gone astray with his novel, burdening the narrative with extraneous detail and long digressions that have nothing to do with the plot, which is convoluted and unconvincing. Characterization is weak,and, overall, the author seems to have ventured too far afield from his own expertise. That is, he seems to lack most of the tools of good fiction writing. Astonishing that the publisher seems to have put a fair amount of money behind pushing this book. 
 I bought this audio CD set at the Borders store, without the opportunity to preview the narration. Had I been able to do so, I probably never would have purchased it, let alone paid full bookstore price for it. But I needed an audiobook for my long drive the next day, so I relented.   Lesson learned.  The audio quality is very insonsistent, at at times very poor, having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording.   While the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical and geopolitical details of the Middle East, it does read very much like a history text. With the amount of detail presented, and the wide scope of coverage from one end of Europe reaching into the former Soviet states and beyond, one immediately feels the need for visual aids (maps, timelines, etc.) as guidance.   The reader's narration is monotononous, with a very constant cadence which dulls the senses. Each sentence sounds the same as the last. This has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of information presented as no more significant than any other, and so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity. After a while, the narration becomes little more than background noise. No information is retained by the listener 
 Dr. Cutler barely mentions the acupuncurist from whom she learned her methods, but it was probably Dr. Devi Nambudripad or someone trained by her. So skip the copier and get your information from the woman who discovered a way to truly eliminate all allergies, not just food sensitivities. Her book, Say Goodbye To Illness, is packed full of testimonials, some which include phone numbers and email addresses, which are truly miraculous. She also has a research foundation which has verified the effectiveness of her method, which is called NAET. Nambudripad's materials are much more comprehensive, and there are a lot more NAET practitioners around the country than there are BioSet practitioners. Dr. Cutler does talk more about diet and enzymes than NAET does, but it is also old info you could get in any natural healing book. I am disappointed I wasted my time on this book and will stick with  NAET 
 The only reason I rated this two stars was because my bird could care less about this CD.  I originally was online with some bird websites.  I have a cockatiel and she is so whiney (squawking - screaming) when you leave the room.  One of the reviewers said this CD did the trick for his bird.  Well I think I have a special needs bird :) The CD itself is soothing for me.  However, it doesn't do anything to quiet my needy cockatiel 
 After buying a book for about $80 I expect to get value for my money. I was extremely disappointed to note that just one week after using the textbook (and solving exactly one homework assignment of 4 problems) the pages began to come out. I have seen other friends who bought the book have a similar problem. The contents of the book deserve 4 stars. But the lousy binding pulls down its rating to 2 stars 
 This song is so dirty and ugly - both the lyrics and the tune.  I guess it's a fun song if you like to party, but partying is not for me.  The Dirrty video goes with the song perfectly.  By that I mean it's also dirty and ugly 
 I bought this for my wife to replace a copper one she really liked.  She just touched it to her head for less that two seconds and decided it was not for her.  I asked the company accept it as a return or part exchange for a copper one and they refused. 
 Think like I do would be a better title for this book . It is clearly an indoctrination into the leftist,liberal,atheist mind set . This book does not necessarily give you the tools to think for yourself rather it very cleverly sites useful information in order to corral the reader into believing in Mr.Blackburn's political agenda . Buyer beware  
 FIVE STARS, NOT TWO....F.F. Bruce is well known and respected far and wide for his honesty as a Christian scholar and apologist. This slim volume, 123 pgs, is true to form despite that as a Christian Bruce has a pre-ordained agenda to defend. Consider his painful honesty in this statement: "indeed, it may be we know nothing certain about the teacher into whose mouth the narrative is put; the story of Jesus as it has come down to us may be myth or legend, but the teaching ascribed to him, whether he was actually responsible for it or not, has a value all its own." How unlike the rabid fundamentalists who insist ever word is inspired of God, error free. He touches on many problem areas, but unfortunately does not develop them as he could have. Some areas not touched are more developed in his contributions to the book "Hard Sayings of the Bible", but even there, some elementary obvious problems, such as the two differing birth accounts of Jesus in Matthew vs. Luke, or the differences in the passion week account of John vs. the synoptics are mentioned in passing, but not developed. "The N.T. documents;are they reliable" thus introduces one to the existence of such areas of controversy, but that is all. It does more to establish the historicity of the accounts as being in the general time period they claim, particularly via Luke, with no less than eighteen historic contemporaries to challenge the reader to test the account validity. He reviews traditional Christian arguments to establish the accounts reliability such as what caused Paul to take such a direct about face from intense persecution to being a foremost leader in Christianity, yet acknowledging in the same chapter that Paul, whose writings are prior to the gospels, is only mentioned in Luke/Acts. Thus while doing a good job to establish the historicity of the New Testament accounts, Bruce also does not hedge on the internal problems of consistency of theology and event accuracy in reporting. He also acknowledges Mark being almost entirely incorporated into Matthew & Luke, and the Q document. Very recommendable due to it's honesty, and a good book for those beginning the subject, but lacking in development in looking at some of the specific events mentioned.    
 Tsukiyama knows hwo to write beautifully, BUT her metaphors and poeticisms feel too contrived. This novel is for lonely, flighty housewives. If you enjoy daytime soaps and/or exoticized perversions of the Asian culture, you'll love Dreaming Water 
 Wow, they actually put this "anti-classic" on CD.  Seriously, this is a very bad album.  Practically none of the "superstars" can sing, other than Jimmy Hart, and they are mostly stuck with dumb novelty songs.  Not that they fare too well when they sing "serious" songs.  Nikolai Volkoff has a decent baritone voice, but his thick accent renders "Cara Mia" unintelligible.  Probably the worst singing here is by Roddy Piper, although Captain Lou Albano gives him a run for the money.  If you are a fan of bad celebrity singing, you should get this album 
 After reading the "Other Bolyne Girl" I was keen to read another novel by Philippa Gregory. However, this was a very disappointing read, it is  poorly written, the story was not engaging and there was little substance.I could not even bring myself to finish this novel 
 This was the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. Don't waste your money. 
 If you're looking for some of "Jumping Joe's" classic blues (See Rick "Shaq" Goldstein's previous FIVE STAR review of "BLUES DELUXE"!) this is not the CD for you. If you want middle of the road rock guitar, and not the full "smoldering, cauldron, of thunder and lightning, guttural, volcanic, power, vocals, that "Jumping Joe", is capable of, this is for you. For a true "Jumping Joe" blues fan, the only thing this CD will do for you, is complete, your collection of his music, and you won't wonder if you missed something. In closing, a personal note to "Jumping Joe: "please record more classic electric blues! When you put out something like "Blues Deluxe" you are truly the greatest living electric blues man under 70 years old! This CD is beneath you and your loyal blues, "street gang! 
 Now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Bukowski fan. Post Office is a great novel and Women is pretty damn good also, but this is just awful. If this was his first ever novel, it would never have been published. Bukowski always writes about how he never got anything into print for 25 years and if it was anything like this then I can believe why. Pulp, is just a very bad book. The story is stupid, the plot is a mess, the characters are dumb. The only good thing about it is it's short. It's a shame to read something so bad from someone I used to love to read. Stay well away from this book, you will only be very disappointed 
 I wanted to express my disappointment with Sony for dumping these films on the market in the FULL FRAME, pan & scan format.  These films should have been made available in their respective WIDESCREEN aspect ratios (2.35 for Gidget and 1.85. for the other two).  The films themselves are a lot of fun, especially the first Gidget with the great Sandra Dee, but the joy is quickly snuffed out by the fact that almost half of the picture is missing.  How about a PROPER release showing these films a little respect?  
 This story was about a young brother trying to make it in life. I have to admit that I was excited to read this book, and it let me down.  I didn't like how Bobby let Pearl walk all over him.  I don't think Bobby Dallas was portrayed as a "Do Right Man" at all, but rather a wimp.  During the first half of the book, I waited for him to get a back bone, which he never did.  From there on the whole story was slow. I was bored about continually reading about him and his radio job.   This was a slow read for me, I skipped a few chapters just so I could find out what finally happened in the end

Ms. Orman makes it very clear in her disclaimer that you would be foolish to use the forms without the advice of an attorney and CPA.  Read the disclaimer for yourself.

 What a wonderful insight into British and Scottish history.  Leanda de Lisle's book is as good as any Masterpiece Theater with the added benefit of true history.  While Elizabeth refused to name a successor to the crown in fear of an overthrow, she continued to lopped of heads (Mary Queen of Scots needed a couple extra whacks to hit the basket) and imprison rivals in the Tower of London. James, Mary's son,  was somewhat offended at the axing of Mom and refused to attend Elizabeth's funeral. James' crowning removed the Catholics from dominance and Protestants where now the religion of the crown. James feign promises to Catholics but continued to take land and power from them. The havoc this cause was plot after plot of assassination of James and James, in turn,  imprisoning and killing the `traitors.'  You begin to see that Shakespeare had a lot of material to work with, without going to far from the actual events.  Twist and turns, deceit and treachery, this book is a great read and I highly recommend it to both the causal reader and persons interested in English history 
 THe Book is great, but the seller took forever to send it. I got it three weeks after i Ordered it. the rest of my books came within 3-6 days 
 This is worthless and they say it's refundable, until you read the fine print and realize it's only if you bought the entire product line. It is crap and doesn't do anything. Don't waste your money, drink milk and your hair will grow. This does not work 
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 I bought this book with a basic knowledge of HTML but very little knowledge of Javascript. Being a fan of other "Dummies" books, I thought this would be a great place to start learning Javascript. Do I feel ripped off! In the Introduction, the author states the book is for those with little or no knowledge of Javascript, which I don't think at all to be the case. She claims to use "real-world examples", most of which I find to be fairly abstract and very poorly explained. She also claims that all the sample codes are contained on the CD-ROM, which is a flat out lie, the applications are similar but the coding is very different from the book, which combined with the author's hard-to-follow explanations leaves the reader very confused and frustrated. On top of all that there are several typos, one of which refering to Microsoft Windows as a word processing program, and poorly written HTML, missing several tags. The author definately knows Javascript, but how good she is as an author is questionable 
 I subscribe to Parents, Parenting and Child magazine and will renew all but the one to Child. It's full of ridiculous fashion spreads (like I'm going to spend $50 on a t-shirt for my 15-month old), useless travel information and near-advertising features on the newest, most expensive items I 'need' for my child. The actual articles are no better or worse than what's in the other mags, and I don't find there's nearly as much information in the magazine as in the others.  As other reviewers have said, it is beautiful. However, it's thoroughly impractical unless you're one of those people who plan to shop at Neiman's for your child...not that there's anything wrong with that 
 From a lifelong lover of L&H films, zero stars, unless negative numbers are an option. These films are lousy through and through, and no degree of print quality or extras or low price or anything else could make me want them. They are painful to watch and about as humorous as Henry Daniell playing Doctor Moriarty. In deference to the two funniest men who ever lived, these atrocities should be burned along with the rest of the 1940s garbage forced upon Stan and Ollie after Roach sold their contracts.  If you really like Laurel and Hardy, do yourself a favor and get the 21-disc L&H set from Amazon.uk. It contains all their shorts (sound and silent) and some of the early movies. It also contains  the foreign language versions, in which L&H and most of the other actors actually speak their lines in Spanish, French, etc. Further, it includes different versions of certain titles.  For "Bonnie Scotland" and "Fra Diavolo," get the separate 2-disc set in NTSC. You'll have to purchase a region-free, PAL converting DVD player, but they are widely available in the United States and will play anything. (Don't buy a cheap one--the good ones are hardly expensive. 
 This is a bubble gum type of book that does not teach anything about making money on the markets. It is a platform to sell Investor Business Daily services. If you want to learn trading look for articles written by Toby Crabel or Arthur Merrill, even Linda Raschke. They are full time professional money managers that happend to write few articles... some of them you can probably find on Ebay for cheaper... 
 Even if I agreed with Gupta's arguments, I would still have to admit this is a dry, dull, pompous tome that will bore the pants off anyone. As it is, his arguments are ridiculous. They are vague, airy, tenuous attempts to link Harry to some sort of notion of contemporary culture but its never definate. It is amazing how much time he spends pontificating instead of analyzing. If you can see through all the smoke and mirrors, he has stumbled upon a few good categories for looking at the series (like "Blood"), but his analyses are very superficial and condescending. Worst of all, as others have noted, his reading of the books is completely inadequate. He's barely read them, beyond being able to recite the basic plot, and sometimes wrongly. He has merely attached a few of his own ideas vaguely to the Harry Potter series, with absolutely no sensitivity or real engagement. Gupta is yet another (male) critic who has been able to get a lazy book on Harry Potter published. This is a complete waste of time and money: keep reading Harry on your own and wait for some good studies to come out. (The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter is pretty good) 
 I'd been meaning to read this book for a long time, and I realize that it's considered a "classic", so I was surprised and disappointed when I finally got around to reading it. Basically, Holt describes various situations where children are playing and learning. If I hadn't already observed the same kinds of things with my own children, maybe this would have been enlightening. If you're someone who's spent time with young children, I don't think you'd get much out of this book. Perhaps if you haven't, then it might be interesting. 
 This is the worst product I have ever bought. In fact, I had bought 3 of this disaster and had to throw all away as useless. Its one function in life is to hold coffee, and it can't do that because the lid falls off if there is even slight wind. If you want to buy this product, just flush money down the drain 
     This was my first reading of anything by Franzen.I picked this book up at the same time as I got "Corrections".I decided to read this book first to get a feel for his work,but must admit was very disappointed.   I found that trying to get anything out of these essays was like looking for a white dove in a snowstorm.Obviously,he believes he has what it takes to be a good novelist.Maybe he is well versed in the techniques of writing,but he doesnt seem to know what he wants to say to the reader.His essays seem to be an attempt at observation,but he can't seem to pull his thoughts together and present a conclusion to the reader.   His concern about the literary novel going the way of the vinyl disc or the rotary phone,reminds me that it is the message not the medium that is important.   Maybe he has found his calling as a teacher of literary mechanics and should just leave the writing of novels to the gifted who know what they want to say and have the fire in their belly to pursue that path.   In his last essay ,it appears he drifts somewhere between being liberal or socialist minded;and maybe that is the problem.He is not happy with the way things are,doesn't know what would satisfy him and can't suggest any solution.Maybe he should start searching out some people who are positive,satisfied and successful.   Oh well,I guess I'll still give "Corrections" a try.Let's hope I like it better than this one 
 Only mildly accurate, the clumsy mix of true Gaelic forms along with Anglicizations leaves me a bit put off. This might make it useful to many, but it is not at all formal in structure. There are also some names with variations given that are just ridiculously old. Noone uses the root 'dub' in place of 'dubh.' Some truly ancient names are included, but their selections are random. It appears to be mostly gloss from a few limited sources 
 I never received the order I placed which I had spent $74 on this book.  There was no insurance for the lost book, therefore I was never refunded.  Quite a disappointment 
 whoever wrote this book is the most miss-informed right-wing intolerant stuck up peace of crap that ever lived. Everying that is not christian, he labels as satanism, for instance the peace sign and wiccas. he says that heavy metal is SATANIC and that to me is very offensive. off, course i agree w/ him on certian bands such as RAMMSTIEN, MARALYN MANSON, and ROB ZOMBIE, but labeling such metal acts as IRON MAIDEN and DIO as satanists, is pure sh-t. if he took time to read the lyrics he would find that he is gravely mistaken. He has not researched this, but just labelled everything that he doesnt agree w/ as satanic. HE IS WRONG 
 This books is just a laundry list of completely useless facts. One gets no personal insight into the individual. Note to self, never buy a biography, always read autobiographies. The difference is amazing. A person writing about their own life is infinitely more useful than an outsider writing about his interpretation of that person's life. 
 This book disappoints on so many levels that it is nearly pointless to catalog all of it's faults in brief, but I'll give them a quick try.  Starting with the title, "Mysteries of the Middle Ages"... catchy isn't it, makes you think of DaVinci Code and wonder what those "Cults of Catholic Europe" were up.  Guess what, you'll never find out, not in this book.  What this book is instead is a quirky basic general survey of what historians call "The High Middle Ages" or the "12th Century Renaissance" written by a non-professional historian.  Cahill doesn't discuss any 'Mysteries' whatsoever (that I can remember reading anyway) and instead devotes his attention to giving vaguely humorous depictions of some medieval personalities.  Unfortunately the author suffers from a limited attention span and constantly digresses, and bears a very apparent grudge against most degreed 'professional' historians, and an outright hatred of Republicans and President George Bush that colors every chapter he writes.  Yes, you did not misunderstand... the author regularly interrupts his commentary on some medieval event to make sarcastic comments about a modern US President!  The author does this CONSTANTLY.  Italy good = America (especially Texas) backwards and immoral.  Yawn.  This is not history - this is just social revisionism with a specific political agenda. Avoid this turkey!  I recommend instead any of the books by Charles H. Haskins "The Renaissance of the 12th Century", etc, or other more recent works by C. Warren Hollister or Malcolm Barber. 
 I found this book to be totally biased. Even before DNA the case that Anna Anderson was Anastasia was extremely weak. In the Dalldorf Asylum Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden said that she was neither Tatiana nor Anastasia. This is a big clue. She never said she was Anastasia. The idea that she was a member of the Imperial Family was placed in her head by a fellow patient at Dalldorf, Clara Peuthert.  Anderson met her Aunt Princess Irene of Prussia under an assumed name. Neither recognized the other. Also Grand Duchess Olga did not recognize Anderson. Olga Alexandrovna would never be so callous as to reject her niece. Pierre Gilliard also said that she could not be Anastasia. Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone once shared a bath with Anastasia and said that the claimant wasn't Anastasia.  Anderson disappeared on 12 August 1922 and reappeared on 15 August 1922. These were the same days on which Franziska Schanzkowska reappeared.   Anastasia knew four languages: Russian, English, French and German. Anna Anderson only knew one: German. She never could speak Russian.  The Author resorts to slander to criticize the claimant's opponents. Lovell claims that a prostitute identified Anna Anderson as Schanzkowska. Where is the proof? Who was the prostitute? No other books refer to a prostitute. Slanderous statements such as this do not belong in print.  The suggestion that Nicholas and Alexandra had a fifth daughter is beneath contempt. This claim destroys Lowell's credibility for good. This claim is an affront to the memory of the Russian Royal family. Not even the most naïve, desperate or gullible conspiracy theorist could fall for this.    The author seems to record everything uttered by Anna Anderson Manahan during her years of senility no matter how outlandish or farfetched.  Substantial sections of the book bear little relation to reality, for example the King Kong rape story. Whilst watching a showing of the King Kong, Manahan leaves the theatre and then confides in Lovell that the entire family except Alexei were raped in front of each other.  The King Kong story is extemely disturbing and despicable, and shows how gullible the author is. It is obvious that Anna Anderson Manahan herself sees how devoted Lovell is towards her and is deliberately making up stories for him.  The author also misidentifies a photo that is really that of Anastasia's sister Marie's ear not Anastasia's ear.   Lovell mocks the claimant's opponents and believes every single word of Anna's. There was nothing regal at all about Anderson's mannerisms or behaviour. There is no balance in this book.   
 Were it possible to give less than one star, I certainly would. The author lost my faith in his introduction when he "debunked" the story of each Pony Express rider being issued a Bible by pointing out that a Bible would be difficult to read while on a galloping horse. Had he put any thought into what he was writing, he might have realized riders were NOT in the saddle 24/7, that there was much "down time" spent at lonely way stations and plenty of time for reading the Bible or the labels on cans of peaches or whatever other material was at hand. When an author writes without thinking, he completely loses my trust. No wonder used copies are selling for eighty cents - overpriced even at that amount 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 Someone once told me that "The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane" is a decent horror movie.  Boy, was she wrong!!  This movie is a snoozer from a horror movie fan's perspective.  I am not talking about the movie's lack of gore either...I don't care about that.  "The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane" is not a horror movie at all and, is quite frankly, dull as a suspense thriller and/or mystery flick.  True, one wonders about the little girl's father and she is eccentric to say the least, but that's not enough to hold the suspense thriller fan's interest.  "The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane" is more of a romance movie with a little bit of mystery and is all about an eccentric weird girl who wants to be able to live alone, her way and without any interference from anyone.  That being said, I do not think there is enough here for a suspense thriller much less a horror movie.  True, Jodie Foster is a good actress, but she looks like a freak with her hairdo in this movie.  It is truly sad that you will find "The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane" in the horror section of video/dvd stores.  No matter what your pleasure is, this movie fails to deliver the goods.  The problem with this movie is that it is simply boring, and not enough action takes place in this movie.  The only viewers that will find this movie to be exceptional are the die-hard Jodie Foster fans.  While I appreciate good acting, there still has to be a compelling enough script to hold one's interest.  I would argue that you do not have this in "Little Girl".  To be perfectly frank, this movie should be called "The Boring Adventures of The Weird Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane and Her Idiot Dorky Little Magician Friend"...that about sums it up 
 Much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. Sadly, from reading some of the reviews on Amazon, Mr. Hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of Florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit Florida after reading Mr. Hiaasen's books. This is sad- that  people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like Twilly Spree, Clinton Skink Tyree and Palmer Stoat. Where does he get these names? During my 25 years in Florida, the people I met  had names like Robert, Jim, Mary, Chris, Michael, etc. By the way, for those of you who think I am just a Floridian with sour grapes- I have been a proud resident of the Northeast for over 20 years. I just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. It causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. Read some Christopher Moore for your humor fix. He doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun 
 You sent me the wrong book, you sent me Violent Voices instead.  
 Plot falls together nicely, but one can easily figure the culprit with a little concentration.  If one can get over the musical theme which is played incessantly over and over and over... one might be inclined to rate the film higher.  I couldn't and won't.   
 This is one of the most confusing books I've encountered on any subject. Having read other comprehensive histories which did a far better job in tying everything together I was utterly disappointed at how haphazard and devoid of substance this one was. After finishing this fairly hefty book, I still have no idea why the Allies won. Judging by his description of events, throughout 1917 and the first half of 1918 the Allies were nowhere close to winning. The Germans had brought Russia to its' knees and could now commit all of their resources against the Western Allies. All of a sudden in 1918 a big turnaround happened and Mr Gilbert gives no clue or idea on how this came about. Even if the author's intent had been mere narrative without analysis, his account of events is so muddled that every few pages it felt like starting a completely different book. His constant emphasis on poetry from the period was pretentious, annoying, and irrelevant.   The two things I did learn from this book were that WWI was even more complex than I had originally thought, and that I need to find a better book about WWI. 
 There are a number of wonderful photographs included in this book, but I think that the author at times dares to presume dialogue and events which may be less than accurate than eye witnessed accounts. It's not quite trash, but then again, it is not quite THE biography of Mr. Kennedy 
 Fred Barnes used to be a smart man -- rather conservative for my tastes, but not unintelligent.  But this book is nothing more than hagiography -- it reminds of Henri Barbusse's book on Stalin, which informed guillible readers that the Leader sometimes went down to help unload the docks when nobody was looking.   The book is shockingly one-sided -- Baby Bush can do no wrong.   It's been a long time since a semi-respected author has glorified a war criminal so passionately.  
 If you're looking for a "what's new in SQL Server 2005" this book covers that.  If you're looking for a reference book on the product, that goes into how to configure or upgrade from an earlier version--Keep Looking.  The book explains new features in some detail.  But, I want to know how to place the databases in a specific directory, how to set up replication--not mirroring; and how to install the software remotely.  The book does not discuss any of that 
 This book is obviously not for the average reader. I read it for a psychological anthropology book review and found myself regretting every moment of it. First of all, Linde tries to give to many examples and  restates the same thing over and over. When I finished chapter 8 and read  the conclusion which was four pages I was a little upset. The whole book  was a waste of time, by just reading the conclusion the few points that  were made are clearly stated there without the non-sense and all the  repetition. INSOMNIACS this is a must buy for you it put me to sleep about  7-8 times. Besides that avoid this book if at all possible. You can thank  me for the sacrafice I made for you 
 Admittedly, this book is now a little dated, but I just came across it at a friend's home and thought that I'd read it.  There is many items worth looking at, but overall the information is available in other books and easier to find 
 i am a huge dre fan but this didn't do it. tracks 3 and 12 are pretty good but other than that i didn't enjoy it. peep some of his other albums though 
 Many of the claims of this book have been proven false or misleading. Please don't this book. Please don't give this person any of your money. The new book by Peter Goodman is the actual truth. I would suggest that instead 
 "I decry supernaturalism in all its forms," writes Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion. "I am attacking God, all gods, anything and everything supernatural, wherever and whenever they have been or will be invented" (p. 36).   On closer inspection it becomes clear that insanely Dawkins is attacking life in all its forms, including his own life, and believes that life is an invention. Dawkins is too deluded or irrational to comprehend that God is everlasting life, and that we are the reproductions of that everlasting common ancestor. See Psalm 82: "I said, `You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High.'"   So if we are gods - i.e., the sons of the cosmic system's creator -, then Richard Dawkins is one of the gods. Because he's attacking "all gods," most irrationally he's attacking himself as well.   The main point I want to make is that the Most High's identity doesn't remain unidentified in the Bible. In John 10:30 Christ identifies himself with the existing highest form of life, i.e. with the parent seed of the universe: "I and the Father are one." On top of that in Revelation 22:13 Christ discloses: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."   Christ is "the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end," because he constitutes the cosmic system's input and output, or everlasting genotype of the phenotype universe.   Thus in essence Christ is teaching that he is the embodiment of the existing highest form of life, and he created the universe for the production of human beings in his own image, similarly as a seed creates a mighty tree for the production of seeds in its own image.   When Dawkins asks, "But how does life get started?", he's asking a stupid question that has only an equally stupid answer, which he doesn't fail to provide: "... we can make the point that, however improbable the origin of life might be, we know it happened on Earth because we are here (p. 137). It is beyond his comprehension that what is everlasting needs no origin, and because life is everlasting, it needs no origin.   Pitifully this Oxford biology professor seems to be ignorant of the principle of biogenesis. In the publication of his own university - i.e. in the Oxford Dictionary of Biology (4th ed., Oxford University Press, 2000) - we find: "biogenesis The principle that a living organism can only arise from other living organisms similar to itself (i.e. that like gives rise to like) and can never originate from nonliving material."   Read also what the Science and Technology Encyclopedia (University of Chicago Press, 1999) says about the subject of biogenesis: "Biological principle maintaining that all living organisms derive from parent(s) generally similar to themselves. This long-held principle was originally established in opposition to the idea of SPONTANEOUS GENERATION of life. On the whole, it still holds good, despite variations in individuals caused by mutations, hybridization, and other genetic effects."   Let me add that no biological generalization is more strongly supported by thoroughly tested evidences than the principle of biogenesis. And because the scientific evidence is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that life can never originate from nonlife, only from life similar to itself, it is an entirely reasonable and consequently scientific conclusion that there was never a time when life did not exist, and human life could come only from human life similar to itself. From this it also follows that the myth of life's origin from nonlife, moreover the myth of man's descent from lower forms of life, should finally be abandoned, at least in scientific circles.   Ironically many evolutionists, and even theologians, are in the habit of assuring us that the accounts of creation in the Bible are not fact-based, but faith-based. However it is beyond any doubt that this is a misconception. Even Philip, Christ's disciple, demanded tangible evidence for the creator's existence. Christ, without hesitation, presented the Father's body for Philip's examination. In John 14:8-9 we find this exchange of words: Philip said to Jesus, "Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied." Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father; how can you say, `Show us the Father'?"  Paul in his letter to the Colossians also assures us that Christ is the creator of the universe, and not something what is intangible or empirically not verifiable: "By Him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible ...; all things were created by Him and for Him. He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together."  Logically Christ, being the generative seed of the universe, is everlasting. The universe has no power whatsoever to act upon the initial cause of its own origin, just as a tree has no power to act upon its own parent seed.  At this point the argument may be raised that man is not the cosmic system's input and output, or pinnacle of all life forms in the universe. Indeed, whether it is true or not, we can't be absolutely certain. Precisely for this reason the theory of creation is tentative, just as scientific theories are supposed to be.   In any case just because we are not absolutely certain that man constitutes the existing highest form of life does not mean that the theory of creation is not fact-based, but faith-based. Man's existence is an undeniable fact. What is faith-based is the speculation that a life form superior to human life exists, which superhuman being is reproductively isolated from human life. But if either evolutionists or fundamentalists keep insisting - in the total absence of evidence - that human life is not the pinnacle of life forms in the universe, in that case they are the ones who believe in the existence of superhuman beings.  As a matter of fact Christ never told us that anything superior to his own being exists. He only affirmed his own existence and his identity with the Father, but never the existence of a being beyond and above himself. Being the Creator of the universe, he is most qualified to know that no being superior to himself ever existed.  In the final analysis this is my recommendation: Buy The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins, provided you need expensive and substandard toilet paper.  
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 The author seems to be trying to justify some interlink between this  philosophy and his own.  This is not the straight forward translation I  expected 
 This book gives plenty of background into international finance.  Unfortunately, it has some big flaws, in my opinion.  First, there are not enough calculation examples.  Second, there are too few questions at the end of each chapter.  In addition, you must go to the author's website for the solution.  Once you get there, you will be surprised to find out that the author has only solved maybe two out of eight problems.  That's annoying.  I do not recommend this book.  Take a class from another professor who uses a different text book 
 Have used many types of dvd-r. This the only one I have found that didn't have a record speed encoded in it and was unusable. Tried different locations on the spindle and the same results. Would have been a good buy if they worked. Gave it only one star because there was no 1/2 star 
 This book is good if you want to be warned over and over to wash your hands! If you are looking for the difference between viruses and bacteria, actual scientific references or interesting facts about how germs and bacteria live, reproduce and colonize us - look elsewhere. This book was too preachy and didn't have enough information for anyone with a genuine interest in biology, human physiology, or health. 
 I can't imagine why Mr. Andriessen's new opera Writing to Vermeer is garnering so much praise -- maybe "you had to be there." On CD, however, it's a grating, annoying, and self-consciously postmodern trial to endure... in fact, I finally had to just give up about halfway through the second disc. Life is too short, after all. 
 Manufacturer would be better off providing extra legs, as this device is very fragile.  Not a good consumer product 
 First, I would like to make clear, or to put it more aptly, this book was written by an academic and not someone who is in the actual business. In other words, lots of theory but nothing practical to back it up. If I'm not mistaken, the author has never, ever actually written a screenplay and have it produced. Those are strikes one and two against this book. Strike three is that, yes there is some valuable information contained between the covers but it's SO disjointed, you have to constantly go back and forth throughout it in order to try to make any sense out it. My advice? Buy something written by people who ARE in the movie business and NOT from the "Joe College" types who live off of tenure so they really don't have to prove anything to anyone. It's one thing to talk about writing and quite another to sell something for a six figure amount to a production company 
 Did not stick to tile. Sucktions were big but it just sit in the corner 
 Anyone who listens to that Harvard nut-job is a sap. This book is alright, not as good as Gilbert's, though. The way to go is to pick ONE book that makes sense to you and study it well.  Harvey's "forest and trees" theory begs the question: If he falls down in a forest and there is no one there to hear his cries for help, will anyone care 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 I used the splitter to send the signil of the dvd player and satilite box to the big screen tv. Forgot to turn off the dvd player off and the next day I could not use the splitter on side that the dvd player was on 
 I felt the product gave me too much of a buzz including causing difficulty concetrating and made me short tempered.  It also increased heart rate.  I won't use it. It might be OK for others but if you try it please start with only one capsule for a few days and see how you feel.  If you have any heart problems, STAY AWAY 
 In both performances, the mix has rendered John Entwistle's bass inaudible.  It sucks.  The only place you can hear it is during the solos in Underture from Tommy and 5:15 from Quadrophenia.  I saw the live performances and the bass cuts through like a 747 going overhead.  It doesn't on the DVD.  Infact, you wouldn't even know Entwistle's there.  R.I.P., John 
 Dr Laura gives some good advice but it is mixed with absolutely stupid advice such as when she says that a person should stay in an unhappy marriage because of their commitment.  It is unfortunate that she chose to use this relationship book as her soapbox to promote her own religous beliefs. If you dont believe in God and as Dr Laura, you can never be happy is the moral of her story. Laura makes a number of irresponsbile and misleading statements such as calling daycare, modern child abandonment. She talks about chastity until marriage several times and about 'shacking up' to use her term but never once does she explain why monogomy is important in a healthy relationship and she absolutely never mentions that a relationship has a natural progression part of which is physical. She moves the step of marriage up to be much sooner than it should be in a relationship while at the same time saying people should wait 'through the 4 seasons' or a year before being married. Actually says 'it is dangerous to pursue a physical relationship without the promise of marriage'. Is she saying men should promise marriage before they are ready?  She would have produced a much better book if she had given more examples of callers to her radio show or letters and given less malformed advice. Her rants and raves are actually entertaining, too bad that along with examples were cut short with her religious promotions and poorly thought advice snippets.  I listened to the whole thing(audio book cd) and I couldnt list the 10 stupid things implied in the title. I guess they are there and maybe under chapters 1-10 in the book. I could call out several stupid things but I didnt see 10 that stood out. Lots of it was common sense and phsychologically off callers made it obvious.  It is fun to listen to but make sure it is not the only book you use as a source. There are other better sources for relationship info. 
 This Audio CD was produced in very poor quailty, in terms of the sound and by the person reading it.  It would be nice if it was the true voice of Wallace Wattles - because I'd keep it just for sentimental reasons, but it sounds like it was recorded in about 1970 in a closet with a $50 tape recorder.  The reader is not professional - being short to of breath to speak whole sentences, and they are very monotone without expression (and I love this book so much, I want to hear it with some amount of conviction, strength and joy!)  If you want a better audio version than this - simply record yourself 
 Instead of reading this book I recommend that you be yourself, make use of kindness, and think of others.  Lowndes comes across with good intentions, but her innate social climbing and manipulating tactics are a turn off.  If I had to sum up this book in one word it would be, sad.       
 The one thing Paul McCartney really needs to stop doing is becoming concerned over his place in history.. he's already in the books... he doesn't need to prove anything to anyone.. and he's got to realize that John Lennon has gotten the recognition he deserves because he was a fantastic artist R.I.P., and....he was killed! Any rock star who's died of a sudden death.. be it drugs, or violence, usually becomes a legend.. (John Bonham, Nick Drake, Morrison, Joplin, Hendrix, Cobain, and Lennon.. hip-hop artists like Biggie, and Tupac.) If you've read a bunch about the Beatles.. you'll find out that Paul really did keep the Beatles together in their formitive years.. and that Paul's wimsical, theatrical ideas really were the Beatle's primary influence during their later years.. but this primary influence had the most profound affect on John Lennon who stretched the Beatles the most in terms of pure eclectisism. Paul's got to keep living.. producing and making music.. and just enjoy his privileged life.. I'm probably the biggesst Macca fan out there but he's just got to get over this!! 
 This book has some insights, but overall I think it is lacking in a lot of areas.  The book seemed like the strange child of a Freudian and mainline evangelical.  The book spends a lot of time concentrating on what happened when we were little boys and how that still effects us today.  It makes some sense, but the five-year-old approach to things is very one-dimensional.  Furthermore, it didn't make a terribly convincing case because Eldridge didn't seem to do any research beyond the experiences of him and his peers.  As far as "connecting with a Man's soul" there's quite a bit there that I thought was good and should be considered (such as the need for danger/adventure) but still, it felt like Eldridge was writing off the top of his head.  For all of his pop-psychology, nothing was supported or informed by discipline -as if we should just take his word for it and ignore anyone else who has thought of this subject.  When he quoted the Bible, it was as if he was just proving a pre-conceived point.  His interpretation was very mediocre.  Eldridge's book has some interesting points to look at, but I've read better on the same subject.  It was like being given a cupcake when I wanted steak.  It was like mining for gold with a garden shovel.  For some people, it might be like a band-aid when they really need a tourniquet. 
 I picked this book up in the hopes of reading another great story from Phillip K. Dick, but it was really disappointing.  My previous favorites from him have been "The Man in the High Castle" and "Through a Scanner Darkly".  This book has plot elements, but it's really not well put together or entertaining.  The main characters aren't very interesting, and the love & rejection the protagonist gets from Pris is so strange, it's almost like Dick is forcing something that had happened to him into the story.  Really, would not recommend this book to anyone 
 I usually love her work, but this book never took off and the two main characters were highly annoying.  Just eh... 
 Embraced By The Light by Betty J. Eadie is actually a pretty good book, well written, and probably well-researched from other people's NDE's.  This book is filled with some great stuff, but also some not so great stuff.  Eventually, no matter how open your mind is, it becomes clearer and clearer that some of these things are either made up or a rip-off from other NDE accounts.  The author seems sincere and it is a heartfelt account.  I could actually feel myself in her shoes in each page of the book, and empathize with her.  The book is heart-wrenching at times and I actually sobbed.  Not so much in sorrow, but a sadness mixed with joy.  The book is very bittersweet but filled with hope, and it provides an invaluable message...  That the most important thing in life is to enjoy life and to love each other.  Now what I just wrote would make the book worth 5 stars.  However, this is where the scale tips backwards.  The book is biased.  She goes on to say that while she was in "heaven" in her NDE, she realized that the creator of the Universe and all else is Jesus Christ himself.  Of course the description of Jesus is the typical white man with a beard with a light glowing from within his beard.  That's all fine and good.  BUT, Mrs. Eadie forgets to say that the creator of the Universe presented itself to HER as Jesus Christ.  This is not a Universal Truth, it is the author's truth.   Eadie makes a good point that while in "heaven," she learned that it is foolish to criticize other people's religious beliefs, or lack of...  Then she ruins this promising statement by indicating that Christianity is at the top rung and that all other religions don't hold the same love and promises as the gospel.  To a Christian or Mormon, this would make sense, but the TRUTH is that all religions or lack of them are EQUAL.  Christianity is no better than Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Wicca, Paganism, Tao, or any others.  To think that one is better, more true, or superior to another (even if the bible says so), is just plain ignorance.  The bias on the importance of men is another downfall for the book, going back to women being weaker in nature than men and that it was "Eve's impatience" or whatever in the "garden of eden" (a biblical fable no more true than the myth of Pandora's Box) that brought death into the world.   Men and women are EQUAL, period.  This book also slams the concept of reincarnation.  Reincarnation can't quite be scientifically proven, but it is on the brink.  Shame on you Mrs. Eadie.  But if that's her perspective and what she thought she learned in "heaven," than she is entitled to her "conclusion."  Remember folks...  There can be as many similarities in many individual's Near-Death Experiences as there are differences.  Something that is important to know is that Jesus or Jehovah or Angels are not any more true, real, living, or righteous than Pan, Dionysus, Horus, Osiris, Isis, Demeter, Diana, Hecate, Buddha, Shiva, Krishna, etc, for representations of the Creator.  People need to decide for themselves which form of God or Goddess (YES, GOD COULD BE FEMALE, it's not impossible, no matter what the bible, the kuran, or the book or mormon says) to believe in and/or worship.  Overall, this is a decent book, despite its faults and biases.  To a Christian, Mormon, and/or a New Ager, who is dealing with death and dying, or has someone close to you who is, I highly recommend this book to you.  Even to non-Christians, this isn't an entirely bad read, but there are much better accounts for non-Christians and all are just as valid as Mrs. Eadie's.  Remember, the most important thing in life is to enjoy it and to love one another.  
 I first encountered the words of Wayne Dyer 5 or so years ago on PBS. I liked what I heard. Though nothing he says is original, I did like the way he presented it.  The first book of his I read was "There's A Spiritual Solution to Every Problem", the book on which the first lecture I watch on PBS was based.  I was inspired by, and enjoyed that book. As I did the next two or three. But recently, and especially with this latest volume, he simply repackages his older books in a different form. Ironic for a book about inspiration.  I want to be clear that I have no intrinsic problem with some of the concepts he talks about. But this book, and his lectures, and overall attitude lately, as opposed to my first exposure to him, are becoming quite the turn off.  In this volume, there were somevery glaring examples of either contradiction, strict unfairness, and at times, ego...despite Dyer's commitment against the ego.  I also found it very repetative, but I realize he warns of that early on. However just because something is acknowledged, does not mean it should be accepted.  The following items bothered me the most, and I would be interested to learn if others readers agree with these bothersome items.  -The oft mentioned assumption that he is personally the reincarnated spirit of St. Francis of Asissi.  -He is not very supportive of his friends. To him it seems that to even be in the presence of an unhappy person insults him. His reason being that since life is perfect and nothing wrong EVER happens to us, being unhappy or scared of something is simply a low energy, and one thathe is unwilling to stand inthe presence of. He even mentions a story of a good friend of his who started to be worried about the leaness of his business. He had legitimate concerns about going under. Not thoughts of evil or suicide or anything, just some natural worry when the finances did not look good.  Dyer, in the book, tells us "just about the time I was no longer willing to be exposed to this sort of thing..." Meaning that in his perfect life, there are no accidents, and so, he did not want to be around his supposed friend, because being a little scared or worried is ungodlike. He ignores the fact that in order to help people, especially friends, you have to be in the midst of bad things sometimes. He often quotes Mother Teresa. Yet if shehad told all of those sick people to simply "think about what you were doing when you first became sick, and stop doing it!" she would not bethe saintwe recognize her as today.  -Secondly, multiple times in just about every chapter, he plugged one or more of his other books, books by colleagues, or books published by Hay House. It is allright to acknowledge your previous works, or those of others, but the frequency with which he does so in thisvolume is disingenuous at best. Product placement, at worst.  -I call one's attention to page 106 of the book. Dyer's "12 Step Program to Simplicity." Items 10 and 11.  Item 10 calls for us to "Eschew Debt" and to live within our means...not purchases or buying things we do not absolutley need, in order to live the life we agreed with God to havebefore we were born.  The very next item, number 11, instructs us to "forget about cash value." He proceeds, on the very same page, to tell us that we should not look at the dollar signs when we are "inspired" to do something like take a trip, eat a nice dinner out on the town, or be comfortable. How can one eschew debt, and yet ignore the dollar value of an item they are inspired to posess?  -Pages 110-113. The Ram Dass Story. This is among the more insulting parts of the book. He tells the story of one ofhis mentors, and reproduces a letter he has posted on his (Dyer) own website. In it, Dyer tells of how gentle and wonderful Dass hasbeen, and how important this "dear friend" has been throughouthis life, especially since coming to live in Maui in the twilight of his life.  Then, Dyer has the audacity to solicit you and I for money to help buy Dass his own house! In Maui!  This book "eschewing" the ideaof possesions, money, and doubting that the universe will take care of everything you ever could want, is asking us to pay for his mentor's housing conditions, simply because Dyer thinks he is "a wonderful man".  How about this...Dyer isso fond of "giving something of yourself everyday..." how about cutting into your millions of dollars and cutting a check for your hero to own his own house? You can afford it, I cannot. Or if you cannot swallow that, cut him a check large enough to coverhis moving expenses out of Maui (one of the most expensive places on earth to live), and to a location far more affordable. If what is said about Dass is true, he should be happy anywhere he can find to live. They arrogance of a millionaire asking for donations to save his "mentor" who lives just down the street from him was nearly enough to get me to stop reading the book right there.  Furthermore, the entire business bore little relevence to the rest of the chapter, which was ostensibly about "Faith Banishes all doubt".  Unless you can sucker the general public into buying your guru a home in Maui.  -The name dropping throughout the book. He studied with, worked with, talked to, helped the luggage problems of...fill in the blank with celebrity X. The encounter with Renee Zellwegger outlined on pages 144-146 (complete with photo copy of a note she gave him) is the most glaring example of this.   -His mentioning more of the great things he did "in spirit", such as throwing away a mashed up burger he saw on the floor of a McDonald's, page 150 or so. I love how picking up a burger being trampled is heroic, but heneeds ourhelp in paying for his guru's home....      My point is made. There are other things, but honstly, I do not feel like looking for the page number, as I would have to skim the book again.  I am finding Dyer to be more annoying as time goes on. By his own advice about annoying people, I should send himthoughts of love. I would do so, in proportion to how much this book annoyed me, but I also have a day job.   
 This book is just one of those books covering everything, and actually nothing in detail. 
 I'm a new fan to Bob Dylan's music.  Oh Mercy, Another Side of Bob Dylan and Desire is where I started.  After listening to Empire Burlesque I have to think that Bob somehow was blindsided by the 80's.  Every cheesey production trick to come out of the 80's is on this album (reverb, background singers, glossed up production).  So it's kind of a hard listen.  You get through all that crap to get to the songs which aren't Bob's best (in my humble opinion).  My suggestion is to stop wasting you time and move on to Bob's 90's music which is far superior to his 80's music.  His 90's music is good but not as good as his 70's music.  However, his 60's music is probably close to scripture at this point in a lot of peoples minds.  Enter this record at your own risk.  At the end of it you might be searching for spandex pants.  Maybe Bob could re-record this album and free the songs of the bad production?  That's a thought...  
 Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have no problem with reading books in the second person narrative.  However, Keith is borrowing styles too heavily from books like American Psycho, i.e. constant naming of products and Brand names.  The Buddhist element to the story is like a side-note, and when it is discussed between the characters, it's as if Keith felt his readers were ignorant and he'd have to spell it all out, which makes for a condescending and annoying read.  If non-Buddhists are interested in the subject you are writing about, they can investigate for themselves the meaning of Buddhist words and concepts.  Don't underestimate your readers and don't hold their hand throughout the story 
 I am currently taking a grad school course of Sports Ethics and we are using this book as a text.  Coakley begins each chapter well using differnt socialogcal schools of thought as a basis for defining the each issue that is presented chapter by chapter.  However, the second half of each chapter turns into his own personal treatise on what is wrong with sports in today's society.  Although I do commend Coakley on having the guts to let his view be known, I don't feel for a book that is used as a text he presents the argument equally well on each subject 
 If you are a real hard core Sonny Chiba Collector, then this is not worth your time, because he doesn't do really anything in this flick! Why is it not in widescreen? Why is there no original language track? This is DVD right? If you still want this movie to fill the gap in your Chiba collection try to find it in its original format & quality 
 I picked this book up because I saw the author interviewed on the Daily Show. Oops. I'm going to have to lower my trust in Jon Stewart a notch. One useful piece of advice I've received is not to be afraid to cut bait on a book that you don't really like. So after about 150 pages, I calling it quits with this one.  This book is supposed to recount the author's experience of growing up with a father in the CIA but it reads like a history lecture--and a dull one at that. I'm not sure why Richardson writes as though he's trying to distance himself from the narrative as much as possible. I'm not sure why anyone outside of his immediate family or friends would be interested in this book: the personal narrative lacks warmth and emotion and the anecdotes only hint at the gripping spy stories a lifetime of Tom Clancy has prepared me for 
 Considering the hype, I really expected more.  ** The interview is only half the book, and the type is HUGE -- despite being a trade paperback, there are only about 80% as many words per page as with your average mass market paperback.   ** The interview was unedited, so a non-trivial portion of it consists of, e.g., Heinlein saying "What was that?  How do you spell that?" and then Schulman spelling it out.   ** The interview itself is about what you would expect from a 20-year-old with a political axe to grind. ** The rest of the book is filler, e.g., letters that Schulman wrote Heinlein, Schulman's reviews of some of Heinlein's books, etc.. ** All of the above are spiced with the expected libertarian rantings and hyperbole, e.g., Schulman's claim that anyone who thinks Heinlein was a Fascist is a Marxist. (Heinlein was NOT a fascist, but AT BEST such rejoinders show the same lack of intellectual depth and integrity displayed by some of Heinlein's critics.) In short, this is a short, expensive book that is more about Schulman than it is about Heinlein.  [... 
 This book is mostly built around the idea "I wish it were true = it *is* true".  While this book has innate appeal to those looking for meaning in their lives, if you're looking for a firm foundation for understanding coincidences in your life (i.e. intellectual integrity), you'd be better off buying an introduction to probability 
 What is this novel, The Marble Faun, that so many have said they "just simply must read" before travelling to the continent?  There seems to be some confusion about it, not only in my mind, but in the minds of others as well.  I know, at least that the publishers have had their questions.  Why else would they be unable to agree on a title?  Even though they may have agreed to publish the book, the British publishers spoke their mind at least and changed the author's title to Transformations.  After publication I'm sure they had wished that they had changed more than that.  It seems that the publishers also had to search for a selling point for the novel.  The prose alone could not carry sales, so they have added photographs and made it "the great travel book of our age".  Of course, I dare say people are buying the book more for the pictures than for the story itself.  The anticipation of seeing the piazza where Hilda's tower stands has intrigued the reader more than the murder, and the characters' subsequent transformations and loss of innocence ever could.   The story itself, centering around the actions of the four characters seems long and confused.  The characters float between scenes acting as they would anywhere else; the changing backdrops seem to act only as a way of keeping the travelling reader's attention.  Although Hawthorne makes sure you see that the four characters do in fact change (in such chapters as "The Faun's Transformation"), the characters seem to be simply caricatures, over-exaggerated looks at one type of person.  This is also accentuated by Hawthorne's use of epithets - such as "The Sculptor", "The Dove," and "The Faun".  Because of this the book has the air of being a presentation of four friends' romp through Italy, rather than being the intricate tale of four characters' lives and relationships.  One may wonder why Hawthorne chose to publish the Marble Faun in one volume rather than serially, as is common for his contemporaries.  The answer to me seems clear.  If a reader were to ever put this book down, he would not have the heart to pick it up again 
  should of written these years ago. They are wack, plain and simple. If it's on MTV or VH1, you know it's commercial. They can't rap, they are just another of the Down south's ABC rappers.  
 I'm sorry, but I expect more out of a book. Beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric. After reading beautiful books such as Cold Mountain and Brideshead Revisited, to mention just two, I found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that I knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that wouldn't be worth the read. At page four I was fed up with the author's style and slammed the book shut 
 I love Gwen Stefani and No Doubt, adn I figured, to tide me over until the Sweet Escape, I'd get one of ND's older CDs since I have all of them Tragic Kingdom and on. It was between their debut and this. since Beacon Street got rave reviews, i bought it over the self-titled one.. When i popped it into my stereo, it was only alright. Some tracks were ok, but some made me feel nauseated and I could only listen to it for the first 5 seconds. *cough* blue in the face *cough* The only songs that I liked were By The Way and Doghouse was ok. I lovvveee by the way though. Overall its worth two stars for me. [I love the inside of the disc all the pics are so cool. I also like the disc with all the little band members!]  A 
 This book should have been about 100 pages.  The author gives thanks for having tapes of the '96 season games made available to him and unfortunately he shares those games in minute detail.  There are some Yankee tidbits here but for a better written, more informative, and yes, more painful book try Buster Olney's "Last Night... 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 The theme of this novel I believe is something around equality or injustice. But the author poorly displays the emotions and feelings, but the storyline about a poor painter who commits crimes weakens its affect. The life of a painter has little to do with injustice, and being deprived of splashing ink onto a canvas isn't a powerful topic, nor injustice in large quantities. If the story were something of higher stakes, the message would have been brought better. The works of Dalasquez have been forgotten in the snap of a finger. As stated before, the irrelavent topic of art is constantly replaced. Art is a fad, and I, Juan De Pareja is the tale of a painter being deprived of being part of a fad. If the author wants a tale of injustice involving fads, he could just capture the diary of a teenager 
  This disappointed me..., March 21, 2006 Reviewer: Thom (Polk County, Florida) - See all my reviews  If this film centered on the actual slaves, rather than the ACTORS making narration, it would have been a very powerful documentary. While reading it should have focused on the drawings, and dipictions. When I saw a great deal of the YOUNG actors on a chair reciting prose-to me it seemed more to accentuate the actors rather than what the text was saying.   Just the fact that slavery existed under the United States Constitution shows how law can be manipulated in any way those in power want it to be and the goverment can do whatever they want and get away with it. Remember it was legal only 200 years ago, and suppression and rediculous repression of human beings based on race existed even in the 1970's. And it was legal back then.  Based on the horrible adverse treatment of slaves, it showed the majority of southern businessmen were very POOR businessmen. THink about it--they spent HUGE--and I mean HUGE quantities--of money ($800 or $1000 was a vast fortune back in the 1800's) only to beat and starve and work them to death like, they are not protecting their investments. You would think common sense dictates if one spent vast fortunes, they would want to CARE for their investment (feed them, clothe them adequately, gave them proper shelter, etc). No, these businessmen starved and tortured their investments. I guess they had money to throw away. This lack of business sense probably is a reason why the south lost.   The slave trade was a big business back then. Huge quantities of slaves were NOT captured in Africa, but were sold to the white slave traders by their own people. And yes Africans kept slaves too--blacks enslaved blacks.   Interesting to note even Abraham Lincoln cared less about the existance of slavery but wrote the Emancipation Proclamation only as a political ploy to not get European nations involved, and that the Civil war was, in reality, only to keep the north and south united and not form a separate government.   Back to the documentary-yes it disappointed me. I didn't know what showing the actors sitting and reciting proved. The actor's faces should not have been shown at all. It distracted from the real theme of memories of slavery. These actors should have been faceless and not seen. Unless they wanted to play dipictions rather than just SIT and READ.    
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 The book presents a unique opportunity for readers to experience many of the same things that are offered in the Star Series "Excellence in Performance", if they don't have the opportunity to participate in the series.    The book is an alternative source of information that is available to interested participants/individuals who want to experience and support being a part of the inner circle philosophy.  Taking and changing the stereotype of the secretary from someone that just answered the telephone(s) and "kept secrets", into basically a working functioning partner for the individuals they are assisting.  The book described several categories from learning how to communicate better and making decisions, to having enough savvy and intelligence information to allow your leader to spend time on other critical projects that require their time. 
 Just a heads-up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides. You will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them. Given the verbiage on the box, it caught me as enough of a surprise that I returned the scanner. I'm not OK with deception like that 
 Three things make me better than Sean Hannity: 1) I was actually in the US Military 2) I graduated college, unlike Sean 3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America. Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans. Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion 
 I don't even know where to start.   If she wasn't so (as we are constantly reminded) well-educated and well travelled I would assume that the author just didn't know how to be a gracious guest. Instead of relishing this rare hospitality (Amish families very rarely invite Englisch guests to stay with them) she repeatedly criticizes her first host family (the wife isn't fit enough, the food isn't healthy enough, her room isn't big enough.) Then when a second family allows her to stay with them she thinks that being their guest for two weeks means she has a right to belittle their plans to expand their homestead to included a much needed birthing center for the community. And to top it all off, when she gets home, she's too special to share her experiences with regular people, and now thinks the people who were previously her social peers are like "sharks."  This book is not worth your time. There are several excellent books that include far more insight into the lives of the Amish and far less over-intellectualized, self-centered, whining and condescension. See "Driving the Amish" by Jim Butterfield 
 The Stephen Mitchell version of the Tao Te Ching will please the philosophical bent and Weltanschauung of certain modern and post-modern readers. On points it is extremely Spinozan. To recognize that many readers will like it, perhaps like it a great deal, is not to suggest that it is an 'authentic' translation, because it is not. To Mitchell's credit, he acknowledges this (after a fashion, at least). He thinks he is relating what Lao Tzu really meant to say to 20th century readers. Certain 21st century western readers may agree with Mitchell, but I expect that most scholars will not.  The prospective reader should be aware that this is the Way of Stephen Mitchell, which, at least on some points, is not the Way of the "ancient masters." I strongly suggest that this NOT be the first or the only 'version' of the Tao Te Ching that you read. In fact, [assuming that you prefer not to be misled] I suggest that you don't read it at all. The [authentic] Tao Te Ching is a fascinating text, counter-intuitive and challenging, worthy of our contemplation and puzzlement thousands of years after its writing. This volume isn't. 
 I picked this book up in the library expecting because it seemed to have similar elements to a book I am writing. Hopefully my book won't come out this way. Cambell spends far too much time showing us the inner workings of a family we don't particularly care about and not enough time building our interest in what is in the woods. I didn't even stick around to find out. 
 pros nice look great setup on keys multiple keypress works comfortable slim con Very Long keyboard it misses typed characters about 25% of the time, backspace is slow,  I have about 70% accuracy with this keyboard 
 Usually, when I purchase music, I'll tape off my favorite 4 or 5 cuts and forget about the rest of the songs. Not so on this album...there's not a cull in the bunch. The musicians in this band are such that even if you don't like bluegrass, after listening to these boys pick, you will at the very least have to admire their musicianship. I happen to play myself, and I'm pretty much a traditionalist, but there's enough of hard-drivin', down-home 'grass on this one to please anyone. If you're thinking of buying this one, in my opinion, you can't go wrong. Try it...you'll like it 
 I have to dock this guide 2 stars just for its assertion that those who do the dancing, do the prancing.  In other words, if you can't dance, or don't enjoy dancing, forget the whole thing?! Claustrophobic cultural elitism.  (I didn't notice anything similar in the companion volume, "How to Meet the Right Man").  Docked one other star for being too mainstream. Other than these two bridge-outs, there's much good advice that mainly would assist those sincerely looking for bonafide relationships, but I feel it still isn't really aimed at everybody.   
 This book is near useless!  Don't let the title fool you this book has near nothing to do with Graham's views on value investing.  It is an extremly boring book on Ben's life, one which makes me have little or no respect for Ben as a person.  I made the mistake of choosing this book hoping to pick up some tips and save a few bucks on the cover price, instead of buying the sure things (Intelligent Investor or Security Anaylsis).  Those looking to be a value investor, this is one where there is little "value" in my opinion, and money would better be served somewhere else 
 Slim Jims may taste ok but that's because they are so greasy. That's what helps the flavor. I can't figure out why anyone would like these as I can't seem to chew them to a point where I feel comfortable to swallow. It's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat.  The amount of fat, cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky. I'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff. At least I can chew the beef jerky 
 Tony Morrison is an excellent writer. I simply anticipated more out of her before reading this book. Maybe it is my problem as a white male, but I expected more raw emotion from her characters or better insight on the people she wrote about, or, alas the plight of the African-American woman. Maybe that was the point of the book to show that all of these human emotions have been locked up due to terrible circumstance and treatment 
 Do NOT do like I did and buy this book strictly by what the synopsis says about it! I love hot and spicy food, and I thought this would make a great addition to my cookbook collection. Unfortunately, almost all of the  recipes are unusual and difficult, and certainly not even close to being  what "common" cooks would like. I guess if you were having a  fancy-schamcy "hot and spicy" dinner party, and had a chef to  prepare the recipes, the book would be okay. Otherwise, don't waste your  money on it 
 Root shock was an okay of a book. It was very one-side; Fullilove never considered the other point-of-view. She also attempted to capture the reader's attention by supplying the readers with full size pictures that took up an entire page; however, she failed to get our attention. The urban renewal process is interesting, but she took so much credit for supplying the information, when in reality, it was the interviews that supplied the information about the process of urban renewal. The book was okay, but it can be skipped. 
 I bought basically, because I love Denisee Richards and Daryl Hanna, plus I like also Valerie Tasso, besides I am a fan of Pierre Woodman, they all appear on the film, among some well know adult stars like Dora Venter, Rita Faltoyano. But really the film is not good at all, it is slow, the elements don't match. It is sometimes hard to follow. It is really not worth buying it 
 S.T. Joshi concludes in his introduction to Chaosium second volume of the Best Weird Tales of Arthur Machen: "All that one need read of Arthur Machen in the weird vein are contained in these two Chaosium volumes of his tales..." As always Joshi is quite correct, so it begs the question why he found this third volume necessary at all. The stories included here are only a pale shadow of Machen at his best (e.g. The Three Impostors or the fabulous "A Fragment of Life"), and is only interesting for the sake of completeness. Greatly disappointing 
 This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary 
 I rarely purchase a CD without listening to the entire album first.  I've been burned too many times.  I thought I'd take a chance on Snow Patrol, based on the strength of their single, "Chasing Cars".  That was a mistake.    Is it just me, or did every other melody sound exactly like the one before it?  The lyrics were repetitive and mediocre.  I feel that good music should make you feel *something*.  Listening to this, I felt NOTHING.  Well that's not true.  I felt disappointed and annoyed for having wasted my money on this CD.  
 T.E. Lawerence was certainly an extraordinary figure in history based on his achievements with the Arabs during WWI but not all heroes are great writers and Lawrence is NOT a good writer.  Do yourself a favor and get a book on Lawrence of Arabia by a professional history writer or although not exactly historically correct (but close enough) watch the fabulous movie "Lawrence of arabia".  You will still get the true feeling of what it was like back then and what Lawrence was trying to accomplish.  His book will just confuse the reader 
 If you hope to read a strong, precursor character of Anita Blake, this isn't the book to buy. It is a very imaginative tale, but an arid one. The reader does get into the characters' lives, psyches, etc., but the story is not as fresh, lively, or quirky as the Anita Blake or Meredith Gentry series.  
 "The Zahir" started out well, but about 100 pages into the book my interest level dropped.  It, in no way, mentally stimulated me.  I could not read one more page of the main character's self-indulgent and arrogant thoughts and actions.  I guess, if you are the type of person that needs to love the main character in order to read a novel, then this is not your book.  I couldn't stand him and I really hope that the main character isn't a reflection Paul Coelho.  I almost threw this book away, but I instead donated it.  I loved "The Alchemist." 
 I ordered this for my 7 yr old grandaughter for Valentines Day.  Upon receipt it was not operable. The user is supposed to ask the "Love Ball" a question, and then turn it over to see the answer under a clear glass window. The answer would not appear under window it seemed to be covered with a dark liquid 
 I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch 
 I received the Bjc-85 portable printer. I have plugged it into many electrical outletts in my home and office. The item will not turn on . I was sold a broken printer. I am very unhappy with this product 
 This is for beginners, it's filled with useless forms, and it provides very little information beyond a common-sense and reasoned approach to real estate.  Surely there must be better resources than this 
 I love how someone was calling the people who thought that they "werent" the same, stupid. first of all, the person who is the center of this band is named kris, as bright eyes is conor. they have seperate last names as well! would you look at that! yeah, he does sound like conor, you have to be an earless brainless idiot to not see the similarities. dont act like youre above everyone and super obscure by saying they dont sound alike. because they do. and conor has uniquely adopted this style of music which is.. obviously being posed off of. i could see if an angle maybe used his singing style and then chose his words and writing style differently, or even music writing style, but he doesnt, he goes right with copying off of bright eyes, and that's not very creative or commendable, whether or not he is a drunk like conor or not. just because conor drinks doesnt mean he puts on any less of a good show.. here's a question.. ever been to a bright eyes show? oh, obviously not 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one 
 Be careful - this is only the student's solutions manual and NOT the textbook.  
 Not very bright for an LED.  AND, guess what? This is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes! Given the picture shows a spike on it, one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something... well, the spike is more like a thumbtack. I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer, so I don't blame Amazon - but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this. 
 I bought this book because David Sedaris recommended it at the last reading I attended.  The stories are all on the "dark" side and they do not appeal to me.  Admittedly, I prefer something much more light hearted, so others may love this book 
 While the high end Riedel glasses are very nice, this set didn't even come close to my expectations. I thought I was getting a nice entry-level set of high quality glasses I could give as a gift. What I got was an undersized, clunky set of glasses that I could have gotten for $9.99 from Target. A total disappointment 
 I bought this speaker about one year ago from Best Buy, very disappointed.  The sound quality is terrible, I have two presence channel $15 KLH speakers that sound better than this.  No high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic, hence why Bose is not  high end.  After a year of misery on my ears, I've replaced this with a Paradigm center speaker that only cost $20 more, and the difference is not even comparable.  Do not buy this, or any Bose product at all.  Save your money and buy Paradigm, B&W, or similar, most of the time they cost a little bit more, but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers, and you will get your money's worth 
 I was given three months to read this book, and each time I picked it up I threw it down in disgust.  Between the none-stop Johnny Appleseed referances to the Collegian's Guide to Growing Pot, it is amazing I got through it.  I am convinced he was once a Columbian drug lord 
 This was a very disappointing entry in the Doc Ford series. I would like to be more specific, but I read it two months ago (why does Amazon wait so long to solicit reviews?) and have read several dozen other books since then--all of which I have enjoyed much more than I did Dark Light. 
 This was a required textbook for a graduate-level project management class I am taking.  Unfortunately, it is full of mathematical errors (Our professor pointed out 4 errors during one class session alone!). The other major downfall to the book is that it is heavily skewed toward an engineering perspective of project management and does not consider a business approach.  I have had better financial textbooks explain formulas to use when calculating future and present value of cash flows in a more straightforward manner than this book.  If you must buy this book, buy it used and save a few dollars. 
 Lapinski writes that in 1998, he "began spreading the great news about pepper spray with religious zeal." If you're a hiker ooking for an objective analysis on the pros and cons of pepper spray, you won't find it here. If you're a hunter trying to decide whether or not to carry pepper spray in grizzly country, Lapinski's one-sided arguments will turn you off. This book is a shameless ad for pepper spray.  Lapinski begings by telling a story about a time he was hiking in Glacier Park when he spotted a grizzly about 200 yards away. The bear looked his way, then entered an aspen grove. Instead of turning around or going way around the bear, Lapinski walks right in after the bear and a confrontation ensues. "The hysterical impluse to turn and run was overpowering, but my mind screamed for me to stay calm because I was still in control. Though I carried no gun, I was not defenseless." Lapinski slowly backed away, "pleased that bear pepper spray had once again kept me not only safe but also in control of my mental and physical actions."  Did pepper spray keep Lapinski safe or lead him into trouble? A book titled Backcountry Bear Basics notes that, "Just because you have a can of pepper spray, don't go places you wouldn't go otherwise. Don't do things you wouldn't do otherwise. Try to guard against overconfidence." Grizzlies In The Mist author Chuck Neal urges people to carry pepper spray, adding that he doesn't because "I actually fear the 'false confidence' bear spray or firearms tend to convey to the bearer."  Time and again Lapinski tells tales where people with pepper spray walk into bear trouble they could have avoided. Sometimes pepper spray stops the bear from injuring people, but just as often the bear does injure people before being driven away. Lapinski is blind to the fact pepper spray might foster overconfidence that leads to confrontations with bears 
    It is difficult to identify with such unusual heroes as a cannibal and a self multilator even if the author throws the two of them redemptive acts in the final pages of the book.       The bizarre cast of characters does not live up to the stage it performs on.    I expected much more when the book was compared on the cover to Dr. Zhivago and Anna Karenina.....PLEASE.... 
 While I purchased the CD for the title song, I was a little disappointed in the rest of the CD. I guess I didn't know the group's repertoire as well as I thought 
 In the final book of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton series, the time has come for youngest son Gregory to choose a wife. Gregory has always been a believer in true love, especially after witnessing his seven siblings all marry for love. So at 26 Gregory decides that he won't just settle for marriage, but he'll wait until he falls in love. Which he does... in a heartbeat with a beautiful girl named Hermione Watson. The only problem is that Hermione is already in love, and that every other eligible gentleman also seems to want her. Herminoe's best friend, Lady Lucinda Abernathy, actually likes Gregory better than her friend's other suitors and much more than the man to whom Hermione has given her heart. So Lucinda decides to help Gregory win Hermione, only somewhere along the way she falls for Gregory herself.  On the Way to the Wedding was fine, but in comparison with the rest of the books in the series it was definitely subpar. The hero and heroine weren't even the focus of most of the book. By the time the two finally realize they're in love with each other, the story was more than two-thirds over. Not only that, but I never got the sense that Lucinda was as moral and upright a person as the ending of this book would have us believe. Not that I thought she was a lying wretch or anything, but to sacrifice one's life for the sake of one's family, you would think she would have demanded a little more proof than the word of a man who has treated her as a second-class loser for her entire life. And to have the man you love, or claim to, fall on his knees in front of God and the rest of the country and declare his love, only to have you turn your back on him and deny that connection is crap. Utter crap and I have not forgiven Lucy for it. Between that and the lackluster connection between the way the book ended and the first two-thirds (I think somewhere along the way the plot changed and there wasn't enough time to go back and make the whole book cohesive) I have to say that this is one of the worst Bridgerton books, and doesn't do justice to the ending of such an otherwise great series 
 To sum it up, I found this book to be base.  I think the IDEA of it was great, but the examples of situations and remedies for them were SO OVERLY SIMPLISTIC!  If you have no idea what anorexia or bulimia are, if you haven't a clue about the experiences of family and friends of people close to them suffering from the eating disorder, then by all means - get this book.  Otherwise, you might find yourself wasting your time and money 
 I almost always finish books, but I gave up here after 3/4. It's just a string of facts tied loosely together. If it was 1/2 as long and more tightly focused I would have recommended it 
 Since you're reading about this book, I assume you're interested in a scholarly work, as opposed to "Idiot's Guide" or "___ for Dummies" style.  In this case, I recommend that you read instead "The Legacy of Jihad" by Andrew Bostom and Hugh Fitzgerald, a scholarly work that is more comprehensive, better researched, and more objective.  I purchased both books, but after reading a few hundred pages of both, I decided to keep "The Legacy of Jihad" and return "The Venture of Islam" to the bookstore 
 Like Bernard Lewis, this author likes to portray a clash between West and Middle East.  But look at the other countries:  nobody is fighting the west, not even the Chinese.  Does anybody really think we can't get along?  This book is true only for the Middle East.    As for the rest of the thesis, that developing countries catch up with developed countries, this is a well known economic phenomena, nothing worth fretting over 
 I bought this book for a research project I was working on for my history class, and I never found a book more tedious than this one.  Kulikoff focuses his research on economic and demographic statistics explained in very long, boring paragraphs.  In addition to that he highlights the statistics with MANY charts and graphs.  For a reader wanting to know the social history on Tobacco and Slaves in the early Chesapeake, this book is NOT for you.  If you're looking for numbers and dates and charts, look no further 
 I made an unfortunate selection in purchasing this storybook before a similar review (H. Hudson Aug 14) was posted. Had I waited I could have benefited from that review. Instead I must post a similar review. The most disappointing thing about this storybook is the CD does not let the child know when to turn the page. We also expected to hear familiar voices for Pooh and the gang rather than just a full narration. At this price there are much better selections if you are going to be turning the pages yourself 
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 The religion of peace is at it again!  In response to the popes words, muslims all over the world respond with violence, destruction, rage, hatred, burning down buildings, burning papal effigies, issuing fatwas against the pope, and even shooting a 70 year old nun in the back.  Wow, such peace from a religion of "peace".  If Islam is a religion of peace, then all the guns in the world are pink flowers, and every nuclear bomb, a soft feathery pillow.  Violence for words.  Destruction for speech.  PLEASE!  This is a religion of war, and bereft mindless 70 year old bags like Noam have begun to lose a lot of mental function with age.  This old bag of a man gives Muslims free passes and blames America.    Question:  When will the world start holding to account the actions of Muslims, and stop blaming others, such as Bush, America, the Pope, or God knows who else? How many more innocent people will die at the hand of Muslims before the western world finally, and for the first time, holds the Muslims accountable for their own actions, rather than someone else?      Well Im sick of the left defending this vile cesspool of Islamofacism.  Im tired of the leftist media beating up on Israel and coming to the side of middle-eastern tyrants who shoot 70 year old nuns in the back in response to spoken words.  And then these radical leftists have the audacity blame the pope!  Can you believe it?!!  Yes, idiots all over the western world actually blame the pope for the mindless violence and destruction that followed from a spoken word.  Its unreal!  A grown man got a gun, deliberately aimed it at a 70 year old woman's backside, and deliberately pulled the trigger, purposefully killing her in cold blood....and yet according to socialist America-hating leftists, he couldn't help it.  Its not his fault...its the Pope's fault guys!    Respond to words with violence, and then blame the speaker, absolving the person who actually commits the violence of responsibility.  As absurd as that sounds, I'm sad to say there are actually people all over the world who think that.  And they are idiots (like Noam) 
 There are some good principles in the book, but its way to easy to get lost in all of the repetition and blandness. The section on fibonocci retracements was useful and seems to work well for me in practice; however, I didn't get much else from the book 
 Comparing to the great adaptations of other Steven King novels, such as Dolores Claiburne or Shining, this film is utterly bad. Most actors simply can not act, and the film suffers from a cheap, TV-like approach. If you expect more than cheap thrilling, then save your time and read the book. This movie is an offense 
 I bought this book hoping to learn about the Cal Ripken Jr. the man...But all I was able to learn from this book is that he is a baseball player.  He goes very little into his own life outside of the ballpark.  I would not  recommend this book to anyone that is not a huge Ripken fan.  D- 
 With all due respect to Richard Carpenter, this collection is a disappointment. I have a very high end audio system. If he was going to remix these songs, why not get rid of all of the excess and artificial sounding reverb and clean up the vocal tracks? Why not try to create an intimate in your room sound instead of the same old, tired, re-packaged sound. The SACD track only helps alittle. The vocals still sound edgy and grainy to me and since the original tracks were analog, this was in the mix or the mastering. Next time, go for a cleaner, more intimate sound, not the same stuff we've already heard countless times 
 This film is proof that an excellent cast cannot rise above inferior scriptwriting, directing and editing. Most scenes of this movie struggle against a script that sacrifices character development to the conveying of information. Mercifully, this is most blatant in the first 10 minutes of the movie in which choppy editing jerks the audience from scene to scene in a series of pogo jumps that instruct us on the childhood aspirations and early professional career of the protagonist, Gerald Bull. The ticker tape of facts continues through what must be the most leaden performance of Kevin Spacey's filmography, as he intones yet more information needed to convince the viewer that this is surely a very exciting film. Add to this the director's dispiriting decisions to have Arab characters speak to each other in English, and to have pivotal moments preceded far in advance by crescendos from the orchestra, and we can only be thankful that the flim provides, at the very least, a useful history lesson. 
 Im going to rate this product a 2 because I like it but I would change a few things if I could.  It does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff.  The couple of things I would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord, you can play along with the program but its only about 15 seconds, then  you have to stop and click play again.  I wish there was an option where  you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again.  The other thing is something a little more important.  The product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play, its called OLGA.  Well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore.  So you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the Beetles or Metalica or The Grateful Dead or anyone else, and thats what they advertise "Play hit songs". So overall, knowing all this I would have shopped around more.  Especially for the price, its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get is little 15 second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs.  
 I recently returned from a 3 month tour of Europe and took this book with me. While it did have a number of major European cities in it the actual information about them was definetly lacking. I found my self usually better off with out a book at all as opposed to only having this one. Several other travelers we met felt the same way and some were lucky enough to have Lonely Planet guides. For the money spent I'll stick to them or Rick Steves in the future. i.e. This book would take you to the train station/ subway but then fall short on what the heck to do to get a ticket!!! Which is important information stranded in 20 different stations/ subways a month each with different customs. Frommer's did do an excellent job of pointing out all of the gay and lesbian districs and bars in each city and the gay friendly hotels and shops... but they also have a strickly gay guide to Europe as well. The amount of space used for this information could have been better allocated for more pertinent information. I'll have to give a thumbs down on this book. Take something else with you or take nothing at all 
 I received a phone msg. from the vendor two days after I ordered this item from Amazon. A day after I received an email advising that they could not ship my order to a california address, and if I had another address outside  California to ship it to. I thought it was strange since I only have one address. I was looking forward to geting this item too.. 
 I enjoyed this film , but it has nude childern and I did not think it was needed in the story  
 only recieved one instead of 12 boxes and amazon not able to fix- still waiting for remainder of orde 
 I found this dictionary to be totally useless because it only goes one way, Arabic to English.  Which is OK unless you don't know alphabetical order in Arabic.  And for the price, you would expect it should be a two-way dictionary but it's not.  I found the Hippocrene Practical Dictionary to be much better, much cheaper, and it goes both ways (English to Arabic and Arabic to English) 
 I'm getting married again after 20 years of being single & was looking for relevant advice.  It was not to be found in this book.  It's a very traditional stodgy book for people who are afraid to break the rules.  There are better choices out there.  Hint:  look for books with the word "grownup" in the title 
 reads like it was written by an elementary schooler during recess and stereotypes every culture/character it tries to relate to the reader.  insulting to the intelligence of its audience. possibly the most laughable piece of garbage ever put into hard cover.  
 I started reading 'The no.1 Ladies Detective Agency' but could never really get into it. I liked the idea of this book however so decided to give the author another go. Sadly, although the book has some funny moments (Bertie's tantrums!)it never really gripped me. I love Scotland but am not familar enough with the places and slang terms so felt i missed out on the 'insider' comments. The book also has a very poor ending which leaves lots of loose ends and you end up thinking 'hold on what happened to..?' and 'what was the point of?'.  On the whole it is ok and i imagine if you are familar with Edinburgh you would enjoy it more than i did 
 We brought this book along with two others to the island.  This book and very little insider information and did not provide details on how to access and find hidden beaches.  Bring the Ultimate Guidebook to Kauai instead and that book will be your constant travel buddy.  I am actually leaving this book behind!  Save your money 
 This is not an easy book. The language is preety tough and the writer seems to assume that you already know C. The terminology is hard to understand. I went and bought an oreily book and I learnt alot more from that smaller book than this book 
 This could have been a valuable reference.  The front cover lists 39 names, some well known, others so obscure as to invite interests to learn more.  Try to find these 39 when opening the book.  Only in the Index.  At least two pages, as chapters, should have provided insight into the thoughts of these 39 names who appeared under the caption, "A History of Modern Psychoanalytic Throught."  However, Chapter headings only cover Freud, Sullivan, Klein, Fairbairn/Winnicott, Erikson/Kohut, and Kernberg/Schafer/Loewald/Lacan--and that's it.  Eleven theorists.    Toward the end of the book, the last two chapters appear to be the mission of the book--Controversies.  Two pages are devoted to why the authors think homosexuality is normal.  Uh-huh! They emotionally vent against the psychoanalytic view that includes binding mothers and detached fathers.  They grouse over psychoanalytic notions of homosexuality as a "pathological defensive, phobic retreat from castration fears" and renounce employing a "directive/suggestive" approach to treatment.  The authors cite at least one well-known activist by only calling him a "contemporary author."    While Chapter 8, Controversies in theory notes that "Freud regarded sexual orientation as largely constitutional" (p223), the reader must flip to the "Notes" section (p263) to read, "Freud termed homosexuality a perversion, because he considered only heterosexual genital intercourse to be the 'normal' sexual organization.  In the Freudian lexicon, perversions are pregenital fixations caused either by constitution (an overabundance of one or another component drive) or conflict."    The authors have an agenda to discredit theory and call it "expansion" and "transformation" hoping to convert readers to their own way of thinking.  In perusing earlier reviews of this book, they appear somewhat successful.  You might ask, are the authors simply preaching to the choir, or have these reviewers not thought through the material in order to provide credible opinion?  As far as this book being required reading for a doctoral class in Psychodynamic Theory, as one reviewer states, I would hope that expectations of a critical read would accompany such a requirement.  Some of the reviewers appear to be thirsting for knowledge...any knowledge concerning psychoanalytic theory and will drink from the first cup available, without question.   The book's authors, by using vague phases such as "In many cases" to denote Freudian thought to which they disagree, offer no examples to support their attack and leave the reader guessing.  Basic Books is a reputable publisher.  The reader deserves better.  I bought this book but returned it after a selective skimming through its contents.  Finding that the mission of transformation is a failure, the reader will only note that it accedes to political motivation of coveted views 
 This stupid book put me in starvation mode for two weeks. I mean, come on, a whole day eating grapes? I would be waifing around my bowl of grapes thinking of that disgusting skinny image of the author Juday Mazel when I'd  nearly scream! Don't buy this book -- it's pyschotic 
 IM not sure where to begin with this review, its not that the book was poorly written, quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal. It was quite infact extremely boring, by page 300 I could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point I have LOVED the gunslinger series, they were all very good from front to back. There is way, way, to much about Susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged, maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no Wastelands or Wizzard and Glass. It was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement. It got to the point where I had to try very hard to pay attention and often I would find I had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again. Im giving this book 2 out of 5, very poor story line, poor plot however it was written well I can only hope that the next book is better, cmon King give me the feeling Wastelands did, BLOWN AWAY!! rather than tired and exhausted 
 Try reading 'The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man' for some true scholarship and unbiased analysis of the Jesus myth.   Maybe too reality based for some of you 
 This is an essential book. I rushed to it after finishing The Double Helix, by James Watson; I was incensed by Watson's misogyny and eager to learn the other side of the story. And this is the main accomplishment of Maddox's book, that it does give the other side of the story in a thorough and detailed manner. Too often, however, Maddox's tone slips into defensiveness, and her feminism appears to be a position she arrived at not as a result of rational thinking but because of her bitterness at the many injustices women have suffered at the hands of men.   I was troubled by this. I admire Rosalind Franklin -- yes, I have to admit that my admiration was nourished to a great extent by Maddox's book -- but I'm put off by how much of her biography of Franklin is a direct, self-righteous and self-justifying response to James Watson's flippant comments in The Double Helix. I was disappointed, for instance, by how much time Maddox spends explaining how sophisticated Franklin's taste in fashion was, simply because Watson made a snide comment in his book about Franklin's clothes and hairdo.   Another problem with Maddox's narrative is its pace. I found the book very hard to get through; paragraph after paragraph plods on, heavy with detail and almost empty of energy. I read The Double Helix in three days, breathless with excitement; for all its flaws, Watson's telling of the story sparkles. I don't look, when I read, to be entertained at the expense of truth, but I don't want either to be given the truth in a dry and awkward way. And Maddox's syntax is often awkward; I found myself going back again and again over her sentences to figure out what she was trying to say.   This material -- the story of Rosalind Franklin's life -- needs a better and more evenhanded writer, one who has nothing to prove and is aware that a biography, no matter how well-intentioned, can, just like the badly-intentioned ones, tell only one side of the story 
 This book was written in 1921.  Read by my grandmother, mother, and now myself.  My Grandmother gave me her copy. My mother always said how she would have loved having a lunch box with compartments like Elnora's.  My grandparents were pioneers in Southern Alberta and times were tough and money sparce. School was not free and it was hard work getting there.  This book shows us how to focus on what is important and what it takes to get there. Though Elnora is fictional, there were thousands of young women trying to get educated in that time period. Thank you Gene for a beautifully written story of triumph and love 
 Do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick? If so, look no further, this book is for you.   I understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so "grotesque" or "disturbing" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book.   The entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time 
 First let me start by saying that Manji has very little knowledge of Islam for someone who claims to have gone to an Islamic school.  I will not say madrasa, because the word has been misused, purposely, to give darker skinned peoples an exotic barbarity. The word simply means school and is used, worldwide, to refer to schools both secular and religious, simply coming from the Arabic root "to study."    I do not understand why Manji rants and raves over and over about ijtihad  (reasoning independent of the past religious opinions), but one thing is for sure, and that is that she has no knowledge of Muslim movements of the 18th centuries onwards.  One of the most successful movements, founded by Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab, known as Wahhabism by those opposed to it or Salafism by its proponents, has as its founding principle the use of ijtihad, as it wished to break from what it considered was corruption of Islam by all Islamic groups and empires after the community of the Prophet.   However, ibn Abdul Wahhab's followers had to change his theories, as he only accepted the Qur'an and Sunna (the traditions of the prophet), but these traditions were not collected with any authority until the 9th century, meaning in order to claim the Sunna, the Wahhabi's would have to accept the consensus of the first 3 centuries of Islam (which includes the Golden Age).  The problem with the Wahhabi's is that they are a exceptionally right wing, and so their independent analysis (ijtihad) is inherently conservative.  Why doesn't Manji know this.  It is not a hidden fact.  She doesn't even need to learn Arabic to find this out, it is written plainly for anyone with knowledge of English.  You don't need a comprehensive study of Islam to know this, though you would think it should be a prerequisite for anyone claiming to have the ability to tell the world of the trouble with Islam

 Junk. Junk. Junk.  Mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working 
 My all time favorite book is Deavers THE BLUE NOWHERE and The Testament by another author.  I think this book is on the bottom of my list.  It was a combo term paper and novel.  I wonder where the editor of this book is.  Where was he/she?  It read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them.    Don't worry Jeff, I'll still buy your next book...I've bought them all but please ...get a second opinion about your editor. I good editor wouldn't have let it go out in this shape. 
 Time has proven that Arnold Forster and Benjamin R. Epstein should have given their fellow countrymen a little more credit than they did all those years ago in 1964 ( three years before I was born).  There was never any "Danger On The Right".  The only danger was that these two liberal Democrat partisans would continue to hear people's opinions that they would have rathered had silenced.  In a true democracy all voices should and must be heard.  Not once in this book did I read the concession that Conservatives have a right to express their opinion as much as any one else under the First Amendment.  The authors simply branded all on the right as bigots, nuts and warmongers that needed to be shunned into silence.  Right-wingers speaking their mind was a problem that needed to be *FIXED*.  I bought this book at a used book store for another point of view, but I find myself only offended that my beliefs and values could be so mocked.   "Danger on the Right" is not much better than Michael Moore and his 9-11 "documentary". I will say only that the Soviet menace - which unlike today's liberals the authors saw as a threat -- is no more and for that we do not have the Jimmy Carters or the George McGoverns to thank for it.  We can thank the Anti-Communists -- Joe McCarthy, the John Birch Society and William F. Buckley jr. included.  We won the cold war -not you -- without a shot fired as the Iron Lady put it at Ronald Reagan's funeral.    This book is going into the recycling bin so that maybe in its next incarnation it can come back as something more useful - like a paper sack I can carry my lunch in to work. 
 Up to late 1944, Hermann Knell, a teenager too young to be drafted, was having a comfy-cozy war in his hometown of Wurzburg, a small city in Bavaria. His family was burgerlich and the fighting fronts were far away. If the Germans were burning down 20,000 Russian villages -- frequently with the villagers still alive inside them -- well, what was that to him?  But when the Royal Air Force finally got around to Wurzburg and the Knells lost most (bur far from all) of their property, then that was a crime that deserved exposing. Many years later, after an adult life spent in free countries (which evidently didn't rub off on him), Knell proposed to explore the origin, effectiveness, legality, morality and suffering of strategic bombing.   This is ground that has been plowed before. Knell has very little new to offer, despite spending much time in the operational archives of the bombing forces. And the old he recycles is, too often, mistaken or, sometimes, deliberately dishonest.  Sometimes it is hard to guess which. It seems pointless to lie about the destroyers-for-bases deal and call it clandestine. An examination of contemporary newspaper files reveals the error. But if not deliberate, it was a very strange mistake to make.  Other misrepresentations cannot have been mistakes; they must have been deliberate. The most egregious example is his statement that the Germans accepted Hitler to solve their domestic problems, but without enthusiasm. We've seen the newsreels. We know how enthusiastic they were. The comfortably middle-class, like the Knells, disliked Hitler personally as an upstart, who spoke uncouth German and was an Austrian, too. But they loved Hitlerism, at least as long as the fighting was far away.   In his summation, Knell becomes quite upset that the bombing of Wurzburg may have violated conventions of war. You would think that Germany adhered scrupulously to those rules, from anything in "To Destroy a City" to the contrary. Occasional lapses, like the pointless bombardment of Paris by V2s, are shrugged off: "Why Paris had to suffer again as at the end of World War I, no doubt adds to the idea of German Schrecklichkeit."  No doubt.   (Knell leaves Schrecklichkeit untranslated. It is the same word that gave us the name of the movie cartoon character Shrek and translates as "frightfulness." No other language has such a word. The Germans invented it, well before the Nazis, to inform the Belgians, who objected to having the country invaded and ravaged for no reason, that the Germans could be a lot worse than they had been up until then if the Belgians did not knuckle under.)  Knell proves, again, what was already well known: the strategic bombers vastly overpromised the military effectiveness of their method. For someone so concerned to distance himself personally and the Germans collectively from the Hitlerian crimes, he makes an odd argument.  This is that the morale argument was even-steven. The British argued that their population would not crack under bombing, but the Germans would. This, if you accept Knell's position that the Germans were unenthusiastic about Hitler, should have been a correct argument: a population of free men and women fighting for liberty ought to have had higher morale than an oppressed population restive under the hobnailed boot of (to say the least of it) militarism.  That, in the event, the German morale proved as unshakable as the British suggests that, in fact, the Germans had no problem with Hitlerism. Plenty of other evidence points the same way, but Knell seems oblivious to the import of his own words.  Because of the numerous misstatements -- whether they arose from  carelessness, ignorance or dishonesty -- I cannot recommend this book to anyone who is not thoroughly familiar with the history of Germany and of military affairs between 1914 and 1945.  However, to the sophisticated reader, "To Destroy a City" can go on the shelf with the other books that are useful in destroying the "good German" myth.  One last point. While it may be true that Knell was studying Shakespeare when the bombs fell, I do not believe he was studying it "from a beautifully printed and leather-bound volume  . . . Printed in London in 1623." Which was burned by the RAF. No, I do not believe he was reading a First Folio.    
 I've at various times subscribed to Stuff, Maxim, and FHM magazines.  Stuff was the only one I ended up not resubscribing to.  It has its moments and the photography is fine.  I would describe it as Maxim's younger brother.  It's whole attitude seems to be like the younger sibling of the popular kid in high school, and this kid then tries to be hip by being just as funny, etc., but it is forced and very juvenile.  It just is snarky and predictable after awhile.  On the other hand, I'm not 21 anymore either, and maybe if I was in my 20's I would find this the height of humor 
 Whenever Clint Willis finally gets around to compiling a book about hating Saddam Hussein and Osama bin-Laden, then Clint and his cronies might have some credibility.  As it is, their blind hatred and knee-jerk reactionary attitudes against Conservatives have produced reams of commentary...loopy, mean-spirited, small-minded ideas that are fundamentally wrong about nearly everything in the world.  These pundits' loathing of Conservatism has blinded them against the real enemies of America and freedom.  Ironically, it's the Conservatives who provide the strength, vision, and courage to defend the rights of Liberals to spew their opinions. Hatred...that's what this book is.  At least truth in advertising is in effect here 
 I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A "Left Behind" book 
 I just wanted to reiterate the other one stars... if you liked the first UCs, then you may be disappointed.  The emphasis seems far less on electronica and more on an eclectic mix of low key music. Some of it isn't bad, but I feel like someone stuck a lot of remakes of old jazz songs into what had once been a compilation series of forward looking trance/electronica, etc 
 unable to view because of incompatible format (as you warned me!)However, my ancestor James McLintock of Barnsley, Yorkshire, England sent John Wayne an eiderdown quilt for making the film (which is why I wanted the DVD)so..... 
 Well, I have seen the One Interactive Show book, and quite amazed with what I have seen, so I expected the same visual richness from this book, but I was wrong. This book mainly focuses on dull, not-so-cool websites. Ofcourse, as we all know there is more to interactive design than web design, but this book doesn't have that broader perspective 
 When our book club selected this novel, I was enthusiastic ~ the premise appeared to leave so much room for the development of great characters and a great story.  However, after the first chapter or so, I kept waiting for the big "wow" factor...and it never came.  I found most of the characters unsympathetic and not very well-developed.  Like other readers, I finished it out of obligation, but never gleaned any enjoyment from reading it.  
 This may be a fine book for parenting/motherhood, but it is not Lao Tzu's tao te ching.  His classic text has broad applications to many areas of life, but the stretch to motherhood is too great 
 If you like crummy productions with scarred and silicone filled breasts, buy it.  If you want to see real yoga adepts doing real yoga - this aint it!  The women couldn't do Tai Chi or yoga if their life depended on it.  A real hilarious video, buy it if you feel depressed and want to laugh real hard.. 
 Because of its glowing reviews and my strong interest in learning more about Edinburgh and Scotland, I had high expectations for this book. I was very disappointed. It assumes that the reader has a strong knowledge of Scottish history, so the neophyte will not learn much. Yet, the book is written at such a superficial level that a knowledgeable person will learn nothing new. As another Amazon reviewer points out, the book is essentially themeless and has no point of view. I know that the book received many positive reviews, but it is difficult to know what audience will get much out of it. I havn't been this disappointed in a book for a long time 
 Peter Lorre's ,"The Black Cat",is charmingly done.Yet,the other two are stinkers.I'm a Corman fan,but this was boring and silly to watch.I think they had a good idea ,bringing the trilogy it to the big screen.But,this version and interpretation of Poe's masterpieces didn't translate well at all.So ,beware of the dog 
 Rand is ever the hyper-rationalist, believing that all problems can be solved by using humankind's unique endowment of "reason." After all, didn't Boethius claim mankind is the superior species, because "man is a rational animal?" Rand certainly agrees with Boethius' apotheosis of reason.  But, what KIND of reason? There are at least TWO types of reason: (1) hyper-reason based on a priori, deductive, syllogistic logic, and (2) ordinary reason, based on a posteriori, experiential, inferential logic. (There is a third kind of reason, called mathematical propositional calculus, that is a blend of the two, while heavily favoring the latter.)   Rand is certainly in the first camp, and that's her problem. Almost anything can be deduced syllogistically as Aristotle and Aquinas amply demonstrate. Pick up either author's tomes on how the world "is," and you'll quickly find out they were consistently wrong. They both started from one or more false premises, that lead to false conclusions. More importantly, people, no matter how "rational" they may appear, do not used deductive, a priori logic as consistently as Rand would suggest, much less like. It's not in our nature. The very few that do are "hyper-rationalists," and they are more annoying than satisfying.  Most people, if they use logic at all, use the SECOND kind, and this is the kind that is based on experience, on inferences drawn from direct experience with the senses. It is the development of this kind of reason that has led to the most ambitious outcomes in the history of mankind. But this reason admits up front that nothing is certain, all knowledge and morals are contingent, and that there are no eternal truths. This is the logic Rand deplores. Not because it isn't the most appropriate, but because everything is contingent -- there are no "objective" or "absolute" conclusions. Rand cannot assert her dogmas under this kind of logic. Only "hyper-rationality" of the FIRST kind will allow her to do that!  Most philosophers and scientists have minimized or abandoned the first kind of logic for all the myths, false dogmas, and irrational conclusions that ensue from it. Read Aristotle or Aquinas to see just how wrong they are on practically everything, yet these are the two best paradigms of the first kind of reason. Rand is one of the last holdouts for this kind of irrational logic. That is why the "objectivist" project is doomed from the start; it merely changes the "old" dogmas for "new" ones, "old" myths for "new" ones. That is why here project is doomed from the start, and why reading her "new" claptrap is no better than reading the "old" ones. No serious student of philosophy or science uses "her" kind of logic anymore, and nor should we 
 I just don't get the sixties guys sometimes. Maybe forty years ago pointing out the flaws in the American experience was novel, although coming twenty years after Henry Miller and others,  it was probably not that shocking to anyone that payed attention to the various literature. This is a smug book, with its smugness somewhat masked by Southern's cutesy tones and farcical situations that he sets up. Maybe it was groundbreaking then, but it comes off as a bit dated and ineffectual now 
 Simply put, the only song worthwile is STILLBORN, the rest of the album sounds like that group of idoits who play with their "band" in the garage down the road. You would call the cops, but then again you feel bad about how much they suck and decide they need to spend that time practicing 
 I have the iGo Juice^70 model PS0055.  This is a three-in-one adapter -- AC, vehicle, airplane -- that can power and charge your notebook computer.  With an optional accessory, you can also charge another mobile electronics device, such as an MP3 player, a cell phone, or a PDA.  In other words, the Juice can charge at most two devices: a notebook, plus one other small gadget.  Unlike what some other reviews have said, the Juice cannot power/charge more than two things at a time.  The Juice comes with 10 tips for a variety of notebook computer brands, from Compaq and HP to Fujitsu to Panasonic.  Unfortunately and unforgiveably, no tips is included for the popular Sony and Toshiba notebooks.  You can call iGo to request a free Sony- or Toshiba-compatible tip; whether they'll actually mail it to you is something I can't verify.  (There doesn't seem to be a way to make the request on their website.)  In addition to the heavy brick-style power converter/transformer ("adapter"), you get an AC cord, a vehicle/airplane combination cord, and a notebook input cord.  Let me explain.  The AC cord and the auto/air cord bring source power to the Juice brick; i.e., you plug one of them into the approriate power outlet and also into the Juice brick.  The notebook input cord then goes from the Juice to your notebook, with the correct power tip attached.  Be sure to use the correct tip!  Not only is it a question of size and fit, but also polarity and probably also voltage control.  Unfortunately, iGo's tips are poorly made and there are many reports of poor fits.  (Everything in the package is made in China.)  (Tip: even though the Juice comes with an insert of notebook compatibility charts, be sure to go to the iGo website for updated and correct compatibility check!  The charts have a number of mistakes.  For example, it says my Fujitsu C2210 notebook should use Tip 11, whereas in reality it's Tip 3 that will work, something that's correctly stated on the iGo website.)  On the notebook input cord is a connection point for an optional secondary powering system.  You can buy one of these on iGo's website for about $30.  With this and an appropriate tip (another $10, not included in the secondary system), you get a secondary adapter, i.e., an adapter for the Juice adapter!  This secondary adapter then allows you to charge/power your cell phone or PDA or MP3, one at a time, each with its own corresponding tip.  For example, if I were to get a tip for my Sanyo SCP-8100 cell phone, I'd have to buy an A02 tip, in addition to the secondary system (which is called "DualPower Accessory for Mobile Electronic Devices" on iGo's website).  OK, the Juice works as advertised.  It can get hot during operation.  My gripe regarding its design is it's rather bulky, like a brick, and a bit heavy at 7 oz. without the cords.  The traveling weight -- the brick plus the three cords -- weigh at least a whole pound.  iGo does give you a cheaply made pouch to store them.  Now, if you get the secondary power system in order to charge/power another gadget, the secondary adapter will weigh at least 4 or 5 oz., excluding its own power cord!  Again: out of box the Juice cannot power any cell phones, PDAs or MP3 players.  You must purchase an additional secondary adapter and the right power tips.  I simply cannot how some reviewers lied about or omitted this important hard fact about the Juice.  My biggest gripe is how expensive this whole thing is.  I paid over $100 for the Juice and the special tip for my Sharp Actius MM20 ultralight notebook.  Then I found out in order to power my Sanyo cell phone or my HP iPaq Pocket PC PDA, I'd have to buy a secondary adapter plus one tip for each!  The additional costs, and weights, can add up quickly.  Not to mention the headaches of managing all the power tips.  Let me say this: I regret my purchase of the iGo Juice.  The small AC adapter that came with my Sharp Actius MM20 weighs a mere 2 oz.  The AC adapter for my Sanyo phone is a mere 1 oz.  Together they take up far less space and weigh far less than the Juice brick alone, not to mention I don't even have a secondary iGo adapter yet.  Nor do I plan to buy one.  (So right now I can only charge one notebook at a time.  I still need to carry the Sanyo and iPaq adapters.)  My advice: don't waste your money, seriously.  If you need a vehicle adapter, get a cheap one from Radio Shack or direct from your otebook manufacturer.  The airplane plug in the Juice package is useless as most modern airplanes accommodate regular power plugs.  The Juice package, for its high price, doesn't even include world outlet adapters, so you can only use the AC cord in the U.S.  A very poor value IMHO 
 I have read in another review that the "John Wayne Collection" edition of this DVD is of poor picture quality. I have the "Collector's Eddition", and the picture quality is terrible on this one as well. This is a great movie, a classic. It was filmed beautifully in Ireland and deserves better then this. I hope the studio will one day give this outstanding movie the treatment it deserves 
 I'd heard good things about this book.  This was a quick read.  I was irritated by the main character's low expectations in life.  When I was done with this book I was like, "what was the point of that?"  Enough said 
 Well, it didn't appeal to me personally -the story, the characters, no, usually I am such a big fan of Steven Spielbergs' various masterpieces, and despite "Always" I'm really impressed with his talent of making such different movies, and so well. Jaws, Close Encounters, Schindlers' List, Minority Report -you name it! The man is a genious, no argue there -but this movie simply hasn't got the touch nor the style 
 While I've seen worse films, few films that I have ever seen combine action, comedy, and dialog as sloppy as this overlong, over-loud, over-stupid, over-profanic, and over-offensive piece. The editing on the action scenes, which are frequent, is undiniably bad, making them frustrating and nausiating to watch. The movie's comedy all falls flat, and is often offensive and mean spirited. The dialog is incomprehesibly bad; I don't mind that there's a lot of profanity, I mind that profanity is used to be sick, mean, and stupid. The plot from the begining is just a throwaway. From the beginging with, of all things, a drug bust on a KKK group, with frequent use of the N word to try to be funny, and an action scene like all the preceding others that half the time one can't tell where another person is shooting, I knew it was bad. Why, oh why, does this movie clog over two hours? It should have been 90 minutes max, but even if it had been I'd still be saying the same things. Terrible film. 
 Usually I like fantasy, comic fantasy, parodies of all sorts etc... but I simply was not able to move beyond first ten pages -and believe me, I tried! After all those good reviews...  being not able to read even half a book - this almost does not happen to me (usually I feel obliged to author to read more, before passing judgement). BORING 
 Man, there's no way to describe this movie.  Slow, boring, unidimensional, bad plot, really bad acting... Really low-budget (in a bad way)  I'm not gonna get my time or my money back. I bought it based on the reviews, and they were really off... Even if you enjoy the gothic ambience, believe me, it's really bad.   You've been warned 
 nonstick layer chipped off even though I have never used metal utensils on it.  the handle is not tightly attached to the pan - it shakes.  very disappointed. 
 I had never read a John Grisham book.  But I am generally a believer in the notion that "if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so."  So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing.  A week ago I picked up "The Street Lawyer," and I was prepared to be entertained.  Boy, was I wrong.  This book stinks to high heavens.  This man cannot write.  "The Street Lawyer" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches.  I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy.  Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.  I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words 
 Sorry, Babs.  You can't call yourself a Christian and also be so judgmental about your son or the so-called "homosexual lifestyle."  If we're throwing labels around, we might just as well call it "the heterosexual lifestyle." Gimme a break; it's 2004, lady. 
 Therese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood's boys are invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house) and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon commited suicide. Only four girls remain.  The act which Cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed. The father saw her immediately, the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum. Four of the Lisbon's neighbors, four young boys, suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the Lisbon girls, who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world. They got hold of Cecilia's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide. The eldest decided Cecilia was a dreamer, and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window, she thought she would fly.  With their youngest sister gone, the remaining Lisbon girls grow closer to each other, stranding themselves further from the outside world. When school starts again, they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened, not ever mentioning their youngest sister. The run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however. The usual profuse apology to the mention of the word "death" and the like.  Trip Fontaine is the most popular guy in school, the object of desire to all of the girls at school... Except for the Lisbon girls, which is of no importance to Trip until he sets eyes on Lux. Trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty. In the beginning, he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she's not interested. But after his consistent courtship, Lux falls for his charming ways. Trip then attempts to convince Mr. Lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the Lisbon daughters to Homecoming. After Mr. Lisbon talks to his wife, he agrees to Trip's request, knowing nothing but Trip's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions, on the understanding that Trip have all of the Lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew.  After Trip explains the situation to his football peers, he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely. Meanwhile, the Lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the Homecoming Dance. Though one pattern is used for all four dresses, each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail. Once they pick up the girls, they stop midway to the Homecoming in order to smoke, Lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke. They then drive to the dance. Trip and Lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol. Another one of the Lisbon sisters and her date follow, but leave soon afterwards, not being as wild nor daring as Trip and Lux. At the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew, they are all there... Except for Trip and Lux, who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field. Deciding they must make their own curfews, Therese, Bonnie, Mary and their dates leave without them. After fooling around, the intoxicated Trip and Lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium. Trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves Lux there alone. When Lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why Trip is not there. She takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick (of course). But they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the Lisbon residence.  The girls, in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world, begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives. One of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls. Soon following, the boys begin talking to the Lisbon girls via phone. One day, the girls invite the boys to come over once Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep. The plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere, the boys hastily agree. They sneak over and Lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and Lux goes to wait in the car. The boys wander down to the basement while waiting for Therese, Bonnie and Mary, verbally expressing their hopes for the night. But then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters. She had hung herself. The boys, scared to death, run all the way home. Time passed, things changed, girls came and went... But no matter what, those four boys NEVER forgot the Lisbon suicides.  Ultimately, the movie was nothing short of queer. When trying to sum up the story in a few lines (such as "Follow the lives of the Lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors. A story full of obsession, gossip, lust, love, desire and isolation.") the story sounds quite unique and intriguing, but the story fell short of that for me personally. Partly because the Lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation. The movie, in places, is also extremely flawed. I do not believe Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon could've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services. In many parts of the movie, they should've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences. The whole movie was filmed in a style that I can truthfully say makes me rather bored. I would only suggest this film to, perhaps, people who like movies such as "Elizabethtown" which Kirsten Dunst is also in. But I personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future 
 A very boring and stupid film about college freshmen with a kindergarten maturity level. The movie is horribly slow to get to the point and is riddled with nonsense dialogue: I've heard better lines in 'Fast Times At Richmond High' thank you.    Altogether a very forgettable film that has a lot of talk about nothing. Don't believe the great reviews about this film: the film might appeal to the 14-17 year-old crowds fantasizing about how 'cool' college life might be with all the 'cool' people and 'parties.' If you're not in that category, skip this boring film and save both your time and your money.    
 I bought this book on faith, having greatly enjoyed "American Splendor Presents: Bob & Harv's Comics" (which was illustrated by R. Crumb). I expected a personal story, a slice of life, an attempt to make  sense of tragedy. But what I found instead was unimpressive graphics (this  book is NOT illustrated by Crumb!) and bombastic lectures on the mid-East  and domestic politics, including much anti-Israel commentary. The political  proclamations rubbed me the wrong way, but even if I'd been sympathetic, I  think I would have been disappointed by the bad art and lack of focus on  the professed topic 
 This calendar is fine.  I wished the photos reflected scenes of "SMALLVILLE" instead of 'Head-shots'.  
 Dr. Tributsch presents a dense compilation of a huge number of anecdotes of animal misbehavior before earthquakes.  He then presents a discussion, nearly as comprehensive, of the ways cracking rock might produce physical changes in the ground and air to incite the animals.  The layman learns a lot about how animals behave and what bothers them.  The stories come from around the world, and from prehistory up to the present.  Dr. Tributsch is clearly compassionate, and frustrated that few other scientists take his work seriously.  Unfortunately, the theory that pervasive cracking precedes most large earthquakes bit the dust in the early 1980s.  Worse, many of the dramatic precursory phenomena described in ancient literature have revealed no analogs since scientific instruments have been producing vastly more accurate recording of events around the time of recent earthquakes, casting doubt on the veracity of such legends.  So this book is not promising for learning new earthquake science (also, it is now 24 years out of date), and it is too serious for a light read.  Although his theories have not yet exhausted their most ardent adherents, this book is difficult to recommend to anyone outside of the history of science on the wrong track 
 This book is very nice and all but there is only one page each for the 1st . 2nd , and 3rd birthday and there are no lines to right on in the book only on some pages. So this book wasnt worth what i payed for it 
 I was scouting around for a new British crime series to start and heard good things about Peter Robinson. So, when I came across this second in the Inspector Banks series, it seemed like fate was telling me to dive in. However, I and my wife both found it a severely disappointing, utterly unimpressive procedural. I can only surmise the series gets better over subsequent volumes, because this is utterly average stuff.  Inspector Banks has recently relocated form London to sleepy rural Yorkshire and is still getting a feel for the lay of the land (following his first case in Gallows View). One day a retired historian turns up dead in a field near the village of Helmthorpe, leaving Banks with an old-fashioned whodunit. Pretty quickly, the stable of suspects is established: his widow (who inherits a nice legacy), his old friend and publisher, his mystery-writing drinking pal, his local GP and drinking pal, a local entrepreneur developer drinking pal, or the local folk singer he may have had a fling with a decade ago?   Like a latter-day Miss Marple, Banks and his plod underlings go back and forth from house to house, interviewing suspects and trying to tease a semblance of motive and opportunity from their statements. Of course, like the old-fashioned constructions of Christie, we are left with lots of semi-plausible motives and seemingly few opportunities. Banks is convinced the answer lies in a fateful summer ten years ago. Meanwhile, a local teenage girl brags about seeing something the night of the murder, placing herself in danger. Will Banks be able to get to the bottom of things before the killer strikes again?!?!?   It's all pretty bland stuff, and gimmick by which the murderer masks themselves is a bit of a groaner. The clues dovetail nicely, and Robinson's done a capable job of constructing a puzzler, but the story and characters are instantly forgettable. The writing is utterly without style or distinction and the Yorkshire setting never really came alive for me. It seemed a kind of generic green and pastoral land with insular people and cure stone cottages. All in all, very little to recommend here. 
 (I don't have time for a full review right now,so I will write a few comments and try to add to them.)  I knew very little about XML, so this sounded promising.  As of Chapter 8, my general comments are:      1.  The teaching structure is often murky.  At many spots, the authors don't seem to grasp what a beginner needs to know first in order to go to the next step.  This makes the material unnecessarily difficult and confusing.      2.  Instead of one example page, for some reason the authors will sometimes create one XML page to illustrate a point, then create another completely different page to illustrate the next point, then go back to the first one for the next point, etc.  It's inexplicable.  The book would be much easier to follow, and probably easier to write, if they built one XML page from scratch and used/modified it throughout the book.      3.  There are too many editorial screw-ups, such as "Figures" that are labeled incorrectly or don't exist -- that is, the text will say "see Figure 7 for the output" and Figure 7 will be the wrong one.  I really have no patience with expensive books that don't bother to pay for one thorough copy-editing.      I am currently on Chapter 8 (XSLT), one of the worst-written ones.  After a completely unnecessary discussion about "procedural" versus "declarative" programming (I imagine every reader is at least basically familiar with css, and if not, it is hardly difficult to understand "declarative" programming), the book just starts throwing XLST terms at you, with no foundation as to what they are doing or why. I finally gave up and pulled up the online W3C tutorial.  This tutorial is free, covers most of the material, and is well-organized and easy to understand.  Teaching in logical order isn't that hard.      There is a ton of good information in "Beginning XML", and the information on how to find, install, and use software such as Saxon and Schematron is invaluable.  It is a shame that the authors didn't take the time to actually give the book to a few XML novices and then rewrite it as the introductory text it is supposed to be.  The poorly organized writing at least doubles, and often triples, the time, energy, and painful confusion needed to learn the material 
 Standard Heinlein Disclaimer: Heinlein is a frequently-polarizing figure in American literature. The people who dislike his work (e.g., A. Panshin) seem to *really* dislike his work, and often for reasons that seem to me spurious. The people who like his work are in many cases blind or too forgiving of Heinlein's problems as a writer. I like Heinlein's work quite a bit, and find all but two of his novels consistently enjoyable, but I would not rate any but one or possibly two of his books as being the "best of the SF genre." They are for me, however, always enjoyable, and that is no small thing to find in an author.   And as you may have guessed, this is one of the two.  (The other is "Rocketship Galileo" which, in my opinion, only suffers from the mistakes of a person new to writing novels, and a hoary "Nazis on the Moon!" plotline that, to put it mildly, has not worn well with time.)  The story behind this book is, apparently, that Heinlein was ill as he was finishing it, and it was published without the traditional editing cycle that he usually employed.  Could be.  Frankly, it's hard for me to imagine editing making this novel more readable.  This is a relatively interesting idea (a man's brain transplanted into a woman's body), but as many others have pointed out, the execution is poor.  Frankly, there's not much story here at all, aside from a man exploring what it's like being in a woman's body.  But the exploration is by turns dull and absurd.  Man in woman's body has many sexual flings!  Man in woman's body poses nude for a painter!  Man in woman's body cooks dinner for widower husband!  Man in woman's body finds that piano lessons he took as a boy are now useless, but he can run secretarial equipment!  The thrills never stop.  There are any number of other irritating things about this book (personally, I find being forced to try to pronounce "Joan" as "Joanne" really irritating, but that's probably just me [If you want it pronounced "Joanne", spell it that way, Bob!]), but I'll let you read the other reviews.  The summation is, for this lover of Heinlein, who has read almost everything he wrote, I can't reread this novel.  And for me, folks, that's really saying something 
 If you have really loved the other boleyn girl by the same author...then this book will be disappointing as it does not have the thrill factor like the other one did. This book failed to engage me and I had to put it down several times. The author must have done extensive research but emphasis is done more on the plants/garden than on the actual story. I Usually finish reading off an entire novel within 3-4 days but this one has been laying around for the last 3-4 weeks 
 This book is probably a better read in the paper version.  Sandra Burr's male voices are somewhat shrill and detract from the story.  Not my favorite narrator.  Susan Ericsen's reading of Coulter's The Maze was better. 
 The characters are two dimensional, the relationship shifts are inexplicable, and the story lacks cohesion and closure. Anti-climactic at best.  Take a pass 
 A bunch of aristocrats with long and silly names run around playing at  James Bond in cravats.  If Regency Romances, excruciatingly detailed  accounts of attire, and sentences like: "The tall man with the  dangerous eyes knew that someone was going to die tonight" flip your  skirt; with a little bit of that ol' pagan magick, faeries, gypsies, tramps  and thieves thrown in for good measure, this book is for you.  The only  vaguely interesting character I encountered before I gave up on the book  altogether was one Rupert St. Ives Dyer, Captain His Grace the Duke of  Wessex [ouch, huh? you think that's bad.. everyone else has at least five  more names.], a sort of Jim West/Lestat in tasseled riding boots.  Maybe  someday I'll go back to the book and see what kind of wacky and  off-the-cuff espionage that dashing Duke is up to for the rest of the  story, but I doubt it.. maybe if I'm in the mood for a little Duke from  UNCLE, or a good chuckle. 
 Brown Girl Peer Review  To my Peers:   I would recommend Brown Girl to all of my fellow peers.  This is a story that shows many problems.  One was that most of us do not have positive remodels to look up to.  Therefore, we just go about our life without anyone to look up.  To the same exact way, the character in this story grew up also.  However, always someone came so that we can look up to.  However, that does not always happen to us.  So there are certain times or situations that are not the same as our life but most of the time we can relate to the work.  As a person in life. So we can really understand what the character was going through so we would be able to say that we would have done the same thing.  Therefore, we would under stand the story a lot better.  In addition, like in the story, we could do better in receiving feedback and using it in a good way .so; we can use that to improve our selves.  This would show that we understand what we are doing. And we can go further into detail in every problem in the book. And further understand what the character was going through. 
 This is the sort of rubbishy book you get from writers who are sufficiently well-established not to need to make the effort any more.     The book lacks any worthwhile plot. It just meanders from A to B to C to D until, presumably, the writer thinks he has written enough arbitrary random material in a clever-clever manner to call it a "book". Then, the end. Off it goes to the publisher.    The content is unnecessarily overcomplicated. Too many characters, in too many places, are brought in. Too many clever things are said for the sake of saying clever things. Not enough happens. Result: a mess, cobbled together, a boring old-fashioned pretentious book that wastes the reader's time.     2/5          
 I liked this when it first came out b/c I was 16. I was a rebel, wanted to be part of something different. This is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a while.  Favorite song is Mongoloid...totally strange but rocking song. "Uncontrollable Urge" rocks (in a weird way) and Come Back Johnny is almost a conventional song. Satisfaction is completely unique but its not a good song.  The group was obviously trying to do more than music and develop a KISS, multi media, making money kind of thing.  I saw them live (they were horrible) during their hey day. The most interesting thing about them is while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream, DEVO is still as odd of a group as ever. Mark Motherbough does a lot of soundtrack work (Rugrats) and you can hear the DEVO in all of his work.  Anybody that gives this novelty group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is. DEVO came out as a Goof, not as serious musicians. They got big in the 70's b/c they were part of the new wave and kids (like me) were looking for alternative music that we can claim our own. 
 Foods are conveniently organized alphabetically, but portions are not clear so it's difficult to use when trying to track calories.  Example, grapefruit shown by size (diameter) - would be more accurate and convenient if all foods were shown in ounces and if the portion preceded nutritional content on every line 
 It is sad to say, loving the first part, that Starship Troopers 2 isn't the movie the fans wanted to see. It is a bad acted, dark, nothing near the original sequel. The charm that the first part had is totally gone.  The story takes place on one of the bug's planet, where a group of troopers of the federation get stuck on an abondon outpost, where nasty things happen. The entire movie is very dark. It starts out cool I must say, but that is all because in the first minute of the movie, the "would you like to know more?" part is shown, with footage of the first movie. But very soon after that, when the movie continues with a battle against the bugs, it goes downhill very fast. From those first few minutes into that battlesequence you can feel that there is totally no emotion in the acting. The fights could have been way cooler using certain cameramoves and giving the idea that they are having a hard fight: this is just a lot of screaming at each other in a bad acting way while you see a lot computer made bugs running around in some shots. Also, the film has a kind of video look that gives away that it went straight to video. That is sad, screenquality can do a lot for a film you know. A mist oppertunity.  Also, like I said, the movie is very dark. Not just dark as in story, but dark as in lighting. Of course it gives a moody and dangerous atmosphere, but a light here and there could have been just fine. Now it just feels like a wanne-be "Aliens" where the darkness actually worked, but here it just doesn't feel right at all.  So you may wonder: is there anything good about Starship Troopers 2? Yes, there actually is: The music is okay. It is music that saves some scenes here and there with nice heroic tunes and melodies. If that music wouldn't have been there, it would have been even more terrible than it already is. So good job on that part. Also some sets are well made and look professional, but sometimes it feels a bit like it has been filmed in a local gymhall.   To the fans of the original I must say this: You can watch this, but don't buy it, rent it some place. It is very dissapointing.  It has, like I said before, a kind of videolook, also none of the original characters return in this one. No cool Casper van Dien, no sexy Denise Richards: they are not in this movie in any way. The only actress that does return is Brenda Strong. The weird thing is that her character died in the first one, but she's back as a new character. But she doesn't save the movie in any way unfortunatly.  So all in all: The movie misses the direction of Paul Verhoeven, a bigger budget, good acting and the original characters from the original one.  Too bad, so sad, it really could have been something more than this.   Let's all hope that Starship Troopers 3, which is coming in some time will be a big step back in the direction of the fantastic original.  
 A friend lent me Good In Bed when I'd run out of ideas for books to read. I read it, didn't care much for the characters, and ultimately came out of the story feeling worse about life.   A few months later, I came upon this book, and since Weiner's actual writing style wasn't so bad, I thought I'd check it out. I didn't even finish it.   It seems as if Jennifer Weiner writes to make herself feel better when she's down; exalting overweight, plain-faced girls who have a tendency to whine, writing the petite and attractive with overtones of condescencion and contempt, and failing completely to create a male character with more than one and a half dimensions.   That said, this could have been a good story. Weiner does have some talent as a writer... her prose flows easily and is unpretentious, she speaks realistically even when the characters are hardly likeable, and the general ideas of the plot following the sisters' relationship, the connection with their grandmother, and what they do after their falling-out were all fun and interesting. I did very nearly almost care about these characters.   Still, I couldn't actually bring myself to give a hoot about these whiny, one-dimensional people. It's books like this that make me hate chick-lit so much. If you want to read girly stories, I'd rather you go to Barbara Kingsolver or Amy Tan... at least they have brains to back up their talent 
 To be sure, this album has some beautiful cuts. But that is overshadowed for me by the fact that while megastars Bartoli and Bocelli are featured so prominently on the cover, THEY ONLY SING ON 4 OUT OF 16 TRACKS. This kind  of misleading advertising is reprehensible. If I hadn't purchased this  while on vacation, I would have returned i 
 Sent flowers to my father's girlfriend in Florida for her birthday.  Flowers were left on the porch to die in the hot Florida sun.  My father tried to contact them and nobody responded.  I sent an e-mail that I am still waiting to see if they are going to do the right thing by either sending new flowers or giving my credit card a refund. I learned a lesson... stick to a name brand florist 
 I was seriously considering purchasing this movie, but luckily I saw it at blockbuster one night and decided to rent it before I made up my mind.  I think it was the smartest move I've made in my entire life because this movie turned out to be, not only the worst lesbian movie, but probably one of the worst movies ever made!  The reviews I've seen for this movie are way too generous I must say.  Believe me when I say that I am not a strict critic...I can be easily entertained by the corny ones.  But this one could not be salvaged, and one star is much more than it deserves.  The fact that is in black and white can be overlooked, but the bad acting, and pseudo-artistic scenes reminded me of a film made in middle school.  Unfortunately, my girlfriend and I were unable to get through the first 30 mins, so I am unable to rate this movie wholly.  All I can say is please rent it at least 
 Plenty of other reviewers have mentioned the mess that passes for the plot and writing; ultimately this is a parody of a hoax and so good for a laugh in places but offers little to sustain interest. By far the best part of the whole experience comes from the audiotape edition: hearing Burt Reynolds pause each time before pronouncing "Booger" with great relish is an absolute treat 
 Even though fans of HK cinema have as a whole come a long way since HK films were generally only seen in the states on Saturday afternoon television, some studios are still refusing to provide buyers with the option of seeing HK films in their original language with subtitles.  This film is available from Columbia Tristar only in a dubbed format, and for that reason I won't be getting the Region 1 release of this film 
 we saw this movie in Gym class and it is the worest movie any one has ever see 
 I made myself wait two days before writing this review hoping that I would be able to view this book in a better light but it is just not going to happen.  I had originally read the only other review for Murder at Shots Hall before purchasing it and expected that it would be just the perfect cozy mystery which I love so much.  I find that I am going in the polar opposite direction from the other reviewer.  This book was originally published as Green December Fills the Graveyard but the title has been changed by Rue Morgue Vintage Press to better define the book within the mystery genre.  (For anyone interested in the second Sarsfield mystery it was published as A Dinner for None in Britain and as A Party for Lawty in the U.S.  Rue Morgue has retitled that selection as Murder at Beechlands.  Just a little information so you will not accidently buy the same book multiple times.)  I did not like this book.  I am very irritated with myself because I even finished it but I wanted to see if I had spotted the murderer.  I'm also sorry to say that I had but not the reasoning behind that character being guilty.  I thought I would scream if I read one more time that Flik was lovely, just lovely, so lovely, really lovely, a lovely woman.  Why was she lovely?  Surely the author saw something in her imagination which made Flik lovely.  Her hair, her eyes, her skin, her figure, her hands, her feet???  What, what, what???  We are just told ad nauseam how lovely she is.  And that every man "fell" for her.  Once again, why?  This story all takes place over a very short time, a matter of days, and every single night the fog came down so that no movement could be seen, so thick that it actually dripped off people.  This village was six miles from the sea and yet the salt in the fog stung skin and eyes.  Really?  Now that's a long way for salt spray to travel.  But of course I'm forgetting.  Every night these poor people had to endure gale force winds (just to make it more interesting).  This book is so full of stupidity that I could spend all day trying to relate it all.  Several examples:  (1)  The SCOTLAND YARD INSPECTOR told the constable left on the premesis to take his boots off and walk around outside in his socks at about 2:00 am (in the mud, rain and howling wind) so that he would not wake Flik up, she needed her rest!  (2)The doctor (who had lived within a three mile radius of Flik for many years but had never met her until the first murder) actually almost balked against going to check up on a newborn infant whose parents thought he was dying because he wanted to go check up on Flik.  (3)A broom comes flying out of the air and manages to hit a police constable smack on the head while he is wallowing in the mud (again during all that howling wind and rain) in the middle of the night, in the middle of a muddy road but nobody can figure out where the broom came from and don't even really believe that it happened.  I'm telling you, my list could just go on and on.  When push came to shove, Flik was hiding two "dreadful" secrets which she could never allow to be revealed and so was willing to go to prison for murders she had not committed.  When the secrets were revealed they were pure piffle!  Nobody cared.  It's for sure that I didn't.  Detective Sergeant Arnoldson was a truly abhorrent character.  So much so that it made no sense for the powers-that-be to allow him to stay on the police force.  He had propositioned Flik several years previously for "special favors" after he rescued her from her burning bedroom after a bomb struck Shots Hall during an air raid.  (He spotted a military man's mess kit beneath her bed.)  She had turned him down and he was resentful and liked to gossip about her and insinuate that she was not a "nice" lady.  I got sick and tired of hearing about his red, sweaty face and his wet lips.  He also broke the law in his treatment of Flik during the murder investigation and yet his superiors put up with him.  Once again, my perennial question is WHY?    Well, now I've vented my spleen and I feel somewhat better.  If you still want to buy this book after reading my rants, go right ahead.  I bought the book based on one 5 star rating.  Now you have an entirely different assessment.  Happy decision making 
 This book begins with a letter from Jimmy Buffett where he asks Eng to not  undertake this project.  As a Parrothead, I enjoy hearing about the life of  Jimmy Buffett.  But, as Jimmy stated in his letter, if anyone is going tell  his story, it should be him.  Eng's writing style is, to sum it up in a  word, boring.  It was a chore to read and I filed it away after reading  only 60 pages.  Let Jimmy tell his own story and don't waste your money 
 This is not a serious examination of the "Paul is Dead" clues and should not be mistaken for one. The credibility of the book is nil because it is full of obvious factual errors such as...        Pg 14: Glen Campbell spells his name with one "n" not two. It's Bruce Johnston with a "t". Page 65: Though an early working title for the Stones lp was possibly Her Satanic Majesty's Request, the actual title of the final release was Their Satanic Majesties' Request.  (Neither title makes a whole helluva lotta sense)        Pg 21: Robert Fraser is misidentified as a "photographer," when in fact he was Paul's heroin-addicted gallery owner friend, a business partner with the actual photographer for the Sgt Pepper sessions, Michael Cooper. All this is detailed in the book, Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now by Barry Miles, released after Patterson's book, but Cooper is clearly noted as photographer on the back cover of Sgt Pepper!       Pg 27: Though Lennon may've said that Paul's major contribution to "A Day in the Life" was the "I'd love to turn you on" bit, surely his major contribution is the well-known middle eight, the "woke up, fell out of bed" bit. Paul wrote that exclusive of John and Paul sings it.             Pg 40: The assertion that it "took a full night" to record the "inner groove" is wrong. It was a fairly quick effort on Friday 21 April, part of a session that also included mono mixing for "Only a Northern Song." Surely the mixing took up most of the time. Why, when Patterson's own bibliography lists the Lewisohn book, The Beatles Recording Sessions (univerally admired for its accuracy), did he go to the suspect Dowlding for the lowdown on this issue? (See page 109 of Lewisohn).       Pgs 99-100: The Question and Answer session described as a "press conference" is no such thing. Those questions and the answers were authored by Paul McCartney as part of a promotional insert given away with some early copies of the McCartney lp. There was no real press conference, just a self-serving fake one by a recently solo Beatle.   There's too much reliance here on bad secondary and tertiary sources, and no fact checking. It's just plain awful. This odd pop culture phenomenon deserves  better treatment. (Comments are based on an earlier edition by Dowling Press

 This is a recipe book based on a diet philosophy but does not include enough details or instructions to be labeled a diet book 
 The history is very, very slow in developing and basically the whole book is noneventful. JB is sent to Bologna and the he came back. Period. Some people apparently wanted him dead! At least that's what Grisham tell us from the start, but then simply nothing happen.  But the most annoying thing - being myself italian - is to read so many mistakes in the parts of book written in Italian!! You fun readding this review? Notto really, I thinko but maybe picture the now you have how of italians parts off Brokker like sound 
 When I bought this I was looking forward to the blending of the flute and the harp. I have Wind Songs and some Hilary Stagg and other harp music  in my collection. This CD dissapointed me. The flute is much louder than the harp and when I turned up the volume to hear the harp the flute became too shrill for my ears. My second letdown is that there is no passion or emotion in the performance. It sounds like some musicians playing sheet music for money. The musicians are very good technically, but they are performing music that they did not choose or compose and their lack of emotional commitment seems evident. Michael Hoppe wrote the music but he does not perform on any of the songs. The liner notes say that this is music to play in the background while having diner. Maybe that is what it is intended for, it's just not what I was looking for 
 I regret having purchased this product.  I have not been able to use it for two months, after finally giving up trying to get it to work.  I have a very nice laptop running Windows XP Home, and encountered many problems.  I tried all of the avenues available to me through QuickBooks, online, via email, and on the telephone.  I spent nearly 25 hours overall trying to get the numerous issues taken care of.  Here are just a few:  The program would not convert my Quicken data; random script errors when you try to access help topics within the product; the phone # provided in the payroll demo is invalid; None of my info was viewable after bank download - it spontaneously failed to download my bank account info, after having successfully downloaded it for about two weeks.  I spent 2 & 1/2 hours on the phone trying to resolve just this one issue.  Part of the problem lies in the fact that I was unable to speak to a customer service person who's first language was English.  Each time I was on the phone, the customer service person seemed to continually ask me to re-describe the problem, then he/she would seem to be typing the info into the computer and waiting....then eventually telling me some solution to try, then eventually telling me they did not know what the problem was.  Not helpful in any way, though very polite. I'm sorry to say that this is a terribly designed, convoluted, over-complicated, non-user-friendly item which I would like to toss over a cliff.  
 Ralph Bakshi's boho fantasy Wizards, like Richard Williams' doomed Thief and the Cobbler, is a reaction against Disney animated features and shares many of its flaws, as well as many of its own. For all his talk about wanting to show Disney how to tell a real story with real passion, there's a real lack of story and worse, a real lack of feeling that the dull characters and disinterested vocal performances only draw attention to. But perhaps most fatal of all is the largely uninteresting animation that often seems pitched somewhere between Filmation and underground comics, with the more interesting (and potentially expensive) sequences played purely as two-tone still concept images with Susan Tyrell's flat narration giving the film an uncompleted work-in-progress look. The use of crudely rotoscoped footage from El Cid, Alexander Nevsky and Zulu for the choppy battle scenes is also rather too awkward to work, especially since it is never properly integrated with the genuinely animated characters. At its heart there's a vaguely interesting notion (it's certainly not developed enough to be called an idea) about the war between technology and magic - embodied by two brother wizards at each others throats for thousands of years - coming to a head when the bad one discovers the motivating power of Nazi propaganda, but too often it's simply clumsily reacting against the Disney formula rather than telling a story and you can see all too clearly the early signs of just how badly Bakshi would mess up The Lord of the Rings here.  Still, Fox's DVD boasts a nice widescreen transfer and a good selection of extras - an audio commentary by Bakshi and a 35-minute documentary on him and the film, various stills galleries, TV spot and two trailers. 
 I appreciate that this book has a listing of all of the obscure desserts from the last thirty years.  However some of them should have been lost.  Some of the directions are quite detailed on plate presentation but vague when it comes to the execution of the item.  My other pet with this book is the lack of consistency in portion size.  But can someone tell me what is the deal with the pigs?  For the professional borrow someonelse's, for the novice walk away, for the scientist; good luck cause not all of the recipes have worked.

 NOT WORTH THE MONEY 
 I would have to say that I am quite disappointed in what this book has to offer. I had hoped to see more tutorials on how to "perfect" a 3D female form, or human form in general, using applications like: Lightwave, Max, Maya and Softimage etc. with a heavy focus on anatomy. Instead, the bulk on this book is filled with Photoshop detailing techniques used to create a single STILL!!! image/scene and a gallery with many images that were obviously done in Poser and not very original. There are, in my opinion, better 3D anatomy tutorials around the web than in this book if you are interested in perfecting the art of building a realistic human figure. Thank god it wasn't expensive 
 Watch out! Be noted that www.EclipsedDistill.com is an empty site. There is no source codes available. You'll get stuck if following its tutorial after Chapter 10. It wastes so much time to make everything work without source codes 
 Yeah, this is metal madness!!  Scooter delivers such gruesome lyrics and vocals, the two guitarists do psychotic shredding riffs and blazing solos, the drummer does machine gun double bass at 400 miles per second!!  Metal is revived!!  As you can see, I'm joking.  Scooter has little baby squirel nuts, hence his super weak and annoying voice.  His lyrics about "I hate my parents, my daddy touched my privates" tripe is nothing new, and nothing pleasing to the ears.  The guitarists are very bad, they're downtuned and they only do powerchords and don't solo (because they can't).  The drummer is very basic, nothing special.  Bass?  Can't hear it.  Want the best album of 2005?  Go for "Ghost Reveries" by Opeth.  Opeth cares about music, Cold only cares about fame and money. 
 This is a good book with lots of great information about the incestuous relationship between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family.  The relationship is repugnant, especially in view of the fact that fifteen of the nineteen 9/11/2001 hijackers were Saudi nationals; in light of the apparent White House managed flights that helped some 140 bin Laden and Saudi royals to escape the U.S. only days after the murderous attacks on American soil.     Quite honestly, I wonder why an otherwise intelligent man like Craig Unger would receive and prominently display an endorsement from an extremist-bigot like Michael Moore on the front cover of his book.  Why not include on the cover other luminary Jew-haters and Israel-haters such as Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan, Cindy Sheehan, John Dingell and Cynthia McKinney?  Unger indicates no personal Jew-hatred or anti-Semitic tendencies in his book.  Why then did he resort to a bigot like Michael Moore for an endorsement 
 I'm a Wilbur Smith fan, so I bought this DVD thinking it would be interesting...silly me...are movies EVER comparable to the books?  Despite the excellent cast, the acting was third rate and the movie came across as sort of Danielle Steelish, not Wilbur Smith.  Given the talent involved in the film, the film makers could have done MUCH better 
 A rambling book, not very informative, with a marked liberal tone.  Not to mention disjointed-- as far as the editorial content goes, each chapter is a totally separate book with its own thesis.  I would have preferred a more  cohesive work supported by the weight of objective historical evidence  rather than repetitive tales of coffee house chats, anarchic newspapers,  and loud-mouthed ideologues -- written in a soporific stream of  consciousness 
 How does one write a book on city planning and not include a single illustation 
 Impersonating a mephitic injun in dungarees, Mr. Ward Leroy Churchill (who is not a native American) equates capitalism with genocide.  In person, he reminds one of a Leninist Queequeg with a masters degree, but lacking  the natural nobility that Melville attributed to the character.  He likes to jabber in academic lingo about the criminality of "Amerika," the zionist manipulated plague on leftist humanity.  He obviously sympathizes with the 9/11 fanatics who, in his estimate, are no different than fleshy smart bombs.  The fact that the fanatics intentionally target innocent victims is a detail that is trumped by the larger significance of his message, viz., that every crime is permissible if it is perpetrated against Amerika or her evil spawn, capitalism.  Such dishonesty and sociopathic indifference to moral categories used to insure that disaffected scamps like Mr. Churchill would live out their days in their rooms growing fat on TV dinners.  Now it lands you tenure at the University of Colorado 
 Don't let these good reviews fool you, this book plain sux. The dialogue is moronic, the characters are totally inconsistent, and the plot is so disjointed at times I had to wonder if this was a collection of short stories. This book tries so hard to be hip and edgy, but fails in a very annoying way. If you like the Alice-in-wonderland vurt world theme then I recommend you pick up The Diamond Age by Neil Stephenson. 
 In this book, one can learn that:  The internet started as a Defense Department project in the 80's p. 120  The proper way to search for pager manufacturing in internet web search engines is just to mention "pager", and not worry at all about other key words or symbols.  p. 124  That, according to an intelligence project, pager repair could be a great business.  p.139  I was lead to believe by a book review that this book would give me a great deal of information about passive intelligence gathering.  It does not live up to its promise, and lacks credibility for so many factual (1,1969 2, +pager +manufacture + industry +trends ) and analytical (3 I threw my cell phone away, and got another for free)errors.  What a shame 
 I was enthusiastic about this book when I first scanned it at the bookstore.  Later, after trying a few recipes and spending more time with it, I found it to be mediocre.  
 Despite being a comedy show, this turned out to be a rather depressing experience. There were a few amusing bits here and there, mostly there, but the targets of the satire were very lame.  Most of the parodies are from pop culture in the 1990's, so they are extremely dated.  The "Information 411", "90210", and Yakmin Shirmnov sketches were particularly painful to watch, as bad as anything on SNL.  I only made it through the first 8 episodes, and skipped the last 5.  The commentary on episode 8 was more interesting (check out Garofalo screaming how she hated kissing a sock puppet because she hates "sexuality".  I still don't know what she meant by that) than the actual episode.  As we know, Ben Stiller became a star playing neurotic, clumsy nerds, Andy [...] has done a plethora of drugs and seems to be on the path of being the next Courtney Love (in terms of obnoxiousness and drug intake), Janeane does supporting roles in mostly forgettable (and sometimes wretched) films (even though she does have talent), and Bob Odenkirk did Mr. Show and recently (as of November 2006) directed the awful Let's Go to Prison.  The only sketches I remember in which I mildy laughed were the "B Minus Time Traveler" sketch.  Stick with Monty Python's Flying Circus, which is still unsurpassed in sketch comedy.       
 I debated whether to give this book 1 or 2 stars. At first I was going to give it 2 stars as I thought LKH did a better job with this book than she did with the ABVH book Danse Macabre. I settled on 1 star after thinking about all of the things that bothered and/or disappointed me about this book.   My biggest problem were the scenes with Sholto. I hated what she did to him which I'm not going to say because I don't want to give anything away. However, to me it seemed like LKH was taking the easy way out. She took away any "specialness" and made it "ordinary". The scenes between Merry and Sholto could have been Merry and AnyGuy.   There were many other disappointments for me in this book. I'm not sure if the deficiencies of Mistral's Kiss were magnified for me as I had just finished reading a number of books (the latest from Kim Harrison, JR Ward and Lynsay Sands to start) which, IMO, were head and shoulders above anything coming from LKH lately. 
 This is the same review I posted for Green Mars. Also applies to Blue Mars. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.  I love epics, so I plodded through this trilogy, hoping it would get better, but it never did. I could sense that Robinson was extremely proud of the detailed world he created, but the story is horrible. The story unfolds glacially, with no sense of movement. Just when you think you might be getting attached to a character, he/she dies. Interesting story lines get dropped. There are long, long stretches where Robinson just describes everyday life, in excruciating, boring detail. There is no excitement or suspense, no character that grabs you. It's like some dull person's real life, full of routine, disappointment, and boredom. Robinson's typical character has a dream, begins to pursue it, getting you inspired, then gets killed or just gives up and joins the cause he was fighting.  This was the worst science fiction I have ever read. I can't believe I read all three books 
 How's J-Lo doing? Are Jennifer and Brad Pitt still together? What are the Olsen twins up to? Is Orlando Bloom a hottie or what?? Well...  WHO THE HELL CARES??? I got better things to care about than some news about these celebrities--people I've never actually met, let alone "know." Please, teenagers should be steered away from this kind of worthless, trashy magazine (other examples include Seventeen, YM, Teen People, and the list goes on). There are other issues which happen to be more important, you know. Try National Geographic or The New Yorker instead. The newspapers are also good 
 Although the book, with its illustrations, sidebars and accompanying cd, seemed so promising, in the end this is a disappointing compilation.  The book and cd waste a lot of space with some of the most commonplace forms of poetry - Mother Goose rhymes and limericks - to which many parents will have already introduced their children. The book veers from nursery rhymes to multiple poems involving death to Shakespearean sonnets. The choices of poems within each form introduced could have been improved upon - many are downright uninteresting.  Finally, I reached for the CD, hoping the purchase could be saved by the careful, luscious reading of selected excellent examples on it.  Alas, alack.  Two "professional" actors read - neither, unfortunately, possessing either the gravitas or the tonal depth to make the poems ring.  And again, the cd is littered with limericks and nursery rhymes 
 Imposible to do so with no item received 
 When Michel Cretu launched his enigmatic Enigma project in 1990 the group were literally in a class by themselves. Numerous soundalike acts cropped up during the 3 year wait bewteen debut and follow-up albums with only one single from the motion picture "Sliver" to hold fans over. The wait really raised expectations for something truly phenomenal which may be part of the reason why I count this album as the weakest of Enigma's first 4 studio albums.   The album opens strongly with "Second Chapter" as the familiar horn opening welcomes us back to the world of Enigma and the music suddenly changes and becomes darker before flowing into the "The eyes of truth."  "The eyes of truth" is to me the stand out track on this album but it is also the one that sounds most like the work done on MCMXC ad. With its heavy orchestral sample from Anne Dudley's "Songs from the Victorious city" and mix of Eastern/ Indian sound it is truly a  amazing if not ominous sounding tracks.  The album then segues into the worlwide hit "return to innoncence" which features lots of Enigma's signature sounds combined with Taiwanese chanting. The video clip to this song helped propel it to the tops of many music charts with its images of everything going backwards.  The album from this point starts to get a bit choppy. "i love you..I'll kill you" while a fan favorite reminds me of many Enigma clone acts who made music that could have fit into any low budget B-movie's soft porn scene. It does have some interesting beats but the Lyrics just seem at times ridiculous.   "Silent Warrior" begins and with the sound of farwaway crickets and soft music getting louder. Musically the track wonderful with heavy percussion and some nice keyboard work and tribal samples. Here again the lyrics didnt work for me and neither did Michel Cretu's vocals which are at times strained if not distracting.  We are next treated to "dream of the dolphin" a short peaceful piano based track with some vocals by Sandra that soon fades into a reworked verions of "carly's song" called "Age of Loneliness." Thsi track features more of the overtly sexual themes that were present on the act's first album along with heavy female breathing and chugging dance rhythms.  A psychedelic guitar and voices singing bring the listener into "out of the deep." Initially I was horrified by this track when I first heard it as it reminded me of re-interpretation of The beatles' "Lucy in the sky with diamonds" but on further listenings the song works. Cretu again takes lead vocals but they work here as the song has a "rockier" sound than "silent warrior." The video clip is one of Enigma's best featuring a knight who goes to an abandoned underwater castle and the painting's come to life. I am still baffled as to why this clip was left off their greatest hits DVD.  Finally the album closes with "cross of changes" which features a few spoken lines by Sandra before closing out in the true Enigma fashion with the horn closing.  "Cross of Changes" overall isnt a very cohesive album compared to MCMXC ad. In retrospect I think Cretu was experimenting with the Enigma sound diversify it which hurts the album overall. Not a terrible album but In my opinion definetly the weakest of the first four studio albums 
 I notice several other reviews mentioning faulty/defective consoles arriving. Well, I received my first Schwinn 438 about a month ago. I put it all together, and realized they did not ship an AC adapter with the machine. I contacted Amazon, they told me to either send the machine back for another or contact the manufacturer. I contacted the manufacturer on Saturday, they were closed. I contacted them the following Monday and they told me the item was on back order, but, I could buy a compatible adapter from Radio Shack. I did. I came home excited to use my elliptical, unfortunately, the console did nothing but beep at me..very frustrating. I contacted the manufacturer again, they advised me that the console was on backorder and would not be delivered for at least 2 months. They recommended I send the unit back to Amazon for a replacement. I did so. I spent the better part of a night taking the thing apart and repackaging it...quite a job trying to squeeze it back in the box. About 3 weeks later, I received my second elliptical. Same faulty console problem, after spending another couple of hours putting the thing together. Contacted Amazon and demanded a full refund and return. They did pick the unit up, and did not make me take it all apart this time, but, I am still awaiting a full refund. I have since purchased a Vision Fitness elliptical from a real fitness shop in my area. I am extremely happy with the unit, although it was a few hundred bucks more. This was one horrific experience with Amazon. I wouldn't recommend buying this product, seems like they are shipping out defective units 
 The book touches upon certain investment subjects such as TA FA and news reaction in very limited detail which in my opinion could be a serious disadvantage to the newcomer with naive knowledge gained from the book. The book should of stuck to giving an overview of what is on offer on the Internet It should definately of included a chapter to the risks associated with investing online.  I think the reference made to Momentum investments is also not correct 
 Pramoedya is a master of the short story, and "Stories from Blora" is his finest collection. Sadly this translation is often cliched and often shallow. Pramoedya deserves a more nuanced translator than Mr. Samuels. Readers are advised to seek out the stories translated by Benedict Anderson and James Siegel -- scholars who have a far more sophisticated understanding of Indonesia and the author 
 This book still have the magic and mysticism of a distant planet, but is rather insipid and simplistic.  Very low-reading 
 I'm of the opinion that King's books rarely translate well into movies, and this is no exception. Some of King's work is fantastic,  but unfortunately, a lot of it is simply tired old themes with nothing new. This falls into the latter category.  A novel about a novelist, and one who has a hard time finding inspiration: Please Mr. King, which college creative writing program did you steal this idea from? The writer's ideas showing up in real life: From whence do these fantastic ideas pour forth?  I won't bother to tell you the ending, because if you have the poor luck to watch the movie, you'll have already guessed it by the time you're half way through. It's all bad and hackneyed, from start to finish.  I will give Steven King credit for putting his fame to good use though. If anyone without Mr. King's fame and built-in fan base tried to sell a story this trite, their manuscript would never make it through the slush pile.   Maybe it takes a bunch of bad stories like this to turn out gems like the Gunslinger series, but it doesn't mean that we have to watch them 
 In 'Guided Tours of Hell', Prose provokes disgust at Landau and annoyance with his unreal pettiness and insecurity, somewhat interesting on its own merit.  She brings up much more compelling and disturbing concepts of  sensationalism and exploitation of an event like the Holocaust, which,  mixed with Landau's preoccupations, make for an interesting combination.    The second story was a disappointment.  Any interest lingering from 'Guided  Tours of Hell' disappeared once I started 'Three Pigs in Five Days'.   Prose, throw us a bone!  The idea of a man messing with his woman's mind is  interesting for a few pages, but our heroine is too abjectly pathetic.  A  joyless and tiresome read 
 If people of influence and those aspiring to such a position want to ensure that the poor stay poor and wilful manipulation of trade is the norm, this book by Joseph E. Stiglitz is the one to read, to know how to maintain this inequality. Terminology abounds which panders to the common misunderstanding of such things as fairness, monopolies, natural resources and  wealth, for example. He also has an annoying habit of telling us about what is bad, is going to suggest some remedy, and then skips on to the next thing to criticise.   Natural resources are, by and large, simply the raw material basis from which products are manufactured using capital and intellect in order to create things of value and subsequently wealth through trade. Crude oil and metal ores which are the significant natural resources are of scant direct value to most purchasers. Even crops such as wheat and bananas require much capital and labour inputted into their production and distribution, etc., to be of any significant value to the overall economy of a country.  There is no such thing as a private monopoly. Only a government has the ability to create and maintain a monopoly since government is the sole legitimate power which can use force and the law to prevent others from trading in the market. Microsoft is a favourite to cite, but this is totally wrong since Microsoft can not use force or the law to make computer users use their software or prevent the use of alternatives such as Linux or FreeBSD, for example.  The only fairness that is meaningful in a global economy is the freedom of opportunity which the abolition of trade barriers, government subsidies and regulation, the free movement of people across the globe and the implementation and recognition of private property rights enables. This would also have to include no government printing or minting of money, and central banking would have to be done away with, too, with private banks taking on this role. The private banks would be limited by a return to the gold standard with no fractional reserve banking permitted  Simply citing example after example of how the current norm must be further regulated by tribunals and of-the-moment political expediencies such as environmentalism is of no value whatever.   For a proper understanding about what will work in a globalized economy, I would recommend: 'Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics by George Reisman'         
 Anyone looking for an authoritative book on Bin Laden would do better to consult either of Peter Bergen's works, or Rohan Gunaratna.  While many of the details in Bodansky's book are plausible, and even correspond with those of other authors, no footnotes are given throughout, and many details (such as Al Qaeda's possession of nuclear weapons) are highly suspect if not patently false.  Bodansky portray's Bin Laden as largely a state-sponsored terrorist, and I think he fails utterly to show the grass roots genesis of Islamist resistance.  In fact, most of the book isn't even on Bin Laden, save one chapter, and deals with background events of Islamist terrorism.  Most damaging is Bodansky's failure to be transparent about his sources and convincing about his facts.  A critical reader should suspect an agenda or ideological lens in this work that is absent from Bergen and Gunaratna 
 Well....      I'm not happy with :(   The DVD's are cool indeed but the so cald H3D Viewing system   i don't like, why ?!   Sure i can see depth, sure i can see 3D with it,   But, NOT like in the pictures on the H3D Viewing System Box, nothing comes out of my TV or the so cald  come-off-the-screen effect, that's for sure...   And it's NOT that i plugged it wrong ! Or... i have bad eyes : 
 I was lured to this product by a rebate which made it free. The manufacturer Computer Associates burned me for the rebate and will likely do it to you too. As for how it works no trouble installing like others have mentioned but it slows my computer to a crawl. After a while you will shut it down and then you can resume surfing the net at normal speed 
 Very poorly researched and technically inaccurate. I read this book several years ago and was astounded by the technical impossibilities which were treated as fact. Here are two. 1)The USS Agusta is allegeded to have suffered flooding in several equipment bays and compartments after the collision with the K-219.Fact: US submarines are all single-hulled and there are no spaces to flood other than the ten or so major compartments, and if one compartment floods the affected crew will drown or be crushed and the submarine will likely be lost as well (killing the rest of the crew). Simply put there are no tiny little spaces to flood. Leaks can occur but either they are patched or the submarine fills with water.  2)As the K-219 sank she hit bottom without imploding. The Captain of the USS Agusta is alleged to have said "They build them well in Russia". This is pure garbage. The reason K-219 didn't implode is that she was already filled with water before she reached crsuh depth (which for an American submarine would be no deeper than about 2,000 feet and perhaps for a Soviet submarine maybe a few hundred feet deeper except for the Titanium-hulled Alpha class, which can dive to perhaps 3,000- 4,000 feet before imploding).  Only a very thickly-hulled purpose-designed research submarine  can dive so deeply without collapsing.  These are just two extremely glaring technical defficiencies of this book which suggest that the book is more fabricated than researched 
 My daughter and I had listened to the first two audio books, "The Bad Beginning" and "The Reptile Room", both narrated by Tim Curry, so we were very disappointed by "The Wide Room." Tim Curry was a fabulous narrator, why did they not continue to use him? His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction. Curry's fabulous, velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story. Lemony Snicket narrating his own story is truly an "Unfortunate Event! 
 Evolution was one of the most hyped albums back in 1997 my sophomore year of high school. Naturally I rushed out to get the album and on my first listen I found the album to be weak, especially the fast tracks. Seven years later I re-bought the album and gave it another listen; as an adult I found the album to be stronger than I thought. Boyz II Men like Jodeci before them have always been the strongest with ballads and this is apparent on the singles Doin Just Fine,Never,4 Seasons Of Loneliness. Shawn's writing skills were apparent on the song Doin Just Fine which is one of the strongest songs on the album, however there's is a lot of weak material on the album. Songs such as Girl In The Life Magazine, Baby C'mon and To The Limit all seem forced and aren't song with that much heart. In my opinion truly evolved on their EXCELLENT fourth disc Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya. 
 Did not care for the songs. All songs were about cheating on husband or wife and very depessing. Would not reccommend this to any one 
 I completely agree, which is why tomorrow, I suggest every african-american basketball player leave their 40,000,000 contracts behind and exit the game....you know, to make a statement.  And then you can ask Kobe the next time you see him drive up in his lambourghini mercielago how he feels about it.  :)  Is this guy serious 
 I haven't read this book, although I expect that it is probably very good since J.A. Jance wrote it.  I have buying all her books for some years. However, I have been buying paperback books for a lot longer, probably longer than Jance has been writing.  But NOW, book publishers, not satisfied with an average increase of more than 30% in the retail price, have come up with a "new" size for more comfortable reading.  BALONEY!! It's for greed! I do not intend to buy this new size.  Having carried paperbacks in my briefcase for more than 50 years.  I doubt that the publishers will even notice.  After all, I am 80+ years of age and the volume of my book buys are of little interest to the new breed of publishers. I will miss my many favorite authors but not for long. Goodbye, Adios, Adieu, and vaya con DIOS.  J. Dwayne Taylor - jdlet@tstar.ne 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 I have never read a Danielle Steel novel, but my friend bought it when we were inter-railing through Europe last week so I picked it up out of sheer boredom.   The grammar is atrocious, and the repetitiveness highly irritating. How many times do Sasha and what's his name need to break up and get back together? How often does Sasha need to cry about this artsy guy?   This book was so annoying that I had to literally put it down and stop reading it.  I will never pick up another Danielle Steel book, and I am still appalled that the publishing world even let this one be published! 
 Rather than a concise history of the Middle East this book offers only 146 pages of brief summary of outside powers effects on the region.  This isn't a history of the Middle East, it's a history of how Europe, the US and the Soviet Union interacted with the Middle East. Though undeniably important in understanding the region, Western and Eastern relations with the Middle East are not the only reasons for studying it. There is more going on, far more, that Shlaim does not address, and it opens a large crediblility gap.  What is missing? A lot.  This might be a good book if it's only goal were to teach people a very concise history of Western and Eastern relations to the Middle East, so perhaps it is just poorly titled. The information that it did offer though seemed good enough, and it provided a fair overview of US relations with the Middle East, but I expected more and was dissapointed 
 Can it be, only 183 pages for this price in a self-published book that uses so many internet sources, takes from others' works, robotically organizes by states and dates, and hardly any thoughts from the author 
 this monitor makes random beeping sounds so lould that we thought it was the smoke detector. We even replaced our smoke detector thinking it was broken only to find it was this stupid monitor. Do not but this 
 Just received the German 4 disc digipak. GOOD NEWS. played 10 mins of both - no problems. Menus are all in English (or German) all the extra's on the English R2 SE's are here except for the photo gallery.  The sound is very good and the restored english mono is BETTER than the MGM 5.1 also on here with the commentary and German mono. The 5.1 sounds muddled compared to the mono which is strong and has good clarity and separation.  Picture. No problems I could see on my 6ft screen via InFocus 5700 projector from an Arcam FMJ-DV29 DVD player. Player is set to progressive playback and did not have to change anything.  Only watched first 10mins of each but doing A-B comparisons with the English R2 MGM SE's the German ones are noticeably better, they look less washed out, contrast is not set so high and colours are a lot more pronounced especially on Fistful, which is why I bought this set, but also on Few Dollars More as well.  They are also cleaned up a bit more as well as most importantly Few Dollars More is at last the full version, which no MGM DVD is worldwide..... 
 The only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck. I've read a number of James Patterson books and while I'm not a hard core fan, I've enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell.   As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour).   Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller.   The twists at the end - "he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...." by the end, I just didn't care.   James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end. 
 I had not read Danielle Steel in several years.  I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable.  I was very disappointed with this work 
 I only bought the cd at first because of the song I can't help falling in love with you, so I figured I'd like all of the others because I liked all there other hits but boy was I in for a real suprise! Besides the songs "I can't help falling in love with you" and "Floorfiller" the cd is not worth listening to in my opinion. I thouht some of the songs had no meanings. I defenitely recommend their earlier music and cds instead of this one 
 This is not scholarship, this is bad science fiction. If it was possible to give a book less than one star, I would--preferably minus five. All of Gardner's books are ridiculous, but this one goes even further than most. If anyone thinks this is scholarship, I suggest they actually read the footnotes and follow up. They will find there's nothing scholarly about it. I am all for alternative history, if it IS history. I'm also for identifying fiction as fiction 
 Please check the price as the book in Hong Kong is about $25 US doll 
 Trash all the way.  The writers not only insult their characters but also readers who may find themselves and their style/taste looked down upon in the most offensive way.  Any book that insults and alienates it's readers in such way deserves one star, but the book also comes short in plot, character development and dialog.  Don't waste your money and time, if you must read chick-lit, you'll do much better with your money if you buy the B. Jones' Diary or the shopoholic series 
 Just a few years ago, "Elvis: 30 #1 Hits" was released on CD. It contains roughly the same number of tracks as "Essential Elvis" does, and most of the tracks here are available on that compilation.  There have been very, very many Elvis "best-ofs" released over the past few decades - some available through stores, others often available through infomercials by companies licensing the music.   I guess my point is this: they're re-releasing this stuff every other year because they know they can milk Elvis' back catalog for all its worth and people will keep on buying. I work at an album store and the day of release I had numerous requests for this. Meanwhile, Elvis: 30 #1 Hits is still just as good.  If you don't have any Elvis Best-Ofs, this is a worthy purchase. If you own any, though, I wouldn't say it's worth dishing out for again. I really wish they'd stop re-releasing greatest hits compilations a million times for Elvis, because it's getting ridiculous 
 This book tries to cover everything and succeeds at very little.  It covers everything from how to build a smoker from a used refrigerator to recipes.  But.. none of these topics are covered extensively or very well.    The illustrations are weak; the recipes are very weak; and, the general process discussions are haphazardly organized.    I bought this book on the strength of the other reviews, but am very disappointed 
 I enjoyed "Temple" but this book was just awful.  Reilly's books are full of amazing, improbable but fun action scenes.  You spend a few hours suspending common sense but having a good time.  In this book however there were two elements that were just so bad that they ruined the rest of the adventure.  1) The career Marine captain has a romance with an NCO who reports to him.    and 2)There was a bear family that played a key role in the story - mama bear, baby bear and papa bear.  Right.  The only place you will fine a papa bear in a bear family is in Goldylocks.  Read "Temple" instead 
 I liked Terry McMillan's "The Interruption of Everything", so I was really looking forward to reading this book- but it was one of the worst, most frustrating books I've ever read. First of all, the writing is on about a sixth-grade level. Example: "...Charles asked me if I wanted to dance. I said yes. So we danced. He danced like a man who was sure of himself. He watched me. I watched him. He smiled at me. I smiled at him." That's when I rolled my eyes and gave up. Unfortunately it was on page 365!! From then on I scanned the rest of the pages, just to satisfy my curiosity about what would happen to the rest of these characters. Secondly, most of the characters are complete morons, except for Gloria, who seemed real to me. (Working mom, single, trying to do the best for her son...) The other three jump into bed with EVERY man they meet, usually within the first three hours of meeting him. Then they whine and moan about how there are no good men out there. Well, DUH!!! Perhaps this is the point of the book, self-fufilling prophecy. I do like the title. It describes that feeling of waiting while what you want (husband, job, baby, etc.) hasn't happened yet. But this book was a disappointing waste of time. 
 As a PIC beginner I was hoping for more than this book provides in the first few chapters.    As already pointed out the title is very misleading; there certainly aren't 123 "experiments".  Many of the 123 articles are to do with the ins and outs of programming in C.    The typos and other mistakes don't help either and don't fill you with confidence when what you do doesn't reflect what the book says will happen, e.g. experiment 7, p31 where the LEDs I get aren't the same as indicated, and looking at the circuit, you'd never get the LEDs lit as indicated in the book.  Sloppy.  
 I bought this book for my Mom and she tells me she is amazed at the amount of information it contains.  She says it has everything 
 . I should have judged this book by its cover and resisted the purchase. There are indeed, thirty pages of recipes utilizing phyllo and pastry as depicted on the cover. Many sound quite good if your conscious will allow you to partake of their high fat content. Fried food is prevalent among traditional meze recipes, especially individual pieces. Phyllo recipes using a stick of butter to tame the leaves of pastry are subsequently fried. The book contains sundry recipes for fried cheese.  Once a person's eating habit and cooking methodology have left the fat-oil-grease-bond, it is increasingly difficult to look back and find enjoyment in unnecessarily heavy fat laden dishes we have programmed our taste and diet to abandon.     Meze offers a dearth of palate cleansing combinations. One lighter attempt combines the unlikely pairing of watermelon with vinegar, feta cheese, and onions. The spoiler in the Beet and Feta Salad for me was a large amount of brown sugar and nothing to balance it.   Many recipes fail to excite my adventurous nature; Fluffy Fish Roe with Almonds, Trout Whipped with Potatoes and Olive Oil, or Marinated Raw Anchovies. Others fail to excite my palate, and additionally, are fiddly to make; Pan Fried Olives Stuffed with Fish Roe, Deep Fried Squid Stuffed with Cheese, Deep Fried Stuffed Eggplant.   Meze does not contribute to my health or cookbook library needs. 
 I agree with the previous reviews. The ad is misleading. The description said:  "What's in the Box: Queen-sized pillow-top featherbed"  I assumed it was an actual feather bed too. now i have to find a feather bed to put inside. Amazon should correct their mistake in the ad and put up a picture of the cover only.   
 you can tell that Choking a 50 Million Dollar deal runs over into selecting musical guests for this Project.alot of Has-Beens or Could have acts featured here. that Comedy Central Contract if Signed would have probably brought more legit Music Acts 
 This book tries to explain how and why the media would try to send out its ideals to the masses through a selective exposé of certain television programs such as THE SIMPSONS, BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, REN & STIMPY SHOW, MURPHY BROWN, LA LAW, COPS; political and celebrity personalities like the BUSH's, BILL CLINTON, WILLIAM BORROUGHS, PHIL DONAHUE, RUSH LIMBOUGH, PEEWEE HERMAN (Paul Reubens), THE JACKSONS, MADONNA, ICE T, and even quite peculiar for me even the whole controversy with one of my personal faves U2 over the legal frictions with a parody band called NEGATIVLAND (which is rather more documented on the documentary feature flick of the said group) and even more so about the band that I often refer to -  JESUS JONES regarding their music video for their perrenial track "Right Here Right Now" and the advent of MTV's outbreak with the likes of music videos from A-HA; BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN; and even more so mentioning the likes of `wanna-whats' like R.U. SERIOUS, and the cult of Genesis P-Orrige called THEE TEMPLE OV PSYCHIC YOUTH - the book nearly gives an impression that the author is culture-shocked, and proposed to infect likewise with the `memes' (ie. A term used by the author to refer about the certain data/info's that are being assimilated n=by the media which in turn affects to influence the masses, at least in the way I understood it and could simply put it) it presents to expose - however, the whole matter is subject to the particular perspective preference of the readers personal comprehension.  The book is said to have been "revised and updated" from a two-year's span by 1996 - even seems quite un-innovative even from that time, and most of the authors' analysis are nothing new. Rushkoff, although being quite informative nevertheless from time to time with the book only seem to mainly dwell on a surface level, when what we need is to see more of the primal motivating factors behind the dissemination of counter-culture trends and ideas which Rushkoff attempted to disseminate within the length of his work. 
 I really do not feel tend skin works as advertised. The irritation to my neck persisted and if anything had only gotten worse after applying as instructed. One good thing is that you if you are like me and have trouble waking up in the morning --- tend skin helps for that! Just take a strong whiff and you'll be alert and ready for your day!  
 I'm a newbie to this Zope, and would really like to see some working examples of this product, so I can at least compare what is correct to what is in this book.  None of the examples I've come across so far work!  What's worse; I cannot figure out what's wrong with them because I DO NOT KNOW ZOPE YET!  I bought this for $., and I guess for examples, its ok.  But man, if you want to come across as an authority in something, it wouild be helpful to make your books' examples workable 
 Being a student of Mr. Walker, I had to read this book for his class, and failed the test on it.  I would have read it, but I couldn't keep my eyes open when I tried to.  I does have a couple of humerious stories, but most  are very boring.  TEACHERS: Please do not torture your students with this  book 
 I love this film.  It's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing.  I was thrilled to see it being released on DVD , UNFORTUNATELY it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used.  I have only viewed sections of the film so far but EVERY frame I have seen has surface dirt or scratches.  In one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture.  I was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves.  I'd have given 5 stars if it had, so the minus three is for the appaling print .  One of  the worst I've ever seen 
 I purchased this product at a B@M retailer (my first mistake?). The unit is attractive. The coffee function works as advertised.  Upon setup, I discovered that the espresso function was inoperative. I had to wait until a weekday to contact the Krups customer service. They were not particularly responsive, but ultimately agreed to pay for shipment to their center, and, upon verification that it was inoperative, they would replace it.   One month later I received the replacement. Upon setup, the replacement did make espresso. However, the next day the espresso function again failed, this time with different "symptoms" (initiation of the pump, then failure with blinking liht and display. I again contacted customer service, and now they offer a $10 refund of shipping (The return label function is "inoperative at the moment), with shipment of another replacement item upon confirmation of shipment.  Krups refused a refund. The retailer, of course, will not refund, since I now have a replacement. So I am now well into my second month of ownership, with no espresso!! (And, my warranty is ticking away....) MY best possible outcome appears to be months of hassles, assuming I ever receive a functioning product... 
 While I remember listening to their previous album "Lemon of Pink" and being blown away by the  sampled instrumentation and assured flow of these surreal compositions that rivaled the organic electronic innovations of Mum, I am sad to say the new album sounds something more akin to mediocre, experimental b-listers Styrofoam (who have done some good work despite that comparison). For some reason I was under the impression that this album was a B-sides album, and I still hope it is, because if not, then I feel the majority of fans out there seriously misjudged the talent of this band, acrediting the first two albums to a drug-induced vision. This all too apparent drug induced not-so-much-of-a-vision shows it's ugly head in the format of too many overbearing, if thought provoking sound clips with not enough musical substance to back it up. Hopefully these guys will reaffirm their gifts with the next release, but I know I don't speak alone when I say that the transcendental moments of amazing electronic fusions found throughout their last two albums are all but replaced by shoddy, juvenile gimmickry that actually does feel lost, yet safe.  
 For Ron White fans, there is nothing new in this book.  In fact the 304 pages are half cartoons -- which are somewhat funny but takes away from the real subject -- Ron White.  I'm a huge fan of Ron White but this book was actually boring in spots.  If you have seen him on TV or DVD - then you've seen the best he has to offer.  I'll buy his next DVD but an author he is not.  Nice try Ron but this one came up short 
 I'm a long time fantasy reader and was totally intrigued by the concept of a story with an Asian setting.  The first chapter had me hooked, and then it was all down hill from there.  It's easy to write off the criticisms as not understanding an Eastern culture, but that is just as basic as the writing in the book. Xiao Yen as the main character was whiny and uninteresting, I kept wanting to know what happened to Wang Tie Tie (Mei Mei).  She was absolutely the more worthwhile figure of the book.  Cutter does a thorough and detailed job describing the culture and I enjoyed most of it - although I felt at times it was distracting.  Reading this book it seemed that Cutter had some very clear scenes in her head but didn't know how to pull them together to make a cohesive and flowing story.  As I was nearing the end of the book, I kept wondering how she was going to resolve Xiao Yen's dilema with just a few pages left - and then it ended.  If she ever writes Mei-Mei story, I'll consider borrowing it from the library, but otherwise this is the first and last of Leah Cutter for me 
 bought book flipped through for 5 minutes, found good use starting a woodfire. all the info contained can be had for free on the internet. if youve been trading more then 2 days you already know more then the scope of this boo 
 The seller made a mistake and did not have the title in stock. They had later sent me an e-mail apologizing for the error and credited my account. 
 First, my background: I am not a mathematician, but an academic with fair knowledge of college math and even some advanced materials. I do greatly enjoy reading books about mathematics and mathematicians.   This book is obviously a work of great effort by the author. My difficulty probably came from the work's ambitious premise: offering mathematical and biographical history of Hilbert's problems. There are simply too many ideas and persons (some well known, others a bit obscure to lay reader like myself) to cover in one book.  The author dutifully and honestly gives references to his sources. My impression is that the author collected as much material as he could about each problem and solvers, and tried to squeeze the information as compactly as possible into the pages.  The result: the narrative is very methodically told - explanation of the problem, some necessary ideas introduced, who the major solvers were, then a short biography of each solver, when and where they were born, who their parents were, where they went to school, who they married and so on; then another cycle begins. Halfway into the book, I began to get bored.   I can imagine mathematicians enjoying a quick review of and glimpses into their discipline and heroes, but lay readers much beware. I recommend lay readers to check out a few pages  carefully online or at your local library to see whether you like it. I certainly didn't hate it but did not like it as much as I expected 
 I can't believe this band is still together because their music was never any good to begin with.  I know so many friends who are such huge fans of this band and I can't figure out why anybody would want to listen to these guys because their music is so dull.  Motley Crue is the kind of band where you can just take their record and just throw it in the garbage.  The only reason why these guys got back together is because they needed the quick cash to pay off their debts.  To their credit, at least they still have some fans left who will pay top dollar to see them perform live 
 Microsoft is simply sloppy with their programming!  "Open Office" is a better program, is open-source (meaning if you don't want some paperclip's help, you simply don't download that part of it) AND OPEN OFFICE is FREE! It is also compatible with most of the functions that MS Office uses (and is upgraded with new features faster than MS's product, which is a rip-off!)  MS's Office 97 was the best of the Office suites, even though it did have it's problems, Spending the money to supposedly "upgrade" to this (or any other Microsoft product for that matter) is simply burning your money!)   OPen-source software is FREE, it's perfectly legal, it is open t anyone decompiling it, so if you want to make your own custom goodies, you can, but then there are so many written by so many people willing to share, you don't have to develop your own, as there are already *SO* many freebie ones (and some low-cost additions by some places, but most are free) that if you want whistles and bells, or even a Christmas theme in February, you can get it for OPEN OFFICE! (Not so with this or ANY Microsoft product for that matter)  Simply sloppy programming - nothing more, AND you can get a fully functioning and compatable office suite for free legally 
 This was a movie that couldn't make up it's mind what it wanted to be. Some scenes are 60s western, some is slice-of-life americana, some is gritty evil filthy action movie, and there are about 4 other flavors. And because the movie doesn't know what it wants to be, it fails to be anything except a mess.  It's kinda like To Kill a Mockingbird crossbred with Unforgiven without any understanding of how to accomplish the goal.  Bowie got by in Labyrinth, but if this is any indication, he can't actually act worth klenex. Don't waste your time. Rent something by jerry bruckheimer. It won't have any more brains to it, but at least it will be prettier 
  I read this book for a project two years ago. I wasn't about to finish this book and had to move to another one. First off, this book lacks emotion. This character is so boring. She doesn't seem to ever feel sad or mad and to me, a book without emotion is just unreadable. I hated this book, but I don't like most Scott O'Dell books. Just go read another book 
 This book did not live up to it's title.  It didn't tell me anything about helping my children develop their psychic and intuitive skills. Sure, it told me not to repress them or make fun of them....but I don't do that anyway and didn't need a book to tell me that.  It's also more about children that already show evidence of abilities....not how to develop those abilities in every child.  It's very general talk ...I really didn't get anything out of it.   I was surprised b/c I've had friends rave about Doreen Virtue 
 - The LCD screen didn't work - The first DVD I played (hooked up to the TV screen) stopped reading at track 7... - I returned the item to the address writen on the box, it came back because the return address is a different one, so I had to return it a second time (at my expenses of course) - Despite having nothing to do with the fact that the item was defective I only got refunded 2 thirds of the purhase price.. 
 What is it with this book?  Everyone tells you how great it is and how you should be reading it.  You buy it, read it and then its like "what was that all about?".   Its an ok introduction to the Qabalah.  Over-hyped and the author seems to be good at self-promotion and comedy.  Two things which seem to me to be the pillars on which his writing career is built.  Please do yourself a favour, buy this book if you have lots of money and time spare.  Otherwise, just skip the idea completely.  Far rather spend your time and resources and buy John Bonner or Dion Fortune or David Rankine's books on the subject.  You will learn much more, be less iritated and gain knowledge rather than a headache 
 For me, the civil war is one of the most fascinating times in US history, as well as the time right after it. I felt that Eric Foner did not do his best to make the material interesting. On the contrary, the story was rather uninteresting. I found myself having to read many paragraphs over and over, because my mind kept wandering off out of boredom. There are many other books that are much more interesting. However, if you are a graduate doing a thesis on the topic, this book is very concise and detailed. You just need to be willing to read a really dull book 
 If you are expecting a comprehensive guide to arms and equipment, this is the wrong book for you.  It brushes past those subjects and touches on a bunch of other stuff that has nothing at all to do with the title 
 I'm a longtime Ry Cooder fan but this doesn't rank as even listenable.  Can you even hum or remember any of these weird tunes?  As a soundtrack to some PBS documentary, maybe this might be acceptable, but for pure listening enjoyment go somewhere else.  I bought this, struggled to listen to it once and won't play it again.  Go to "Paradise and Lunch" or "Bop Til you Drop" to get vintage Ry Cooder roots music 
 A soundtrack gets its power from the combination of images with the song. There were a lot of great songs from the movie yet they are not on this lame soundtrack. The soundtrack is okay, the best songs are from Sheryl Crow and Hootie but the songs that are most memorable from the film are missing. I understand that there were probably licensing issues precluding use but that is what makes the soundtrack good...to re-live the euphoria from the film 
 This is a "sweet" book that is very reassuring  and interesting to read if you don't have anything better to do.   But as a mom, who has time for this?   Don't we all look up things in a state of diress, hoping to find concrete useful information delivered rapidly in the least words possible? Well, you won't find that here.   This book is full of very nonspecific, sometimes outdated information delivered in a very wordy style. The whole book is written in long paragraphs.  There are very few tables or charts.  IT's VERY wordy.   Just to give you an example, I looked up Fluoride supplementation. It addresses the topic using nearly a FULL page, but never tells you the actual amount your baby should have depending on his age! More concise and concrete information is available in pediatrician Dr. Ari Brown's "Baby 411"!  I gave this book one star because aside from being too general, some of the information in it is outdated, or in the category of "old wives tales" ! Save your money and skip the "what to expect" book 
 I have read many of N.B.'s novels and essays, and he is a favorite author of mine.  This novel, however, seems more like it was written by someone else in his writing style, rather than written by Baker himself.  It lacks the substantive punch of his earlier works, lacks the beauty and emotion of a narrator relating to others in his world.  The pet duck in the story seems more real, compelling, and finely drawn than the narrator's wife and children.  (Maybe this is intentional?)  In addition, whereas past Baker narrators have described the minutiae of their lives with freshness and wonder, this narrator gets pedantic.  Does the reader really need to be told how a rear-window defroster works, or how to wash a dish?  I think for Baker fans, this might be a disappointment.  For a first-time Baker reader, however, it's a peaceful little book that might lead to his better ones.   
 What has happened to the Anna Pigeon in Track of the Cat, Superior Death, Firestorm, Blind Descent, Ill Wind? That delightfully flawed character? Why has Ms. Barr been so fixated on teen angst, rednecks, drugs & their ilk? Where is the Ranger who found it sometimes "embarrassing to be human",(a line I still use from time to time). Where is all the politics between the NPS & the Forestry, before Anna was "Boss"?   In High Country we have Anna impersonating a waitress in Yosemite NP as part of an undercover assignment. Aside from a collection of the sleaziest, foulest-mouthed characters you'd never want to meet, we have four missing teens who may or may not be victims of foul play, two chefs & an assortment of fellow waitresses who may or may not be on the level-and do we really care?  Personally, as a former die-hard Anna Pigeon fan, I feel that this is Nevada's worst Anna Pigeon yet, & it hurts to say it. As others have mentioned, she doesn't paint a very desirable picture of Yosemite-I didn't get the feeling I had been there the way I did with her earlier books. In Firestorm, I almost felt ashes on my clothing & in Blind Descent, I had that claustrophobic feeling of being trapped in small spaces & so on. Maybe it is because it was set in winter-which I would think would be a spectacular time in any National Park-it paints the whole atmosphere with brooding strokes. Nevada Barr is obviously seeing a different place than Ansel Adams saw through his camera lens! Anna always did survive planned "mishaps" in superhero fashion, but we loved her & wanted her to survive. High Country almost goes beyond superwoman! The incident with the deer was completely uncalled for. I also felt that mentioning the real life murders was in bad taste & beside the point of the story (not that there was much point.)   This reader has gone from waiting with great anticipation for each new adventure, wondering where I'll be transported next, to ho hum; maybe I'll wait until I can get a good price on the paperback. I understand that her next book is set in Rocky Mountain NP, a park near & dear to my heart. It will be interesting to see if I recognize it. Nevada, please bring back the old Anna Pigeon-flaws & all.  
 Is it just me? Sure, the art is good. Sure, we need Goddess depictions. But, I found the deck curiously lacking in any kind of traditional tarot symbolism that would clue the reader in to the various interpretations of the card. If you've memorized the goddesses and know what they stand for, you are in good shape. A beginner, however, won't derive much benefit from this deck. Pretty pictures may go a long way for some, but symbolism is at the heart of the tarot. I like a little more meat with my veggies 
 After reading this compulsively readable book (compulsively readable in the same way that eating a pint of ice cream is compulsive, reprimanding oneself afterward for submitting to the lowly instinct), I felt tremendous pity for Mark Kram.  I don't think he was so much concerned with portraying the "fateful blood feud between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier" as making an art out of agony, resentments and utter dirt. I would have been more satisfied if Kram had ended each chapter with the following lines: "All is darkness."  "All is darkness".   With respect to the reviewer who wrote that "anyone who hates this is into propaganda", I don't think so.  This seems like propaganda to me though.  Kram uses his limited (and embarrassingly pretentious) command of art to paint a  picture that simply does not exist: a noble, warrior-like Joe Frazier up against the terrible, name-calling, vicious, egomaniacal and power drunk Muhammad Ali.  Reality check.  Frazier was a guy who dumped his lifelong trainer, Eddie Futch (the guy who helped him get near the top), because of money.  Fairly recently he was arrested for beating up his wife while drunk.  (I guess Mark would blame that on some flashback to Manila).  He wasn't the timid, beautiful soul Mark would have you believe in his downcast dementia.  This is only another hallucination Kram sees fit to create in this piece of selective delusion.  Joe Frazier never quite forgave Muhammad Ali for being a better boxer and more of a public figure than he was.  I suppose that's understandable: but, for a guy who was so tough, Frazier sure was real sensitive when it came to the PR Ali pulled with him, just like he pulled with every other fighter he stepped in the ring with.  The difference is that Chuvalo, Foreman, Liston, Wepner, Patterson, etc--they didn't let it bother them.  Larry Holmes later pointed out that Frazier let too much of it get to him when it was only theatre.  Not nice theatre, no; but boxing isn't nice. (I don't recall Lennox Lewis crying about Mike Tyson wanting to, in his own words, "eat his kids".) ]  Kram does a cute and completely ineffectual job of minimizing every single accomplishment (and they were grand) Ali pulled off in the ring.  The Rumble in the Jungle only requires two pages; Frazier flipping out in a hotel room and the minute psychological motives behind that, however, requires half the book.  Hmmm.    Actually, you can tell Kram hates both of them.  Frazier less, because he uses him as scrap metal to throw at Ali.  In his painful state of cynicism and hatred for self and others, Kram spares neither fighter; he doesn't even spare Archie Moore or Sugar Ray, painting nightmare visions of them as permanently brain damaged, staring into outer space.  Sonny Liston's death from a drug overdose is a source of voyeuristic pleasure for Mark, making sure we know that no one wept for him.  He writes, more or less, like they deserve what they got.      As if all this weren't enough, Kram even uses deliberate distortion.  He claims that the "phantom punch", which again and again has been proven to have connected with Liston's head, never happened.  "Only those interested in maintaining Ali's legend will ever invest in the phantom punch".  For a boxing journalist, Kram sure has missed a lot.  In the end, both disintegrate.  Frazier and Ali are irreedemable messes to Kram, products of the "disgusting sport" he's made his living off of.  And guess what, Joe's still obsessed with Ali and how he beat him up twice!  In Kram's mind, this pettiness is worthy of a depiction by Van Gogh.   I am sorry, but there is something wrong with Mark Kram.  This should be next to William Styron's "Darkness Visible" as a testimony of what mental illness can do to a man.  I wouldn't recommend it, though, as book about the Greatest of All Time or his worthiest opponent.         
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 I knocked this CD down to 2 stars because of the song, "Lovelite".  It would not hurt the record label to put the full version of this O'Bryan hit on the CD.  I struggle to understand why labels don't put the full version of songs on greatest hit CDs.  With other viewers saying other O'Bryan jams missing from this CD, this CD should get a low rating.  But unfortunately, since this is the only greatest hit CD out by O'Bryan and it's been almost 10 years, you may have no choice to purchase this incomplete CD 
 I will be returning this item to the vendor.  I rec'd. this skirt for my daughter and thought it had a colorful embroidery.  Instead I find the word BASKE in a mirrored embroidered image.  Not sure what BASKE stands for.  I guess it's their idea of 'short for Basketball'.  WHATEVER!  You can't see the pic clearly.  I'm out the shipping cost on this one.  What a bummer! 
 I just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the C743 camera.  The battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger.  I think it's odd, as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock.  I'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery.  I don't know whether the dock works okay, because I didn't get that far.  This is my second easyshare camera and dock and I was very happy with the first one.  Now I have to buy another battery 
 Just because Kali's Child won AAR award some people seem to believe it passed the test of academic vigor. This is akin to saying since Enron hired third party accountants their accounting books are not cooked. We now know better. Atleast Enron hired third party, no such pretense is made in case of Indology. Jeffrey Kripal's Knowledge of Bengali is suspect, so is his scholarship. He is yet to accept a debate in Bengali language in an open forum speaks reams about his proficiency. There has been a scholarly rebuttal to Kripal at http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/s_rv/s_rv_tyaga_kali1_frameset.htm. However Kripal declined to include Tyagananda's rebuttal in newer versions of the book. All this says more about state of Indology studies & Kripal than the later has to say about Ramakrishna 
 I bought this book at a time when I was looking for source materials on native american culture and living for the non native american person. The book came reccomended to me by a friend who owned it with a word of caution that it was just alright. I went out and bought it, read through it and found it ok in some places and questionable in others. The author does advertise her other "for sale" services quite a bit which gets a little daunting, however there are some chapters which are well written and full of imagery. The two I liked best were her chapter on crystals where she describes a gift giving ceremony between her and friends, something which I have enjoyed doing myself. I also liked the part onbuilding your own personal altar, unlike other new age authors who proclaim altar set ups and endless tools, the author of this book tells readers to have an empty altar, perhaps covered in a sacred cloth which can be a simple focal point rather than a holder of all sorts of tools. All in all If you want this book then buy it used, use those parts of it that speak to you and discard the rest. Incidently, there is a picture of the author in the back of the book and looking at her I couldnt help but feel a bit uneasy, she dosent present a very spiritual image 
 Too much wrong information in the text. Photo captions = hit or miss.  Altogether: unreliable. Take your needs elsewhere 
 I just can't figure Beck out -- This album offers very little entertainment. You could always count on Beck for something different each time out--- but not with this album. The songs sound like tunes that were from previous sessions and just left of off earlier albums. Not his best, as the Amazon review states 
 The Corporation will find any way it can to squeeze more cash out of any platinum "artist". Jewel was a perfect candidate with her bloated, exaggerated tales of growing up in a van in Alaska and pure angelic features. Why would anyone think that a singer with lyrics like, "my hands are small, I know, but they're not yours, they are my own," can write anything that even remotely resembles decent prose? Her poems are nothing more than scattered, broken phrases that are, at worst, unbelievably incoherrent and at best, prime kindergarten-like tales of unrequited love and child-like observation. It's a hard cold fact that the only reason she was allowed to publish such trite poetry is solely because of her platinum cd sales. Anyone who believes that this stuff is good, must either be a loyal follower or the most basic of amatuer readers of prose, and must be taken to the nearest library immediately for an emergency infusion of Frost, Yates or Angelou. You would find more artistic merit in a car manual then Jewel's laughable prose.      
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 I purchased this movie without reading the reviews, based only on my fondness for older movies and the other movies I've seen the two main stars in. This movie was awful, and the sad part is, there were sooooo many opportunities to save the movie all throughout.  The acting was obviously overdone on purpose, I just wish I knew why - it didn't come off as funny or as a satire if that was the intent.  In the end - I threw out the DVD so as not to accidently subject someone else to it 
 The last Star Wars novel I read that was based on a video game was the excellent "Republic Commando: Hard Contact" by Karen Traviss.  I had hopes that "The Ruins of Dantooine" could be nearly as good as the Traviss novel, but it wasn't to be.  "The Ruins of Dantooine" felt somewhat like a video game and it just wasn't very good.  The story was fairly simple and quest orientated and wasn't nearly as engaging as it could have been.    The Empire learns that a Rebel Holocron has been left on the planet Dantooine.  The holocron contains a full list of all of the Rebel Alliance spies within the Empire.  If it falls into the hands of the Empire it could effectively crush the ability of the Rebellion to operate.  Everything would be compromised.  The Empire sends one of their spies to recover the holocron.  The Alliance sends Finn Darktrin to locate the holocron before the Empire finds it.  An Empire biologist, Dusque Mistflier, somehow gets mixed up into the search for the holocron and assists Finn as Dusque becomes more and more disillusioned with the realities of the Empire.    This book just wasn't very interesting.  The story itself is quite basic and followed a video game structure with missions and a boss battle.  While the chance to explore Dantooine, and a post Prequel Trilogy Naboo was potentially interesting, the overall experience was weak and lacking.  The one good thing here is that there is no need to have played the game to understand the story, but I can only hope that the game was better than this book.  It was a nice effort, but the only reason to read this book is to read every Star Wars book published.  That's about it.    -Joe Sherr 
 Europe is bad, America is good, Number One , best of the world, uniquely great...Well, that is all there is to it here. This book is a constant insult to the intelligence of the reader, whether he be conservative or liberal, given the absurd violence and anger of the tone. Interestingly enough however, as others have pointed out, Rabkin's true haunting fear is not about the European Union, but rather American progressives willing to claim American ideals for the cause of peace and justice 
 I am newly preg too. I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. I can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. Ha ha ha...  Last night, I'm reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. I would just not be near them while they smoke. Period. She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesn't work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesn't work try being nice. I don't know many smokers but I don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a LONG TIME! (Implied: OR Ever!) I take pride in keeping myself fit. I am a little freaked about the weight issue. I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me. Even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife. 
 Make no mistake that Outsiders and Green Arrow scribe Judd Winick is a talented writer, although for some his run on Batman would be a cause for some to think otherwise.  For well over a decade now the character of Jason Todd, AKA the Robin that was voted dead by readers, has been dead and remained so; a feat that is impressive for a comic book character.  Now, enter this TPB, where the long dead Jason Todd has returned from the dead, and if you're looking for a reason why (other than maybe Winick ran out of ideas) you won't find it here.  The storyline picks up with Black Mask as the undisputed crime lord of Gotham City, until the mysterious Red Hood enters the game and causes problems for both Batman and Black Mask.  Eventually it's revealed that it's Jason Todd "under the hood" (heh, heh) and back from the dead to oppose the Dark Knight, and also in the jumbled story is Mr. Freeze and a couple hundred pounds of Kryptonite.  Besides Todd being resurrected, the story itself is lacking, and the dialogue and action are some of the worst Winick has scripted.  The art does it's job for the most part, but it doesn't save the story.  It's a shame that characters that have been dead in comics for so long, like Todd and recently Bucky in Marvel's Captain America, are being brought back from the dead all of the sudden after a few years of a sort of comic renaissance, but we all knew that one day this would be bound to happen.  Give it a look if you're a Batfan, but other than that leave this on the shelf 
 Assuming I'm not mistaking this book for a different "way of the warrior", I must say that this book teaches dirty fighting alone 
 After reading the fine book "Bad Astronomy," I found "Bad Medicine" a disappointment. The tortured puns in the astronomy book made me wince, but it was written by an astronomer and was authoritative and educational. By contrast, this uninformative book on medicine was written not by a physician or Ph.D. researcher but by Christopher Wanjek, a writer whose bio offers no academic credentials but highlights that he is a Saturday Night Live joke writer. Ironically, he takes people to task for believing pseudoscience from questionable sources. Yet we're given no cause to think Wanjek is a credible source himself, and while he does quote authorities from time to time, he does not routinely back up his claims with expert testimony.  This is not to say that the content of the book is wholly incorrect. On the contrary, much of it is sensible. But I learned almost nothing. It is not exactly big news that a lot of herbal remedies have yet to be subjected to rigorous testing, or that homeopathy is based on an idiotic premise. Does the author really think the people who are likely to read this book don't know that? The majority of his exposes are obvious to everyone but National Enquirer devotees.  Even the chapters that didn't cover the excruciatingly obvious were lacking. For example, I found his chapter on milk not being the healthy drink it is cracked up to be somewhat thought-provoking. However, his glib advice is "drink calcium-fortified orange juice." OJ is loaded with sugar, so it seems unlikely to be a healthy alternative when consumed in large quantity. And, since I don't reside in the U.S., I can't get the calcium fortification anyway. Besides, his concerns over hormones in milk are hard to take seriously, when in other chapters he takes people to task for being concerned about trace amounts of dioxin and other toxins.   Finally, I found at least one outright error, along with other statements that struck me as wrong, although as a non-scientist I can't be sure. Wanjek states that the Atkins diet does not allow you to eat asparagus. Whatever you think of Atkins, that's just plain WRONG. Atkins actually encourages people to eat lots of green vegetables, asparagus specifically included.  Another example: several years ago, I was treated by an ophthalmologist who teaches at Harvard Medical School. Unlike Wanjek, I'm not willing to make blanket statements about areas that lie outside my expertise, so perhaps I'm mistaken, but it seems to me my eye doctor told me things that directly contradict what Wanjek says in chapter 3.  If there were some indication that each chapter had been reviewed by the appropriate specialist, perhaps I wouldn't doubt Wanjek so much. But I saw no indication that the book has been fact-checked by real live physicians.  In closing, it is only fair to say that Wanjek is a terrific writer. As disgusted as I was by the lack of intellectual rigor in this book, I would have stopped reading if he didn't have such an engaging style. The history of medical practice that he opens with makes great reading, and his chapters that point out how falsely Hollywood portrays the consequences of regular exposure to gunfire and repeated knocks on the head are very entertaining. I can see why he's had success as a comic writer - he is laugh-out-loud funny in spots. But medicine is no joke. Wanjek and his publishers at Wiley should have treated the subject more seriously.   
 This book may be a good book sometime ago. I find the chapters now needs an update. the code discussed in the book not working now. The CD has got only old code and software 
 I've been in the customer service field for 15 years, and this is, hands down, the worst customer service book I've ever read!  The techniques listed are truly awful. In every situation I put myself in the customer's position and if the person helping me followed these techniques - I would quickly become an angry customer or insulted and never visit that establishment again. The author lists the exact wrong things to do to provide good customer service, yet he presents them as good techniques and the right thing to do.  Awful! I think Mr. Bascal didn't pay attention to the title of his book - it is NOT entitled "Perfect Ways to Enrage Your Customers."      The first part of the book the author labors on and on about how "allegedly" great his book is and then proceeds to take 15 pages to explain the set up of his book - which could be done in two or three sentences.  He then outlines his very bad techniques in the second section, and the third section he gives examples of how to put these outrageous techniques in to action.    Whatever you do, do NOT buy this book.  And most importantly, do not let your employees read this book!!!  I would hate to see anyone putting these stupid and customer enraging/insulting tecniques in to practice.  
 having seen the most shocking of horror films that relish in the grotesque and stay in our minds like a stain on our brain and enjoyed them i began to watch this film with a sceptical eye. having watched 10 minutes of the film i ejected the dvd that it had been burned onto and smashed it convinced that if the devil does exist then he exists purely in this film. do not watch this film. it exploits everything that is wrong with humanity and leaves a taste in your mouth that you can never rid yourself of. the only positive thing that i have to say about this film is that after watching it and finding myself sicked and deeply disturbed i know that in one way or another that i must be a good person. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!! 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 I bought this radio 2 years ago. My worst 80 dollars. It is pratically impossible to get 1 short wave station. I have tried everything. Nothing, nada. Also the slide for the volume is terrible. You can't control the volume. They should remove this radio from the market, or at least remove the short wave reception, since you can't hear nothing 
 Philosophical musing of hard core materialistic reductionist, incapable of open-mindedness to overcome blindness of shortsighted old-paradigm scientific dogmas, thus incapable to see a revolutionary "big picture", which is offered by cutting-edge scientific discoveries of our days in the fields of quantum physics, epigenetics, neurobiology, neurosociology, social and emotional intelligence, etc., etc., etc. This book gives no articulated, nor substantiated answer to the question it claims to give, just contributes to mental confusion and emotional illiteracy. Enlightenment is something the author would NEVER enjoy... Waisted time and money for those readers, who could sense the historical merger of all scientific disciplines and ancient wisdom we are witnessing now. 
 "Cyrano" is one of the greatest verse plays ever written.    Unfortunately Gerard Depardieu is no Cyrano.  He's a great, clumsy side of beef, not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of Hercule Sevanien Cyrano de Bergerac.  With the best will in the world, his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance.  The English translation was especially commissioned for this film.  It is undistinguished, prosy and dull.  It has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great American actor Walter Passmore.  Get the Jose Ferrer version.  This one's a dog 
 What a "piece of work" this was.  Boring, slow, full of highly irrelevant side plots... just a bomb NOT "the bomb" ;).  It took me forever to finish it because I would literally start falling asleep after a few pages and this is something that I very rarely experience.  There are like 5 or 6 parallel stories in this book which none come to any level of satisfactory fruition at the end of the book.  Save your money and more importanly your TIME... skip to something else if you come across this one 
 I didn't like these series of dvd's. If you are the kind of person who likes the basic jump up and down exercises, then this is not for you. I found it hard to get into the moves. For maybe ten minutes I stood there rewinding and pausing so I could get the moves down. I've tried other FIRM tapes and I have realized that I don't really like their aerobic workouts they are to hard to follow.The sculpting tapes I can live with. My boyfriend saw me trying to workout to the tapes and he couldn't stop laughing at me. I looked like a I had no rhythm. I didn't recommend this to my friends so I will do the same for you 
 If you can use the internet,and more specifically a search engine,theres nothing in this book helpful.Find a few good resellers online,ones with reveiws and product links,and you not only get quick knowledge but save alot of time and money 
 I have all of the 4 major sports books of the Total package.These stats were increddibally incomplete like they show no tackles stats. I know tackles are not an official stat but there are sources like with the Negro leagues in baseball that show the stats. I liked the part about the Top 300 players to 1998. The Draft had all of the picks but I wish they would have who the top players were in each draft like the hockey one. I thought this book was okay it had some good stats but is no where near Hockey-Baseball-Basketball versions 
 I found this book at a thrift store for 25 cents. I flipped though it and it looked dated, but interesting, so I decided to get it.  As other reviewers mention, it is dated -- but you gotta know that up front when you get it. It's published in 1986, when there were no (well, almost no) home computers. So you have to accept up front that it's talking about organizing papers using more papers -- but that's something we still all got to do occasionally.  So it's a system of notepads, file folders, etc. It does help you try to understand why you want to keep papers, etc, and what you can do about it. However, it does get overly complex, and really doesn't seem applicable in today's world, where there are far fewer "homemakers" who spend time organizing sewing and recipe files, as this book seems to be focused on.  Finally, I have to mention that it was the continual religion-related references that put me off to the book in the end. Others who are comfortable with this may not even notice it, but for me, I felt I was being preached to a bit too much to find it tolerable. Just my personal taste; I'm sure some others will disagree with this judgement, but I have to admit after enough casual religion references tossed randomly throughout the text, I gave up on the book and put it in the recycle bin 
 An incredibly jargon-laden work. Sadly, many of the contributors really have nothing to say and spend a long time not saying it. On a few occasions, however, some of the contributions really shine and remind one that not all of academia is populated by mediocrity 
 I just received the book "Exhibition Design" today from Amazon.  I was very excited to find the title because there are so few books on the subject of museum exhibition design.  I was however very disappointed with the overall quality of the book. I have other W. W. Norton books ( Building the Empire State) and I own close to 300 architecture and design books.  I have never been so shocked at the poor quality of the photography in any of my books. Some of the photos in Exhibition Design book were not sharp....some where so dark you could not tell what was really going on in the exhibit...but most seem like they were photographed with a camera phone.  I was even shocked at the poor picture resolution of the Ralph Applebaum exhibits (blurry non sharp pictures and poorly lit)... I have a couple of books that cover the same projects and the photos in those books are wonderful...I assumed that companies like Applebaum send out a specific press kit with professional photographs.  I guess I have learned that I should always see a design book in person before buying it on line 
 This hardcore conservative did not enjoy this book.  The book is filled with a wealth of eye-opening information on significant people that I did not know but should (like Hugo Chavez's new best friend, Noam Chomsky), but the reading is so laborious and draining that I cannot recommend it.  It has none of the light-hearted fun that we often get from Rush Limbaugh.  Rather, it brought to mind the dark experience of listening alone to Michael Savage in a bad mood after dark.  The cheeky title is misleading - this was a joyless book to read 
 What a world we live in where propaganda is no longer used to support governnments but corporations. After 30 minutes of this tripe I felt ill. Any serious person with an understanding of democracy and modern business practice will reject this heavy handed corporate propaganda 
 This book makes the most grievous error a book can make: it's boring.  The title sounded intriguing, but the book is a real snooze.  I skipped page after page looking for something of interest to read.  Alas, I found nothing.  Talk about disappointment.  I was hoping for a scathing analysis of the degradation of language in contemporary discourse and music.  What I got was...well, I'm not sure but it put me to sleep within 5 minutes.  I don't want to read in-depth analyses of speeches from 1856 or whatever.  Maybe there's another book out there that discusses the devaluation of language in pop culture in a compelling way.  This one ain't...I mean, isn't, it 
 The parts of this set are not well made - light, flimsy plastic. The highlight of the set, the battery-operated hairdryer, worked for a few seconds and then never again, even with fresh batteries - I suspect due to poor connection. The cover for the battery compartment was badly made and didn't sit well. The rest of the items included are nothing to write home about either. I bought this for a Christmas present for my dd and sent it back for a refund 
 Crappy.  The sound was horrible and put together shabbily.  Also, the discs are not even CLOSED CAPTIONED!!!  Too pricey for a product that doesn't deliver 
 I had the Lonely Planet and my friend had the Rough guide and the difference was quite great.  The section on the Mekong Delta for example was vastly more in depth in the LP and I would have been totally lost if I had used the Rough Guide 
 ... The "collage of voices" approach endemic to oral history leads in this case to a frustrating, almost indigestible mess. Dave Marsh warns in his editor's note to the For The Record series of which this volume is a part, "if an artist isn't especially interested in what happens in the recording studio but has a fascination with what happens in hotel rooms after live gigs, that's what you'll get." So, instead of getting more than the barest glimpse inside the studio during the recording of There's A Riot Going On, surely one of the deepest albums in all of American popular music history, we are given page after page devoted to the band's sex lives, taste in drugs, and even their surprising if unilluminating avocation as collective dog fanciers (really!). What's missing, literally, is Sly's voice, which leaves a gaping hole in the center of the narrative. By connecting the dots one can glean a few insights about the music from the mass of bleary anecdotes herein, but aren't authors and editors supposed to do that for you? If you're in the market for a mess of depressing gossip, this will be your meat; if you're seeking insight into the man's (and the group's) brilliant music, look elsewhere 
 I'm sorry, but some of the samples in this book just scare me. The two zombie children have shown up in my nightmares even.  I suppose that some of the techniques will take me in the direction I want to go, but I'm praying that I will have better results than the author.  If you are looking for those amazing money making techniques that highend studios are using today, look elsewhere.  This is not the book for you and me 
 I'm a big fan of her other works, but this one was so fragmented and uninspired that I quit without finishing.  Life is too short to waste time reading bad books 
 Robert Wiene's "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is a celebrated work of German Expressionism.  While there are several interesting facets to it, this grand experiment in filmmaking cannot be regarded as a complete success.  Francis (Friedrich Feher) relays a strange story.  A man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) once came to his town seeking a permit to display an exhibit at a carnival.  The exhibit was a wooden cabinet that housed a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt).  Strange happenings then ensued after Cesare predicted the death of one of Francis's friends.  Concerned for the safety of his beloved Jane (Lil Dagover), Francis took it upon himself to determine whether Caligari was the person responsible for the disturbing series of events.  In a strange way, one can look upon "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" as a bizarre version of "The Wizard of Oz" (1939).  The framing sequences are similar and the surreal appearance of the town effectively creates an unfamiliar world that has its own unique and distinct visual identity.  Yet, despite the ample creativity on display and the intriguing ideas the film explores in regards to memory and interpretation, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is stiff and dreary.  The characters are not engaging and the story is just a generic murder mystery with a monster thrown in.  Give "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" points for trying to do something different and for influencing the look and feel of horror films that followed, but feel free to skip it if you are not a fan of the peculiar.   
 It just astonished me as how certain discursive formations can actually lead people to believe as the 'real' reality. It does not matter whether for an event to 'really happen' or not. What matters is that you hear it on a radio or read it on a newspaper or website or even talk about it at the water-cooler. Those who have had the chance to watch 'Wag the Dog' might get the idea of how such 'reality' is constructed.  On a more advanced level 'discursivity', a la Foucault, is a building block of a discourse in which certain linkages, here and their, add to what ordinary people believe on the street.  Now obviously Hitler was one of the worst things that happened during the 20th century. This is commonsense. But to add certain 'material' so as to advance another claim by building upon Hitler, is something that should be carefully approached, at least for people who at least visit and read stuff through Amazon. If a chain in a series of discursive formations can be shown to be weak or invalid than it would be proven that that chain of a discourse is on shaky grounds, and that most of what is known about it is likely to be false. Unfortunately we see certain 'material' is attached to certain claims so as to resemble the Holocaust. Let us revisit a single claim on part of those would like to exploit the events during the early 20th century. A reviewer, for instance, obviously bought one claim and thus knows it to be the 'truth'  Adolf Hitler: "Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?"  Now has anybody bothered to investigate it. No, of course. "It sounds like as if it is true, so why not believe it". Well fortunately there are still people who like investigating such stuff. Read for example : Heath W. Lowry Washington, D.C. Political Communication and Persuasion, Volume 3, Number 2 (1985) Abstract This article traces the history of a purported Adolf Hitler quote which cites the perecent of the world's lack of reaction to the fate of Armenians during the First World War as a justification for his planned extermination of European Jewry in the course of the Second World War. By a detailed examination of the genesis of this quotation the author demonstrates that there is no historical basis for attributing such a statement to Hitler... [...] If one is serious about really getting into history, rather than believing simply what is out their in the popular press, I would additionally suggest to take a tour of the documents of Ambassador Morgenthau. First let us not take any word for having a Godly truth 'Its ambassador so its gotta be true' mentality is ok if you're ok with it (respect of thought). But there are historical evidence that suggests that Morgenthau did not even know Ottoman scripture, and that this is proved throughout his letters when he attempts to translate 'words' and 'dates' of events. Do not hesitate to read... [...]   For those who have CAREFULLY read what I have written so far, notice I am not either on one side of the argument between Armenian historians or historians of the Ottoman empire, but that I have just thrown out some thought provoking information so that one will at least ask some questions before believing what they read. Doubtless there will be those occasional pointless replies to this review, but again all I am saying is, think before you react. Now one could argue that I am saying is a postmodernist crituque and historical relativism. That would be false. I believe in historical analysis, as a scientific enterprise (and only the scientific version of it). But then again let us not forget that some American historians who were studying the case at hand were bombed by Armenians. Now if history is written by historians and that some historians (i.e. UCLA professor Stanford Shaw)are bullied so as not to investigate certain historical matters than, at least if you have a capacity to think critically than be suspicious about it. [...] By the way absolutely nothing is mentioned about the equal ammount of civilian Turks that were slaugthered by Russian backed Armenian militia. Nor anything about the terrorism campaign of Armenians during the 1970's that left thousands of people dead and wounded. To say "denying genocide is a wrong thing" is one thing. But in doing so if one is denying the death of tens of thousands of innocent Turks, is called hypocrism and puts one in ethically shaky grounds.    The latest British governemeents acceptance that the "blue book", which Armenian claims are based upon, have been declared by the government itself to be a WW1 time propaganda material. Yes you heard it right!  Here's another eye opener: Often the claim is made there 1 million Armenians were murdered. What they do not say that the same material they indicate that a "genocide" happened says that  the ENTIRE Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire was 800 thousand (200 thousand difference!) MOREOVER Keep in mind that the Armenian diaspora, that builds its own desire to have a national identity, has a population of more than 9 million people across the world. HOW CAN this be??? Well thats how nationalism is formed: impossibile numbers, man on white horse, the evil "other" etc.... So this "genocide" attitude is more of identity building rather than real history.     Well I hope I contributed on an intellectual level and I hope 'thought thugs' would not misunderstand what I have suggested.

 Although I am definitely on the 'Sonicare' bandwagon in so far as this product's ability to clean my teeth--it does a great job--this model brush is made quite poorly.   The battery compartment (the e3000 uses 'AA' batteries) on mine, regardless of it having an o-ring on the door, seems to be continually wet inside, with the negative (-) terminal on one of the AA-cells rusting after only two weeks use. Philips acknowledges this is a problem but offers no solution.  Also, there are many small crevices in/around the nameplate on the side, and a large gap under the nut for the brush-head that accumulates 'gook' on a daily basis. Philips advises that this is probably 'mold' and the brush should be 'disassembled and air-dried' after every use. It takes longer to do this than to brush my teeth--  Again, while this is probably one of the best ways to clean your teeth at this point in time, and an economical way to try one of the products that normally start out at $64e (and up), there is no reason why the e3000 shouldn't be made as well as the better units, or hold up to water/daily use as well as some of the $9 Crest electrics we commonly see 
 I'll be succinct.  Don't waste your money buying this book.  Don't waste your time reading it.  This is a smart-alec's attempt at humor.  It betrays his deep-ingrained English bigotry towards the Irish and Catholics 
 Maybe the worst "thriller" I've read in years. The dialogue, characters and plot are at best soap opera material and that's giving it a positive spin. I hope Mr. Hosp is a good lawyer....and we all know what Wm. Shakespeare said about that profession 
 I did not feel this book at all. It falls so flat--everything might as well be a cardboard cut-out--that it's hilarious the main character is a celebrated writer. The structure of the story should work: a man living off his waning fame as the author of a celebrated novel leaves his prominence, and his leeching girlfriend, for a small village in France, hoping to recapture his inspiration and find some answers about his past.   Harris fails to deliver in all respects. The novel reads like a first draft, and I wish she'd realized her mistake and threw the manuscript in the fireplace. In light of character Jay's decision at the end and how it must reflect on Harris, you wonder why she even bothered in the first place. With Jay, Harris barely manages to creat a character more talented and wise than she is.   Absolutely terrible. Extra star for sustained effort 
 The monographs lack any sort of scientific references.  A true reference manual should list references so the reader can verify the conclusions made 
 A Very disappointed read! I grew up in NYC (Manhattan) and had heard about the 500 Club from my Father, friends and relatives. This book did not do it justice. I could not even stay focused on this it was soooooo boring at times. Unlike Atlantic City should have been in those times. To give the book some credit there were a few interesting tidbits about Joe Di Maggio, Toots Shor, and Sinatra and Crew! It was nothing I could not have learned watching Biography

 I've never had such-a-slap in the face biased book presented to me for college curriculum. Very dissapointing 
 ...and was left putting the book down every two seconds because I was annoyed by it. It is not marvelously written; in fact, I found myself correcting his sentence structure and grammar in at least every other paragraph, if not more (editor, please?). It's an interesting enough plot, but the way it's put forth is mindnumbing. The non-fiction information he put in there could have been ten times more interesting in two ways. First, if the information had been summarized in about two pages. And second, if he hadn't pretended like everyone reading this book was in the second grade and had minimal comprehension abilities.   I'm usually a fast reader, but this book (a quick 415-page paperback read) took me more than a month, just because I had to keep putting it down. If you simply want something to "frighten" you, or are unusually interested with autopsies (there are about five million in the book), and don't care about poor writing, pick this book up 
 This is strictly my opinion, thus it is not empirically verifiable, but I found this book to be extremely disappointing! To me, it seemed as if the authors of this book wrote it the night before it was due to the editors. Until I had read a few other books on Flash 5, I thought it was me. The book takes you through a tutorial on updating a flash movie, say "megansdiary_start.swf," and your updated flash movie should come out exactly like the author's included final flash movie for that tutorial, "megansdiary_final.swf." However, there are lines of syntax that the tutorials fail to mention need to be added to the *_start.swf in order for it to come out like the *_final.swf. Also, what the authors tell you to input into ActionScript for your *_start.swf differs from what they have input in their *_final.swf, not only in location, but in content as well. They might make the claim that I read the book wrong, but that's only because the authors are catering to themselves as readers, not as an intermediate, or let alone a beginner in Flash 5. If I were one of those authors, I would ask for all copies to be recalled to update it in an edited version or I would ask for all copies to just be recalled giving a refund, to avoid future embarassment. I can't believe I wasted [my money] on this book. Oh well, it has neat pictures 
 This book is interesting if you are just looking for name that sound different, but don't believe in what the author wrote.  As a French person, I had to have a look at the french section. I was really surprise to find names that were either not french at all or don't exist at all (like "beau", which is the french term for pretty or nice, but is not a name... please don't call your child "beau", it would make any French or french speaking person laugh!)  I have no way to know whether the rest of the book was writen the same way, but how could I trust it now 
 My husband and I tried using this book and it's methods for almost a year with not even a hint at conception. The author's "frank" opinion about trying to conceive after 35 is negative and discouraging. I refused to believe that I was infertile but because I am over 35, it was very difficult to determine my fertile window using these methods. It caused undo stress and anxiety and my husband and I finally broke down and spent the money to purchase an OVwatch. We conceived the first time using the watch. I am not trying to plug them for any reason other than it works. We conceived twice using the watch after a year of frustration and depression. They are the most decent, supportive, positive customer service oriented company I have ever encountered. I found Terri Weshcler to be incredibly negative and judgemental of women trying to conceive at a later age-and the last thing you need is another seed of negativity when you're trying to conceive 
 I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE DRESSED UP AS HOT DOGS AND THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH STAR JONES AND MARV ALBERT. (... 
 I can't believe they published this.  The book must have been writted on cocktail napkins before being printed.  Chapters are just tossed together, skipping some of the necessary information for the 70-271 exam.  Review questions are asked 2 chapters before they are covered. Looking at MS objectives, which Bill forgot to do,the exam covers both Professional and Home versions.  The book lacked the information dealing with XP home. The 70-272 section of the book followed the same screwy format of the first. The book is good for genereal reference but not good enough to for a study guide. 
 After reading other reviews, I expected an erudite, flowing novel which would connect multiple worlds.  What I discovered was a complicated plot that does not make it easy for the reader to understand.  I do believe that if writing is too difficult to comprehend, then is not clear writing, and I wonder if the author really knows if she is presenting a ghost or love story of both.  If it is both, it is confusing to me.  The action is wrapped around two cousins, one successul and the victim of a childhood prank of the other loser adult cousin.  We are transported to a castle near Prague where we imagine the successful cousin will finally have retribution, Egan spins a tale of blood lore based on family pride.  From this narrative, she shifts to a maximum security prison where the characters are similar to the castle folk.  The creative writing teacher, Holly, becomes a main character, who has her own demons and finds a commonaility with a prisoner who is the same, we are to believe, as the loser cousin.  She does prove that escape is impossible, and I wish I could have found some sanctuary if I understood what she really wanted to tell us 
 This book was utterly boring. It is a cutesy attempt at satire, only the entire time, I kept thinking, "Edith Wharton did it better." The problem with Lewis's version of what a satire is is that satire is supposed to be subtle; outright criticism of the characters and lifestyles is almost insulting to the reader's intellect.  The other issue I have with Babbitt is its long-winding lead-up, unsatisfying climax, and disappointing denouement. The plot took too long to manifest itself, and this was largely due to Lewis's incisions of "clever" critique into the narrative.   As a short story, this novel would've worked out brilliantly. However, spanning three hundred pages as it is, it's a long, drab waste of time 
 This study guide gives an idea of the type of questions that are on the TEA exam, but it does not give an accurate picture of the difficulty of the questions on the exam.  This study guide makes you think that you are ready for the exam when you are not.  I recommend getting ARCO's Special Agent Deputy U.S. Marshall study guide 
 I really liked Joust unexpectedly, and so I decided to borrow this book as well. I'm about 2/3 finished up to this book and would like to comment on it already. I WANT to like this book, I really do. In fact, sometimes I forget my misgivings and enjoy some of the parts.  The problem is, it's not just up to the same quality that Joust had. Explanations of the dragons and theories on their training was well enough in Joust, but it continues on to here, which is tedious to say the least, and sometimes I felt like throwing the book against the wall and shouting, "I KNOW already! I know about that falcon crap! Get with the story!" There was too much explanation of unecessary things, such as harness colours and God-knows-what-else. It's even worse that all of these things seem to push the actual story and events and make it really simple...I read Joust and thought, "That was good. Now the next part, where Kiron and Avatre have their adventure, should be better." And then my reaction when I found how easy things were became, "Eh?" I wanted a story, not a...diary of sorts.  But the worse part is I feel this book wasn't edited, not by the editors, not by the author herself. I found so many parts that reminded me of amateurish writing, which is ridiculous because I know this book was written by someone with a lot of novels under her belt! For example, there was a part where Kiron thought along the lines of, "The dragonest would be born amidst thunder and rain like Avatre. That was a good omen." And then he says the EXACT same thing a few sentences down. A lot of this 'information repeats' happens so many times it's difficult to ignore. There were too many explanations of obvious things. One of the dragon's names changes from Bethlan to Bethulan over several times in the book. Many sentences were awkward, something akin to: "It was the same man Kiron had met earlier, but he looked so different he would not have been able to tell it was the same man." I also found a LOT of sentences with words that don't make sense, or were lacking words, as if the author wrote them while half-asleep, and never looked at them again. That alone distracted me and frustrated me to a point where I never wanted to trust the author again...  If you liked Joust, you should read this book anyway, just to know what happens to Kiron, but don't expect too much. I hope the third one doesn't AT LEAST have the errors this one has. 
 This book has a good idea, but some of the interpretation is not right. As I have heard before... the best interpretation is no interpretation. Although I think that this book has a great layout of learning Biblical Principles, it has questionable content that I would not recommend to others. This book has become very popular among people in our country, but it is important to remember that we need to look at what the Bible says, not simply take the interpretation of scripture from others 
 This would be the LAST place I would send someone to get a taste of Al Franken. The first half of the book makes the same jokes over and over and over and over again, and throughout, you really need to know a lot of Washington inside stuff to get the jokes. In some ways a sharp expose of our political and media system, and in other ways far, far, far too long with the general feel of a train wreck 
 One wonders how a corporare board would react when the disccovered that Jesus-CEO had put Mark 10:21 into effect as a corporate policy.  Really, this has to be the dumbest title in history. 
   Great book, of course, but for this edition Oxford used a computer to justify the  type. On every other line you encounter three or four spaces   where there should be  only one. It may not bother most readers, but I'm looking for another    publisher's edition 
 I've hardly ever been in a Wal-Mart.  Despite not liking to shop at Wal-Mart myself I don't have any stronger feelings against them than against other "big box" stores such as Home Depot, Target, K-Mart or Lowe's.  As far as I'm concerned they're all temples of materialism that blight the landscape and cause traffic jams.  So what's wrong with Wal-Mart in particular?  Bill Quinn, the curmudgeon author of this blog-like diatribe, relies on unnamed sources, data (some of it improbable) without references and lots of anecdotes that may or may not be true.  His redundant message is that the Bentonville blankety-blanks, as he repeatedly refers to Wal-Mart, possesses the (in)human characteristics of "evil" and "greed" and manages, apparently thorough some satanic process, to violate the laws of economics and simultaneously treat all employees, vendors AND customers like dirt and single handedly destroy small town America's utopia-like "mom and pop" main street commerce (whatever that meant in the 1990s after decades of Sears, K-Mart, etc.).  But every so-called shady or dirty tactic the author singles out to revile Wal-Mart with is practiced in some form by all aggressive, professional retailers.  And do so-called "mom and pop" stores always provide health insurance and pay more than minimum wage?  Hardly.  And if vendors and service suppliers lose money selling to Wal-Mart then 1) why did they sign the deal and 2) why are they selling to Wal-Mart more than once?  These complaints make no sense.  Quinn's suggestions for "fighting" Wal-Mart range from common sense (storekeepers update your business skills) to ineffective (letters to the editor) to improbable (running for political office).  This moonbat even suggests such retro-60s touches as forming a protest to chant (I'm not kidding here) "one, two, three, four, we don't want your lousy store."  Quinn is a fanatic.  He sums up by writing, "The long and the short of it for me is, I hate Wal-Mart."  And that, in essence, is all he says in 171 pages with lots of white space that reads like it was written over a long weekend and is six years out of date.  If you're a Wal-Mart hater you might enjoy this.  Otherwise save your money and fight Wal-Mart by spending the same amount on something fun at a "mom and pop" store.  Or from Wal-Mart or an Internet retailer, whichever you like, because in America we're not only free to say what we want but we're free to shop where we want.  No index, no references for many key assertions, no new information since 1999.  
 This book's findings are pure fantasy and have been repudiated by the work of Norman Finkelstein.  Bard's a biased author to start with AND claiming the Palestinians are not native to the land even though they speak a unique Southern Levantine dialect is patently absurd.  Not recommended either for its simplicity or deliberate duplicity.  Take a college course or use the web for comparative information.  Otherwise, getting your info. from Bard will have left you as clueless about the region as before 
 I recently bought this for my son's birthday.  I went ahead and let my 5 yr old and his friends open this gift at the party.  It really was just like playing with barely damp sand.  It would clump together, but not very well.  The kids had a great time but there wasnt a place that this sand didnt get into.  It was stuck in shoes, in the cracks of the dresser, it got in food, it got in other toys.  It literaly was everywhere!  I wish you guys could see the carpet.  I felt so bad for the people cleaning up after us that I left a bigger tip then i would have.  Some parents even warned their friends on the phone to never buy this stuff.  My poor kiddo was kind of upset when i wouldn't let him bring it home.  Thanks for nothing.  Every parent in the group agreed that they will never buy this product for their kids.  
 GIVEN KERIK'S REPORTED MOB TIES, AMORALITY AND CASHING IN ON THE 9/11 TRAGEDY, IT'S NO SURPRISE TO READ THIS CON JOB PIECE OF FICTION. HIS GHOSTWRITER IS PROBABLY A FICTION WRITER BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT IS WELL WRITTEN, THE STORY IS A FRAUD. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN SAUDI ARABIA? HE STALKED AND TERRORIZED WOMEN ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST. WHY DIDN'T MR. LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO CLAIMED TO BE SO HIGHLY SKILLED THAT HE COULD TRACK DOWN THE BIGGEST DRUG LORDS IN THE WORLD...TRACK DOWN HIS OWN INFANT DAUGHTER --THE ONE HE ABANDONED? HOW ABOUT THE TRUTH? HE IS A CON MAN, ABANDONED HIS OWN CHILD, IS EGOMANIACAL AND IS NOTHING MORE THAN A THUG. HE WRITES ABOUT SOME TEACHER IN SCHOOL WHO TOLD HIM HE WOULD NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING. GUESS WHAT? HE WAS RIGHT. BERNARD KERIK IS JUST WHAT THAT TEACHER SAID HE'D BE. A BIG ZERO 
  It hasn't been clinically proven that Perricone skin products work. My mom (age 46) tried them anyway, and they didn't work.  His advice to stay away from grains (and whatever comes from them, of course) is great, but not new. Yes, farm-raised salmon is screwed up, eat the wild one, but again, I knew that already.  And I disagree with his complicated "system" of taking supplements. If you just eat normal food, like vegetables and fruit, NOT grains and soda, you won't need supplements. The only supplement you need is fish oil, since farm-raised animals that we eat lack necessary fatty acids 
 This is truly one of the worst books I have ever read.  The writing style is tedious and jumbled.  Jacoby has little sense of logical flow.  But more importantly, her historical research is TERRIBLE.  The examples are endless, but for example: *Jacoby argues that the Founding Fathers really wanted a strict church and state separation, but then goes on to only quote Jefferson and Madison.  So what happened to the many other framers, such as Washington, Hamilton, Adams, Jay, and so forth?  Oh right, they probably didn't fit her argument just so, so she conveniently leaves them out. *According to Jacoby, Lincoln never mentioned the Almighty/God/Supreme Being in the Gettysburg Address.  Clearly, she has never read this speech. *Jacoby also blames organized religion for helping slavery keep its grip on the country.  Essentially, Jacoby sees it as an organized religion v. freethinking issue.  Wrong!  It was a sectional issue, and people from both groups supported both sides.  These are a few examples, and her bad work on these aspects is enough to make one doubt everything else she says.  Additionally, her critiques of 'non-freethinkers' is especially biting, and serves to make her sound childish rather than educated.    Save your money and buy something else 
 We never dropped our camera and until now its still looks fresh and new.  And one day, the lens just won't open.  It lights up then after a few seconds, it turns off automatically.  Called a up a Kodak Service center and they gave me a quote for repair.  The price they've given me is close to my purchase price here in Amazon!  I'll never buy a Kodak camera again until they come up with a good pricing for repairs.  I do believe that all electronic gadgets die at some point.  So I'm expecting a believable quote for repairs.  I think Kodak is making expensive disposable digital camera

 In 1993, Record, a former Senate Armed Services Committee staff member, authored Hollow Victory: A Contrary View of the Gulf War[1] in which he took President George H.W. Bush to task for not ousting Saddam Hussein. In the present book, Record takes George W. Bush to task for having corrected his father's mistake.  The new book, while well written, is reduced by the author's permeating antipathy for so-called neoconservatives, alleging without proof that a sympathy for Israel's Likud Party colors their view of the world. While it is true that neoconservatives tend to be staunch supporters of Israel, every president since Harry Truman has defended Israel's right to exist and to defend itself. Nor is there anything new about U.S. support for democracy or opposition to terror. The only recent development is a willingness of the U.S. government to reach out to new partners, even if this means working without traditional allies. Record further blames neoconservatives for "the president's controversial use-of-force doctrine," curiously overlooking the impact of 9/11 on Bush's thinking.  Record holds neoconservatives responsible for pursuing policies that cause many adversaries to dislike the United States. He laments "the Bush administration's foreign policy fails to grasp the fact that others do not see us as we see ourselves-that is, as a benign and historically exceptional force." But the Bush administration does grasp this; it just believes that being respected is more important than being liked. The costs of winning Syrian, North Korean, or Chinese favor for U.S. policy would be too high if it meant abandonment of democracies such as Israel, South Korea, and Taiwan. Conversely, Libyan strongman Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi may not like the United States, but it was his respect for the Bush administration's willingness to back force with military action that led to his decision to abandon his nuclear ambitions.  Record's style is confident and authoritative with plenty of facts cited and examples given. A close read, though, shows that Record ignores facts that undermine his arguments. For example, he trumpets a 1999 UNICEF report that relied on Iraqi government statistics to conclude that sanctions on Iraq killed 500,000 Iraqi children; he ignores a joint Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization study the following year that found that half the Iraqi population was overweight, and that hypertension and diabetes-not diseases of the hungry-were among the leading causes of Iraqi mortality.[2] Other facts he simply gets wrong. How could the Defense Department have airlifted Ahmad Chalabi into Iraq during military operations when Chalabi had returned to Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq months before the war began?  Dark Victory has many other weaknesses. Record engages in one-man's-terrorist-is-another's-patriot moral relativism. He conflates the Afghan mujahideen with Al-Qaeda, an anachronism that ignores a decade-long fight between Al-Qaeda pan-Islamists and Afghan nationalists such as Ahmad Shah Masud. While determined to debunk any analogy between postwar Japan and Iraq, Record ignores the South Korea example, frequently cited by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz. Notably absent from a book about Iraq is any consideration of what Iraqis think; Record writes as if Iraqis do not exist.  A book should be more than a glorified op-ed. Unfortunately, Dark Victory is not.  Middle East Quarterly, Spring 200 
 Cats cannot CANNOT be trained to be vegetarians, Unitarians or librarians. They eat meat. They need MORE protein and fat in their diet than dogs. Cats fed on carbohydrates develop a disease like cirrhosis of the liver. It's cruelty to animals to feed a cat on anything less than a the diet such as they require. They are carnivores, the way God made them. Ignore the advice in this book, please and feed your cat a healthy diet recommended by your vet. 
 This book would have been rated 0 stars if that were an option.  Its sparse 182 pages is completely devoid of information, prefering to fill white-space with microsoft clip art and large font drivel.  For example, a full page is dedicated to three different ways of labelling the spine of a three-ring binder.  Can I have my money back, please 
 This book is written poorly and it does not provide any information about measuring software. It simply rehashes theoretical statistics taught in 101 and that too in a difficult and hard to understand way 
 I had the complete opposite experience with this workout than did the previous reviewer.  The combination of doing upper and lower body exercises simultaneously caused my heartrate to soar which caused symptoms of overtraining.    Many people love this video but I just had a bad experience with it 
 I got this as a gift and if it wasn't alreay opened, I would have returned it. Theres nothing new or novel about the humor in the series. Its the same old tired race jokes throughout 
 OK...here's what I think: Anyone whose parents named him "Firpo" probably got a lot of teasing as a little boy, and the whole gay thing really upsets him and he's spent his entire adult career self-publishing these explanations for why he's not one of, you know, The Gays.  But really, any author who titles a book: Are Gays Really 'Gay'? A Sociological, Scientific, and Theological Analysis can't really be taken seriously. Theology has no place in science. And the assumption that theology is necessarly a benign source of information is laughable in an era in which the church-state line has been so thoroughly blurred. Though you have to admire the honesty with which the author trots out his blind faith in judeo-christian mythology to justify his bogus theses. This is not a scientist, this is a bigot who will twist facts and specious Biblical translations to suit his prejudices.  And if you liked this book, be sure to pick up Firpo's second book: Are Women Really 'Hysterical'? A Sociological, Scientific and Theological Analysis 
 This was required reading for my son going into fifth grade.  He is not a strong reader, and neither he nor I enjoyed it.  The combination of a large amount of flowery language and very little action made it a struggle to get through.  What little humor there was, was too sophisticated.  It was hard for us to identify with this foppish married mouse who ate caviar and champagne.  While I can appreciate that many (I guess most!) find it literary and delicious, my son found it boring, and looking at it through his eyes, I have to agree 
 This is not "Follies in Concert," it is the reader's digest version.  Many numbers have been truncated and many omitted, most notably "Waiting for the Boys Upstairs" and "The Road I Didn't Take."  While the concert itself ran over 130 minutes, the DVD is made from a 90 minute video tape.  Include the fact that they added about 30 minutes of rehearsal interviews, and the concert is basically cut in half.  In addition, the DVD is video tape quality and the sound is unstable.  All in all, a very disappointing recording for Sondheim lovers 
 Elliott Wave is the least practical approach to Technical Analysis I am aware of.  There are so many exceptions to the rules that govern EW that one can never gain enough confidence in the signal to put money to work. They say that if you get 12 EW practitioners in a room you will get 13 different wave counts. Believe me, there's a lot of truth in that statement! I am amazed that people actually take EW seriously.  There are plenty of very useful books on Technical Analysis, although there aren't very many well written ones.  I recommend any book by John Murphy, and also Trader Vic-Methods of a Wall Street Master which is a tremendous book that will teach you the most important thing to know; how to recognize the trend and when it changes 
 The material this is made out of is very uncomfortable; my normal size for everything is medium but this is not a medium watch how you size yoursel 
 Brigitte Lin, Maggie Cheung and Donnie Yen are amazing.  I was excited to see a movie that combined their talents, but "Dragon Inn" was a big disappointment.  The plot was too absurd for my liking, the characters felt a little two-dimensional and the fight scenes were only a fraction of what they could have been.  However, some people really like this movie a lot.  My recommendation would be to rent it first.    
 I know. I know. There aren't a lot of lesbian books and films out there so the insatiable public is supposed to embrace the few that do get published for consumption with enthusiasm. However, this dvd just did not rate way up there with Fingersmith--which was incredible. Buy that instead if you must spend your hard earned cash 
 I LOVE to read. In my life, I've probably spent more time reading than sleeping, altogether. I pretty much like every book I've ever read. My friend will hate a book, I will love it, and then they will point out that I never hate books, and that I am fiercly loyal to every book I read. That said, I HATED this book. It was boring. I wanted very badly to like it, because it had a unique storyline. I couldn't get into it. I kept hoping it would get interesting. It didn't. I kept leaving the book and getting up to do something....finally, I decided to get it over with and bring this book to camp with me. A camp where you have one hour of quiet time so I could finally force myself through this book. I brought no other books with me...and I still have no idea why I decided to put myself through that kind of torture. Needless to say, I threw this book back in my suitcase, and borrowed my friend's Harry Potter and read that for the millioneth time. It just seemed like every single word was just hanging in the air, doing nothing but being boring.  If you want some good dragon stories, in addition to this book or instead of it, Joust and its sequels (by Mercedes Lackey) are pretty good. Patricia C. Wrede has a good YA dragon quartet out, the first one is called Dealing with Dragons, one that I absolutely love. The DragonLance stories are pretty good (the ones by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, the originals, the rest are mostly [...]) although the first ones a bit slow to start, after that your addicted (to the series) and dragons are more of a sidenote, I still liked them. The above books are dragon books I liked, feel free to try them and hate them, but please don't hate them because I don't like this book. I understand, not too many people agree with me about this Dragonriders book, and that most people absolutly love it, but I'm just saying, I thought it was boring, thank-you for listening to my rant and putting up with my bad spelling (and writing :). If you haven't read this book, I'd suggest you check it out since so many other people love it, but read the first chapter before you buy it to make sure it's what you want. I don't want anyone else feeling like they wasted their money! Happy reading 
 I'm a huge Alton Brown fan. This is one of the books I asked for when my birthday came around. I thought I wanted it after reading the reviews and thought it sounded good. I was very disappointed. While there is some good information in it, it's mostly blank pages that you write your own recipes in w/ your notes. There are a few clear plastic pages so that you can put in recipe clippings and instructions and warranties for various kitchen gadgets, but a simple file folder would solve that. Sadly, I will be returning this book and finding something else to purchase 
 As a medical student, my metabolism class just covered this diet as an example of an unhealthy "Fad Diet" that makes claims that aren't true. Before we talk about the improper claims, however, I'd like to point out how the authors are scam artists.  They purport to have degrees from the "American College of Health Sciences," a prestigious-sounding university.  Harvey even has a DOCTORATE from there. However, they could never be hired in any hospital or be licensed to practice in any health-care field anywhere in the United States because the "American College of Health Sciences" is an UNACCREDITED CORRESPONDANCE COURSE "college".  Would you be treated by a surgeon or a family physician who learned his trade in one year through the mail?  Of COURSE not! So why would you trust someone with your health who "learned" the same way.  Now on to the diet...  You might ask why so many people seem to lose weight on this diet.  Well, only some people do and those that do, end up that way because all in all, it DOES reduce Caloric intake.  The only way to ACTUALLY lose weight is to reduce Caloric intake beyond daily needs (so that your body burns fat for those extra calories), but you don't have to do that by unhealthily cutting out foods with important nutrients.  You don't need to pay false-scientist scam artists your hard-earned money to be healthy.  Simply exercise 60 minutes a day, read food labels to count calories (the only diet SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN to work and KEEP WEIGHT OFF), and follow the food pyramid.  If you want to try something a little newer, follow the Mediterranian Diet food pyramid (you can Google it) which preaches moderation of ALL food types.  I've also been reading about the speed of the weight loss that people are getting.  To get that kind of weight loss (one pound a day, 10 pounds a week, whatever), is INCREDIBLY unhealthy.  Not only does it put HUGE amounts of stress on your body, but its also only possible by breaking down LEAN mass (muscle mass)as well as fat.  That's definitely not good for you! One Amazon reviewer even said that this occurred when he was on this diet.  There seems to be plenty of people that come on here saying this diet was great for them.  However, there are many more people that have ruined their health this way.    Finally, in response to the author's claims that food combinations can be unhealthy, it is all made-up lies and trickery.  They use false logic to make their diet and claims sound good when in reality, EVERY study done on this diet has proven their claims false.  There is something to be said about substances in some foods slowing the absorption of sugar and such (fat, for example), but the authors take that idea way too far, even claiming that eggs rot(!) in the body.  Doesn't that sound a little crazy?  You may ask that if all this is true, why doesn't the FCC or FDA or whoever stop them from publishing?  We have First Ammendment rights in this country and as long as the authors are not producing medications that make these claims, there is nothing that they can legally do.  Heck, a person can write a book that says eating glass is a great diet, and the gov't can't and won't stop them.  Please, if you think I'm just being ridiculous or that I don't know what I'm talking about, do a little research on your own.  Ask a doctor or dietician. Or go to these websites by ACTUAL physicians (from accredited Medical Schools) and scientists and see what they say about this diet:  [... 
 I HATE TO DISAGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEW.  I BOUGHT THE CD BECAUSE I PLAN TO SEE THE MOVIE.  I LOVE THE HYMS BUT THE MUSICAL ARRANGEMENTS WERE QUITE DISTRACTING.  FAIREST LORD JESUS, A BEAUTIFUL HYMN, SOUNDS LIKE A DANCE NUMBER.  PERHAPS I AM JUST GETTING OLD.  I DO HOPE EVERYONE SEES THE MOVIE 
 It's hard to believe the other reviewers here read the same book that I did! On the VERY FIRST PAGE, Mr. Savage expouses his contention that any time now he be unfaithful to his "partner", the poor unfortunate house husband and Mr. Mom, Terry -- literally, he states "he will have another man's c___k in his mouth". I'm sorry -- in what way does this qualify their relationship as the equivalent of a marriage suitable for the raising of a child? Having read Mr. Savage's column's in the local tabloids and also his book "Slouching Towards Gomorroah", I thought I was pretty hardened to his coarse sexualization of virtually everything, but even I was taken aback by the cruelty of anouncing on the first page of a book about your adopted child that you intend to cheat on your partner -- can you imagine how poor Terry feels about it?  The title is meant to be provocative and offensive to the Moral Majority (which I am decidedly not), but it shows some of the underlying problems here -- Dan and Terry obviously don't "get pregant", that's a biological impossibility. Neither was the birth of their adopted son "planned" . Language is an interesting thing, we can twist it to mean whatever we feel like. Both Dan and Terry are biologically normal, fertile, young men, and either could have easily concieved a biological child with a surrogate or a lesbian partner. They choose instead so-called "Open Adoption", and end up with the child of what they like to call througout the book "a street punk". In fact, the mother of the child is a mentally ill homeless woman, incapable of taking care of herself or even bathing, wearing clean clothes, etc. A lot of flapdoodle in the book is presented as Dan and Terry seem to struggle with the fact that the mom used some alcohol and drugs early in the pregnancy and if this presented a danger of fetal alcohol syndrome -- HELLO! this is the child of a severely mentally ill homeless person! What about hereditary mental illness? Apparently no one knows or cares or even calls this into question. After all, Dan and Terry have achieved the plum prize that every infertile straight couple drool over -- not merely a healthy child, but a BLOND BLUE-EYED BOY. How they gloat over THAT.  Even worse is humorist Savage's inability to talk seriously about the choice to become a parent at all. He insists that he only wants a child to have a "really expensive hobby" and so that he doesn't end up in old age as one of those lonely, ancient gay couples in South Beach surrounded by expensive antiques . (NOTE: if you think that children guarantee you will be treasured and cared for in old age, you have some serious disappointment awaiting you.) In the final analysis, it seems more that Dan Savage particpated in the adoptation because it was partner Terry's heartfelt wish to raise children...and indeed, it appears that Terry is the one staying at home and doing the "hands on" work of parenting.  It is worth knowing that Dan and Terry have relocated to Seattle, from Portland where the adoption was conducted. Could this be because the child's mentally ill, homeless, destitute mother will find it impossible to visit another state 4 times a year (as she is technically entitled)? So much for the lipservice of "open adoption". This is just more self-serving psychobabble and double-speak for "stealing the adoptable children of poor, helpless, homeless women." It doesn't make anything better that the thieves are gay rather than straight.  I went into this book with a generally accepting attitude towards gay adoption, and the feeling that anyone willing to buck a generally unsympathetic system must want very badly to have and raise children, and would therefore make good parents. This book has COMPLETELY changed my mind. I know that there are good, loving gay adoptive parents, but clearly the system is unable to screen out wealthy, manipulative, sleazy individuals like Dan Savage. This is a man who should not be allowed to adopt a pet, let alone a human child. My judgement has nothing to do with his homosexuality, and everything to do with his materialism, selfishness, sleazy morals, inability to comitt to a faithful relationship with a partner, open cruelty, and not least of all, his willingness to exploit both his partner and his adoptive child to make money from a sympathetic gay community 
 It sounded like a remix sung by someone else, not at all like the original.  My husband and I were very disappointed and because of it I haven't even opened the other CDs by KC & the Sunshine Band that I ordered.  Don't order this product 
 While this book is entertaining and even "informative", it is dangerous.  Over the years I know that much blame has been put on this book and even on the author, however, I think that it is the "informative" nature that makes it so dangerous.  I remember reading it for the first time (at age 11) and while I don't remember a clear "wow, anorexia is cool" thought going through my mind - it definitely opened a door.  Being a (naturally thin) gymnast and model, I think the book gave me ideas I wouldn't have had yet.  Do I blame the book?  Not entirely.  Would I let my daughter read it?  Definitely not. Choosing to starve myself to be thin has had repercussions that will last the rest of my life - I will always regret reading that book and making that choice 
 Useless book. The author just rewrote 12 Steps. Boring to read. I feel I wasted my time and money. 
 This book is written by Norman Geisler and Thomas Howe, two "fundamentalist" Christians who attempt to prove that the Bible is never wrong and always right, period.   Frankly, I was really annoyed when reading this book. The book is fundamentalist in the most negative sense of that term. The authors never really PROVE that the Bible is always right. They simply ASSUME it. Based on that assumption, they then employ various techniques to explain away every contradiction and error in the Bible. At times, their methods resemble that of shyster lawyers! No serious-minded sceptic will be convinced by this book, nor should they be.   Here are some of the problems with this book.   As already noted, the authors assume what they are trying to prove: the Bible is always right. The proof? The Bible says so itself. QED. Norman, are you kidding my donkey?! The Koran and the Book of Mormon also claim to be divine scripture. So does the Jewish Bible (minus the New Testament). So, indeed, does the Samaritan Pentateuch. And exactly what Christian Bible are we talking about, anyway? The Church Fathers had different ideas about what scriptures to include in the Bible. Why doesnt Geisler and Howe consider the Book of Enoch to be inerrant? Or the epistles of Ignatius, which mention monarchic bishops and one Catholic Church?   Further, the authors argue that the Bible is inerrant only in original. Since nobody has found the original, all proven errors in our Bibles might be later copyist errors. But if nobody has found the original, how do we know that our Bibles are correct in ANYTHING? Sometimes, the differences between ancient Jewish, Christian and Samaritan Bible manuscript are pretty decisive. Incidentally, the Koran and the Book of Mormon claim to be perfect, in contrast to the Bible, which both Muslims and Mormons believe is forged or mistranslated.   Third, the authors make a dubious analogy between science and Bible study. If something in the Bible looks wrong, instead of rejecting it, we should study the issue further. Eventually, we will surely discover that the Bible is right! But this is NOT the attitude of the scientist. Rather, it is the attitude of a pseudo-scientist who declares: "I dont believe in gravity. True, everyone else does. But if we study the issue for another 200 years, Im sure I will be proven right. Ergo gravity does not exist".   Fourthly, the authors often give more than one solution to a single Bible difficulty. How come Genesis doesnt square with modern science? Perhaps modern science is wrong. Or perhaps our way of interpreting Genesis is wrong. Either way, Genesis itself is right (!!!). Using this kind of method, anything can be proved. Perhaps the Grand Rapids phone directory contain some hidden truths about the eternal questions?   Sometimes, the method of the two authors border on conscious fraud. The Gospel of Matthew says there was only one angel at the empty tomb of Jesus, while John says there were two. This obvious contradiction is "solved" in the following manner: Matthew never says that there was ONLY one angel at the tomb. Therefore there might have been two. After all, where there is two, there is always at least one...   WHAAAAAAAAAAT???????   Imagine a lawyer using that kind of argument to save his client from being indicted for perjury: "Your honor, he never said ONLY one assasin. So this doesnt contradict the crown witness, who said there were TWO assasins. After all, where there is two, there is always one, right? Besides, my client is inerrant in his original manuscripts".   OK, Im slightly out of line here, but I think you get my point...   Let me just make one final point. Although the book is 615 pages long, certain difficulties are never answered. For instance, the authors never comments on 1 Thessalonians 2:14-15, according to which the Jews killed Jesus and are enemies of all humankind. Perhaps the two authors are pro-Israeli, and therefore find this verse particularly embarrasing?   If you think Im over-exagerating, by all means, buy this book, and look everything up for yourself.   Time for a hot coffee!!  
 As you probably have read by now, this album is a compilation of material previously released as B-sides - and it probably should have stayed that way. Although this album is better than the absurdly awful "Be Here Now" - it is not as terribly bad and annoying as that album - there are real no standout tracks on this album. "Acquiesce," the first track is decent, but other tracks are average, don't stick out and don't stay in your memory long, or are just bad. I borrowed this CD from the library for 3 weeks and gave it several listens. That is usually enough time for me to judge an album enough for me to know whether it's worth buying, and this one just isn't. [...]  Oasis must have spent all their creative energy on Definitely Maybe and (What's the Story) Morning Glory because they have not made an album that is even half-decent since then.  I have wasted a lot of time borrowing CD's released since their two breakthrough albums wondering "hmm... what ever happened to Oasis anyway?" to see if they released any decent material since their glory days.  The answer is NO and I do not recommend listening to any albums after their first two.  I did the same thing with Collective Soul's later albums, a group that has continued to release good material even after their glory days in the mid-90s, but not Oasis.  Must be the coke 
 I actually bought this book via reference from '100 ways to motivate yourself'.  The first two thirds are very dry and it taughts about the history of research on learned helplessless.  What I am seeking is 'How to'..which is later part of the book but it was a bit hard to digest 
 The transaction went fine. The product is comparatively far over priced. I was almost "drummed out" of an organization where I am the secretary, for spending that much on this item. We have a competitor's product for half the price, that rivals this Sony ICD-BM1 Recorder. Don't buy it!    
 This would have been a good skit, or maybe a short story, but not an entire novel.  The book is tired like the town Wigfield 
 soros cannot support this forever, air america eventually has to survive on it's own. there are indications it's already on it's last legs. think what you want about limbaugh but he made it the hard way. he persevered and never gave up, after failing several times, and starving along the way. there were no millionaires to get him started. air america? manufactured entertainment with hysterical political opinion. how the left longs for the good old days of their  idea of fair and balanced, with a cnn panel of three liberal's and one moderate conservative, and a liberal host,  with the lone conservative being shouted down. fox has changed all that. I will miss listening to franken and his ilk go through their histrionics though. 
 FIrst off, let me say that I am Jewish myself and grew up in a Catholic neighborhod, where my family was one of the only Jewish families around. So I know plenty about being the "odd girl out" during the holiday season, with many of my own humorous tales.  However, I think it is wildly misleading to label a story collection "The Worst Noel" and then have more than half the stories about Jews who either are celebrating a bogus Christmas they clearly don't believe in (for the parties and gifts) or angsting because they are stuck with the incredibly lame Festival of Hannukah, the poor stepchild of Christmas. There is certainly a place for the assimilated (or unassimilated) Jewish writers to pour forth their anguish or glee or awkwardness, but it is NOT in a book glaringly mislabeled "The Worst Noel". Maybe it's in a book that could be called "The Worst Hannukah" or "The Worst Chrismukkah".  Anyone even nominally Christian, or even non-sectarian, who picks up this book hoping to read actual funny stories about CHRISTIANS celebrating THE MOST IMPORTANT HOLIDAY OF THE YEAR is going to feel wildly cheated. After all, Jews make up roughly 1.5% of the US population (although disproportionately more of the book buying public). It would make more sense to write about a Muslim's outlook on Christmas or a Hindu's or even an atheist's.  Maybe the publisher thought a story collection called "Dysfunctional Jews At Christmastime" wouldn't sell. But this book is a cheat and misleading. While about 1/3 of the stories are genuinely funny (although collected here inappropriately), the rest are often whiny and betray an insulated sense of privilege, as they are entirely about wealthy, educated intellectuals whose idea of how to celebrate the holidays bumps up against Southerners, low-lifes, non-intellectuals and peope with -- GASP! -- bad taste.  I guess therefore that "bad taste" is the ultimate sin against Christmas. I don't read any ringing indictments of tasteful, Martha Stewart/Pottery Barn celebrations.  HINT: buying this for a Christian friend or family member as a holiday gift would be a huge mistake 
 ...unless it is rock and roll played by ac/dc. i f***ing HATE them. they are overplayed so much on the radio, and that is the most annoying voice i have ever heard in my life. don't waste your money on this cd, just turn on the radio...then turn it off 
 In her book, Kathleen Brown offers a revision of colonial Virginia history. Relying almost entirely upon previously known and explored primary materials, she constructs an argument that gender heavily influenced colonial development.        Breaking her book up chronologically into three parts, Brown focuses first on England and the Virginia colony's early days. In discussing the former, she establishes the role of women who adhere to social behavioral norms as that of good wives, and those who do not adhere to those norms as nasty wenches. In the case of Virginia, she explores the role of women in English society vis a vis Powhatan's Algonquian society. When Powhatan offered women to English settlers, whether for marriage or a night's enjoyment, he did so for political reasons; the settlers, however, thought Indians valued women less, and differently, than they did. Settlers further grappled with the fact that women farmed while men, they thought, took it easy, hunting and fishing.        The second part focuses on the change in roles of women, and the corresponding change in how men though of them. As Virginia became more permanent, and as slaves became more prevalent, "good wives" came to mean the elite women, whereas "nasty wenches" meant servant or non-elite women. Following Bacon's Rebellion, this labeling shifted somewhat as elite men attempted to break the unofficial alliance between black slaves and white servants. Principally, the violations of white women that formerly would have made them nasty wenches now were less serious, while those same violations of black women were more so.        The last part explores the domination of men and the lives of elite women. Men became much more patriarchal, establishing social norms and laws to that effect. They were "anxious" in the sense that they were now required to hold domination over their wives, families, and farms, and maintain strict adherence to those norms and laws. Relying heavily on the writings of William Byrd II and Landon Carter, Brown points out the fears these men had of declining virility, disobedient sons, and the like. Women, meanwhile, came together against their husbands, quietly undermining them on occasions, especially in discipline issues, and generally developing a women's society of tea parties and such.        On the one hand, Brown's revisionist attempt is a worthwhile endeavor; only the foolish would say women had no role or impact whatsoever in colonial development. As historians have largely ignored or downplayed this role, her study is therefore relevant. On the other hand, she delves far too deeply into the sex lives of leading men. Her study was not one solely of the role of gender, but also of sexuality. To a certain and very limited extent that exploration is worthwhile-certainly the colonists were concerned with fornication, bastardy and the like-but do I, the reader, really need to know on which days Byrd gave his wife a "flourish," and whether or not he was "vigorous"? No. Furthermore, certain inherent flaws exist in a reinterpretation that relies heavily on modern and liberal views of sex and sexuality. Consequently, there are certain aspects of the book that are worth reading, but one should select those aspects carefully. 
 I order this item becasue it was cheap .49 cheap and paind about $3.45 in shipping. Well this seller must be using AMazon as a con because they never sent the book and pocted the $4.00. Watch out 
 Another left-wing, hippie idiot who dropped out of any sort of real career in 1975 has to sustain himself by writing this anti-technology dystopic rubbish.  I'm sure that he has plenty of ideological fellow travelers in Hollywood with whom he should team up to make another version of "12 Monkeys" or "The Fight Club."  This is just left-wing, nihilist, anti-human rubbish motivated by a hatred of humanity and mans' productive capacity.    Like, the world ended when we ran out of trees to burn as fuel?  I'm sure that trees were cheaper than coal for 15th or 16th century Britain, but they made the transition from one energy source to another without resorting to cannabilism or having their civilization self-destruct like this author would have us believe.  The collapse of civilizations is not tied to the end of cheap energy, but is more likely due to a descent into decadence and sloth.  If there is not enough oil, we can switch to coal, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and nuclear (fission or fusion-in the future).    All these self-styled futurists are just full of rubbish and make predictions which they then sell to an ignorant public just so they can pay their rent.  Most science fiction is garbage and this just proves my point.  How many science fiction authors in the early 1980's or before predicted the emergence of the internet?  Almost none by my estimate.  Don't waste your money helping this guy pay his rent.  He's a nihilist and misanthrope.    As long as men are free to think, communicate and trade, long-term optimism is the order of the day as the secular trend for civilization is always upwards and onwards 
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 For a film that's supposed to be ghetto based with Tupac as a star it has about 5 minutes of Shakur and the rest is simply a walk  around with Rouke's character walking around looking for a reason to get into the morgue or back in jail.  High profile names do nothing for this film. Brody doesn't have the ganster film look....Rouke's character does nothing for me and Shakur's role in the film  was just that of a gang banger.    Recommended if you are a fan of any of the above.   If you want to see a good film see something else 
 "A monkeywrench thrown into the gears of the machine may not stop it. But it might delay it, make it cost more. And is feels good to put it there."(Foreman, 23) - Dave Foreman   Author Dave Foreman is the cofounder of Earth First! and self-realized eco-warrior. Published in 1991, Foreman says the main purpose of his book is to motivate potential activists into action. His book lays out his reasoning for engaging in what he calls conservation. He portrays himself as a very mild-mannered, caring, and rational person, and not the radical eco-terrorist I was envisioning. But that should not deter the reader from the underlying message he is selling: humanity is secondary to air, water, land, and animals. And destruction of private property (sometimes risking the lives of humans) is the only means available to accomplish the preservation of Earth. While he lays out some very sound reasons as to why the environment (Earth) is under attack and needs human attention, his methods of execution harm the broader conservancy movement, make little impact on large-scale environmental destruction, and can be dangerous to innocent bystanders.  Of course, Foreman acknowledges that his methods are radical and fall outside of mainstream conservancy. He claims that larger organizations such as the Sierra Club have lost their vision and have become entangled in the bureaucracy of Washington. Foreman says that these mainstream environmental groups achieve nothing through lobbying and other bureaucratic modes. Foreman calls for direct action by motivated individuals to literally throw a monkeywrench into the gears of the machine. Foreman doesn't go into too much detail about how to do this, but makes it clear that disabling bulldozers or spiking trees are the only methods Earth-destroyers respond to (in tree-spiking, long metal nails are driven into trees. When loggers cut them down and send them to the mills, the saw blades are shattered by the spike therefore causing hundred or thousands of dollars in damage. Foreman addresses a specific instance where a saw blade was shattered and pieces of it flew into the faces of the workers. Foreman has the audacity to suggest that the tree-spikers were not to blame. The saw, he says shattered because it was old. A newer blade would've only been dismantled and rendered useless. This disregard for human safety is the core flaw of Foreman's logic. While he reluctantly condemns the use of tree-spiking, it grudgingly takes him awhile to come to that conclusion. Any sane person would see that these actions are destined to harm humans on multiple levels).      Earth First! Principals (quoted directly from the book. This "logic" pretty much says it all):  - A placing of Earth first in all decisions, even ahead of human welfare if necessary.  - A refusal to use human beings as the measure by which to value others.  - An enthusiastic embracing of the philosophy of Deep Ecology or biocentrism.  - A realization that wilderness is the real world.  - A recognition that there are far too many human beings on Earth.  - A deep questioning of, and even an antipathy to, "progress" and "technology."  - A refusal to accept rationality as the only way of thinking.  - A lack of desire to gain credibility or "legitimacy" with the gang of thus running human civilization.  - An effort to go beyond the tired, worn-out dogmas of left, right, and middle-of-the-road.  - An unwillingness to set any ethnic, class, or political group of humans on a pedestal and make them immune from questioning.  - A willingness to let our actions set the finer points of our philosophy and a recognition that we must act.  - An acknowledgment that we must change our personal life-styles to make them more harmonious with natural diversity.  - A commitment to maintaining a sense of humor, and a joy in living.  - An awareness that we are animals.  - An acceptance of monkeywrenching as a legitimate tool for the preservation of natural diversity.  - And finally: Earth First! Is a warrior society. "In addition to our absolute commitment to and love for this living planet, we are characterized by our willingness to defend Earth's abundance and diversity of life, even if that defense requires sacrifices of comfort, freedom, safety, or, ultimately, our lives. A warrior recognizes that her life is not the most important thing in her life. A warrior recognizes that there is a greater reality outside her life that must be defended. For us in Earth First!, that reality is Earth, the evolutionary process, the millions of other species with which we share this bright sphere in the void of space." (Foreman, 26-35)     MONKEYWRENCHING  "It is time for women and men, individually and in small groups, to act heroically in defense of the wild, to put a monkeywrench into the gears of the machine that is destroying natural diversity. Though illegal, this strategic monkeywrenching can be safe, easy, fun, and-most important-effective in stopping timber cutting, road building.............." (Foreman, 113)  I find this aspect of eco-terrorism (ecotage or monkeywrenching as Foreman calls it) the most disturbing. He claims that since moderate, bureaucratic environmentalist groups such as the Sierra Club do nothing in the fight against the Earth-destroying forces, it is therefore up to subversive individuals to take matters into their own hands to stop the machinery of destruction. This, he states, is accomplished through the dismantling and destruction of these mechanisms one by one (spiking trees, rendering bulldozers useless, etc). Foreman claims that monkeywrenchers are acting under the same principles as the Boston Tea Party, Gandhi, the French Resistance, and even Martin Luther King Jr. He claims that in desperate times, laws must be subverted and broken in order to bring about a higher justice. I can agree with the logic that revolution over a corrupt system may be necessary from time to time, but he misses the key ingredient in his historical examples: unity. The American Revolutionaries, Gandhi's non-violence, the anti-Nazi movement, and the civil rights movement all had mass support behind them and were united in a specific cause. Eco-defenders are disjointed, have varying degrees of motivation, and all have different ideas of how environmental concerns should be addressed.  Foreman's assessment, however, is that organized resistance has been tried and doesn't work (he defeats his own logic here. By citing examples of historical, organized resistance, he fails to see that he is actually advocating the opposite: disjointed, random resistance). While Foreman condemns tree-spiking (extremely reluctantly, and with a slight wink-wink as if to say `I have to say that for legal reasons, but go ahead anyway') he fails to realize the uncontrollable juggernaut he's unleashed. Using the theory of virtually unbridled ecotage, eco-warriors have started to use arson as their method of choice. The infamous Hummer dealership that was torched, the fires of Southern California are said to be linked to eco-terrorism, and the burning of housing developments in Arizona have all been very close to harming innocent bystanders. Of course the eco-defender would say that the fact that no humans were hurt is evidence that their actions are just. But as anyone can plainly see (except Foreman), the practice of ecotage is only a few steps away from murder. Somewhere, somehow, somebody is going to be trapped in one of these fires and wind up dead. While Foreman may be able to shape his precise vision of minimally-destructive ecotage, he fails to realize that his approval of reckless youth engaging in unsupervised destruction of property is a recipe for disaster.  Besides the obvious dangers of ecotage to human life, has the practice of monkeywrenching really produced noticeable results? Sure, there's been lots of press and fear generated, but has a single one of these disjointed efforts stopped the great machine in anyway? Foreman acknowledges that the actions of individuals will only achieve small results. He seems to believe that all of these small steps will somehow add up to a reversal of eco-destruction. It is clear that it hasn't and won't. Hummers still roll off the assembly line, urban sprawl is still imminent, and forests are still harvested despite the efforts of a few flea bites.  Foreman's condemnation and frustration with the bureaucratic environmental groups is understandable. They seems to make a lot of noise, but don't really get much accomplished. After all, my air is still dirty, my water is still polluted, and my food is still laden with who-knows-what. I can understand why he would want to take more drastic matters in hand. While it is true that there is a desperate need to reshape the industries and governments which cause these unprecedented pollutants, doing so with such flawed logic as Foreman's is unproductive. Like the American Revolution or the civil rights movement, eco-defenders' only recourse will be unity in cause and action; a cause and action that puts humans on the same level as Earth and its other inhabitants, not as secondary citizens prone to harm 
 For those who are wondering why the PG rating for this movie, well, I'm wondering too. This is one of the cleanest movies I've ever seen.  Not one utterence of foul language.  Not one utterence of d***, h***, or any irreverence of the use of the word God.  Just a clean, clean movie from beginning to end.  The only scene that I could think of that would draw a PG rating is when the grandfather died and they had a funeral.  Everything connected to this was brief and something I would not object to my children watching.  If there's anything else, I missed it, and I watched this movie intently from beginning to end.   For those who are looking for a true family-friendly movie, this is it. No foul language, no violence, no sexual innuendo.  Nothing that any member of the family could not watch.  Kleenex will be needed though.  
 What is this Lincoln cult that Dilorenzo speaks of?  Last time I checked, pro-Southeners like Shelby Foote (RIP) were saying the same admiring things about Lincoln as all the Lincoln jock riders that DiLorenzo despises so much.  Seriously, I have no problem with bringing Lincoln to task for his mistakes -- but this guy seems to know absolutely nothing about the political and social context of the civil war years.   Secession is legal:  Even the doughfaces in Buchanan's cabinet though the union unbreakable--as did most of Lincoln's own party.  Secession is criminal -- so said James Madison.  If he doesn't know what's constitutional, who does?  Read Chisholm vs Georgia 1793, McCullough vs Maryland 1819.  Or Webster.  Or better yet, Andrew Jackson.  Tariffs:  The total revenues of the Federal government in 1860 amounted to $56 million with a population of 34 million.  Federal taxation per capita amounted to less than $2 per person.  Yes, the Slavocracy were lightly taxed on luxury goods imported into the south -- goods that they "earned" by wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces.  Then again, the Federal government before the war lost close to 9 million dollars every year delivering mail in the south because of decaying roads and an archaic transportation system. (They profited heavily in the more modernized north.)  What's funnier than hell is that the Confederacy itself placed tariffs on exports. Hypocritical.   civil liberties:  Yes, evil King Lincoln suspended habeas corpus -- actually he was goaded into it by Seward, who feared an invasion of the capitol.  Jefferson Davis suspended habeas corpus, too.  What does Dilorenzo think about that?  Unfortunately, Dilorenzo hardly ever brings up the virtual identical actions of the Confederacy or the fact that liberty was stepping on even harder during the Revolutionary War (thanks, in no small part, to Dilorenzo's hero, Thomas Jefferson (read Jefferson and Civil Liberties: The Dark Side).    Jeff Davis -- responsible for conscription, martial law, suspending habeas corpus, shutting down newspapers and making southerners carry id cards.  Confederate jails were filled with men like Parson Brownlow of the Knoxville Whig, who rotted in one of the Confederacy's "libertarian" prisons for two years for describing the average southern soldier as brainwashed by the Slavocracy, dirt poor yet bragging that he should be allowed to bring his slaves into the territories.  colonization:  Actually DiLorenzo's hero Thomas Jefferson, in one of his more antislavery moments, was the first president to mention colonization as an effective solution to the race problem.  Lincoln went along with it -- even the most militant abolitionists like Chase supported colonization -- publicly until he got Northerns to grudgingly accept the idea of enlisting black troops, then never spoke of colonization again.   
 This book was not entertaining.  I suffered through each page.  I hated the plot and most of the characters.  I will never read another Doss book again 
 Alt's was my first raw foods book and got me intrigued with eating raw mostly because I'd not seen anything else on the subject before. It's not by any means the best, however. As other reviewers indicate, this is a sketchy raw foodism guide that's heavy on Alt's personal experiences with a large dose of "glam." She does offer encouragement and good suggestions for getting into raw eating. However, other books do that sort of thing far better and in greater, more useful detail. Jennifer Cornbleet's recent Raw Food Made Easy is a much better transitional book with detailed shopping hints, even a list of precisely what and how much produce to buy for a week's worth of using her recipes. Also, Cornbleet's recipes require no fancier equipment than a blender and food processor. Take a glance at Alt's, buy Cornbleet's book 
 Since when was it good music for a guy who sounds like a girl to blurt out expletives overtop of lame chord progressions? Never! This album seems to be the band's most respected work, though if you ask me they deserve no respect. The brains of all these five star reviewers have apparently been numbed musically, because surely no-one in an upright American society would be fooled into thinking this so-called "Music" is actually good for the ears. Wrong-o! This album, right here, is the worst CD I have ever heard. I promise you that is no spur of the moment exaggeration, it's just so awful. This band needs to lose its popularity NOW. They're just like New Found Glory and Rush; ruined by the singer. But in this case, the music wouldn't have been any good with another singer even; everything that could go wrong has. If you want GOOD music, ya ain't gonna find it here! I highly recommend Muse, Fatboy Slim, Chemical Brothers, and Oasis, but that's just me. This CD is so horrible; I could go on forever about its inferiority in the music world but the music speaks for itself. Sheesh does it suck. 'Tis all 4 now 
 This was a total change from the boardgame. It is a lot of fun, however I have changed the winning amount, otherwise someone can win the whole game with just one hand 
 Musical scores were on spot, rich and compelling, imparting  emotional PUNCH! Chemistry was somewhat skewed between Kidman and Enman. The rule of "show don't tell" was broken periodically throughout dialogue, particuarly in Enman's dialogue when he goes from scene to scene "announcing" to each one he meets he's in love. Scenes were pleasantly varied, many of which were extraordinarily vivid and detailed with an interesting host of characters, however portions of acting came across as plastic and trained. It seems as though this movie tried to do "too much" and as a result the plot became vexed with business. A cornicopia of  scene effects, ranging from  surreal, to tragic, to tongue in cheek, to implausible (with the widow dancing and smiling shortly after she had witnessed losing her entire family to a massacre?) made it difficult at last to gain an emotional foothold and invest, although emotional offerings run like spooked herds throughout the production with the aid of ethereal soundtracks.  Speaking of implausible - The friendship that ensued  between the red-haired minister and Enman, in light of their initial conflict, seemed rather far fetched and silly, moreso with the minister commanding something more akin to a Broadway theatrical stage presence than a real person might portray given the strain of the times. Renee' Zelwegger did well but proved unbelievable for me in light of her typecasting and excellent role in Jerry MacGuire. Nicole Kidman was not in her element, yet even here in the role of a helpless swooner her acting credentials were present. This film was over-starred and substantially miscast. Didn't need Donald as Kidman's father and Kidman and Zellwegger's tension between themselves proved more distracting than complimentary. Overall the movie was interesting but lengthy to a fault. Undeniably a remarkable collaborative brainfest that in several ways might have been greatly improved. 
 I would possibly recommend this book for children but not for the serious reader or someone who needs information pertaining to African-American scientists and inventors. The book has a very elementary style of writing and few citations of where the information was obtained. I was expecting a book with deep information of African-American history but was disappointed in the juvenile nature of the book 
 I have purchased 3 I thought its feather bed pad something as the description but its end up to be only a cover so its just not good to buy online " on Amazon"because you can't really expect what you are gonna get. please becareful 
 This supposedly "new" item looked like it had been either used a few times or someone had left it out in the rain.  It arrived with the one-page instruction sheet wrapped around the plastic tool.  The silver knob that you can see on the left side of this "tool" was rusted and would not turn very easily.  I'm not sure how this tool is effective in removing stubborn watch band pins.  Maybe this tool is effective in only removing pins from cheaply manufactured watches - much like this item.  When I attempted to use it, the entire plastic body would flex and I was afraid that it would snap if I twisted the knob any further.  Not worth the sale price that it was advertised.  The most effective way of using it was to remove the knob and pin from the apparatus and gently tap the end with a hammer in order to loosen the pins.  This is definitely not worth the sale price 
 What a waste of time, you knew all along what was going to happen and the characters are all just a little too perfect to be normal and believable.   Some things are totally out there... for exapmle, Allegra is woken up in the middle of the night to bail her client out of jail? Come on! Lawyers are not ethically permited to post bail for their clients. Do some research Danielle, like the rest of the authors do... don't rely on what you see on television. No lawyer would ever give out their home number, let alone answer calls in the middle of the night.   And I am sick and tired of this obsession this author has with thinness. A size 10 is fat? Women like to read about characters who they can relate to and are like themselves... not the ideal woman created by the male world.   Don't waste time on this book, unless you are still in high school.  
 The publishers made a typo error in this book's title - they added an "f".  Instead of "Another Life", it should more appropriately be titled "Another Lie."  Although it is a  well-written and fairly entertaining memoir, it is the Napoleonic ambitions  of its author that make it a very dubious and unreliable addition to any  non-fiction library.  Due to Michael Korda's supremely fragile ego, always  in danger of having to be placed in intensive care, everything in this book  must be viewed very skeptically.  Korda not only takes credit for himself  but distorts and erroneously states facts so that he can be the hero and  the mastermind.  After reading a few chapters, I became suspicious of  Korda's "memory" when he always appeared as the brilliant,  all-knowing catalyst of every event he was participating in.  When I came  to his chapter on his relationship with Graham Greene, I had the sense he  was exaggerating his teenage friendship with the famous author - logic just  wasn't on Korda's telling of the tale, especially since none of the  principals are alive to offer a differing view, as is true for most of  Korda's stories.  But, as for facts, I decided to do some research and  check what Korda was relating about his publshing career.  Alas, he has  created more fiction than fact in relating these tales.  I could write half  a book on his lies and misrepresentations, but I merely use one case in  point.  His experience with the bestselling novelist Susan Howatch.  On  pages 309 and 3l0 Korda presents Howatch as "some unknown woman in New  Jersey sitting at her kitchen table and holding her baby as she wrote"  the book which HE discovered and became the best seller  "Penmarric".  This was l970 and Korda paints the scene as if he  is plucking an unknown first author and using HIS great judgment to  determine that she, indeed, has written a great book.  ACTUALLY, Susan  Howatch had begun writing novels in l965 and was a successful and respected  author of three novels published by Stein & Day by the time Korda  caught up with her. It's rather clumsy and absurd to present her as his  discovery, BUT Korda goes on to state that he perceptively noticed the  subtle parallel between "Penmarric"'s plot and the lives of Henry  II and Eleanor of Aquitaine.  He relates how Howatch reluctantly confessed  to having borrowed the historical plot and was nervous that someone else  might also notice.  Korda, fully confident of his own superior brillance,  assured her that no one would, and he states that they went ahead and  published the book and not one reviewer commented on the Henry and Eleanor  similarities.  HOW CURIOUS.  Especially since Howatch's book states in  passages at the beginning of every chapter the Henry and Eleanor story and  how it applies to the following chapter.  She plainly wrote the parallel  right there in the book and used it for the structure of her novel.  And  every book review commented on this fact, especially the New York Times,  who thought it added greatly to the book's success.  What is Korda talking  about!  I'm afraid every chapter is filled with such self-serving lies and  erroneous facts that only serve to elevate poor little Michael Korda's  sense of self-importance.  The real crime here is how Korda gets away with  these very easily checkable lies and how his legendary Editor, Robert  Loomis of Random House, can allow this obvious distortion of truth to get  publish.  It's just not sloppy and careless editing, for which the aging  Loomis is becoming famous, it is the deliberate distortion of their own  industry and a real lowering of standards. This collaboration of Korda and  Loomis and its careless and fictionalized view of the New York book world  is far more eloquent than anything Mr. Korda has to say in his book. Yes,  book publishing really has gone downhill, and Korda and Loomis have taken  it another giant leap 
 "Othello" is a play that will show you how unredeemable human beings can be.  It'll make you question everyone, along with his or her motives and beliefs.  It also shows you how men lusted after women in the late 16th century, but how women could not lust after men.  The double standard was put to the test, and, as always, women lose this battle.  Women may sell themselves as whores, and are ridiculed for it, but the men who use their services are overlooked.  This is a foul play and I think Shakespeare held women without regard. Othello was a despicable man who had little self-esteem I do not recommend 
 I purchased this took and then found that it was just a reprint from several decades ag 
 No matter how one feels about Peter Singer as an ethicist, this books shows he's thoroughly incompetent as an editor. I am rather surprised that Oxford University agreed to put its imprint on this volume as an "Oxford Reader." The selections from pivotal ethicists, e.g., Aristotle, Kant, Hume, Bentham, and Sidgwick are ridiculously lowly, inconsequential, or scattered, so "coherence" is lost. Their minor pericopes omit their critical and vital insights; all their important ideas are egregiously overlooked. E.g., Aristotle's doctrine of the mean, eudaimonia, Kant's doctrine of Kingdom of Ends, Categorical Imperative, are just some of the major omissions. Natural law theory doesn't mention the name of Aquinas. The selections that support an evolutionary orientation are a little bit better. The selection from Hume on benevolence is marginal. The essays by Ayer and Wittgenstein are great, but not enough to justify this book. I can't imagine what this book is good for. It certainly fails as an introduction to ethics. It also fails as a current controversy in ethics. It might be used as an intermediate ethics course for some of the pericopes. To say this book is a disappointment is an understatement.  Disclaimer: Singer is a utilitarian. I don't know how anyone in the 21st C. can use utilitarianism as an "ethic" much less as a system of "morality." Scheffler, Williams, Nozick, et alia should have put this nonsense to rest, as Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, and even Hitler were great utilitarians, which is precisely the point. But that aside, I think it skews his editorial judgments as well. For ethics, Aristotle, for morality, Kant, and for benevolence, Smith and Hume. Otherwise, leave the utilitarian calculus for tyrants 
 Birch once again gives us more information about herself than is needed.  Check out Donna Farhi's "Yoga: Mind, Body and Spirit" for a more thorough examination of the subject matter without all of the self-important jibber-jabber 
  In this book Bash Dibra, the self-styled "dog trainer to the stars," recounts some of his experiences raising and training an actual wolf.  You'd think this would lend a great deal of credence to Dibra's training techniques and to his retelling of the now discredited alpha theory, which states that the social instincts of dogs and wolves is based on who's most dominant within the pack's hierarchical structure.  But since this book was initially published in the early 1990s, it's now totally out of date and off-base, at least from a theoretical standpoint.  For instance early in the book Dibra says, "You should take the alpha role with your puppy early or he will always try to dominate you."  But the top wolf experts don't even like to use the word alpha anymore because, as David Mech puts it, "It falsely implies a hierarchical system in which a wolf assumes a place in a linear pecking order."  (Canadian Journal of Zoology, 2002.)  Mech has also stated that in wild wolves "dominance displays are uncommon."  So how can you "play the alpha role" with your puppy if there is no such thing as alpha?  And why would a puppy always try to dominate you if dominance displays are rare in nature?    Why the disparity?  Because it turns out that the alpha theory was based on studies done on wolves kept captive in sanctuaries, not on the behavior of actual wild wolf packs, who behave in a more cooperative and harmonic manner than captive wolves (or most dominance trainers) do.  Dibra also says that training a dog to lie down on command is difficult because lying down is a submissive posture and dogs never want to be submissive.  There are two flaws in the logic here: First of all, the posture for the obedience "down" -- lyiing with the spinal column in a straight line, head up -- is radicallly different from a submissive down -- rolling over on one side and putting a back leg up in the air.  That posture would not win points at an obedience trial!  Meanwhile, Patricia Gail Burnham, in PLAYTRAINING YOUR DOG, says that she saves the down for last because it's too EASY.  Again, why the disparity?  The other flaw in Dibra's logic: if dogs always want to dominate and never be submissive, and training them is about showing that YOU'RE dominant, doesn't that describe an ongoing, unending battle between you and your dog's instincts?  Does that sound healthy, happy, and productive?  Wouldn't it be better to find a way -- as Pat Burnham, Kevin Behan, and others do -- to work WITH your dog's instincts and not be constantly battling them?  With that said, there ARE some good bits of training advice here: don't rush the training process, give your dog lots of vigorous exercise, etc.  Just keep far, far away from anything that smacks of dominance...the logic of that approach no longer makes any sense 
 The books that comprise the "Narratives of Empire" series were not written in order, and if you're reading them in order the cracks show up here in the sixth and final volume. In each volume, Vidal includes a preface telling you the story of the book you're about to read, and proudly reminding you that the entire series is the chronicle of a single family, direct in descent from Aaron Burr to himself. Yet when we get to "Washington DC" we learn that it was Blaise Sanford who purchased the Washington Tribune all those years ago and launched his publishing career, not his half-sister Caroline. In fact, Caroline Sanford has utterly ceased to exist, despite having been our main character during the previous two novels, during which she, yes, purchased the Washington Tribune and launched HER publishing career, only allowing Blaise to buy a 48% share years later when he was desperate. What's more, it was Caroline's mother who was descended from Burr, not Blaise's, as readers of volume three know perfectly well, which means that there are no more descendants of Burr left by volume six. Hmph 
 In fact, it made me feel kind of anxious at times.  I normally use a "guided imagery" CD to help me sleep (Belleruth Naparstek), but sometimes I get bored with it, so I wanted to try something different.  "Delta" certainly is different. I wouldn't call it music, but rather a a variety of long, slow sounds that sort of remind me of 2001, a Space Odessey. I am glad that many people have found it soothing, but I simply could not get on the right wave-length; in fact, I did not sleep a wink using the "Delta Sleep System". So I put Belleruth back in my CD player, and listening to her velvet voice conjure up images in my mind, was asleep before the end of the CD. I have a very over-active mind, and I basically need something verbal to focus on and distract me.  I've tried "real" music too, like slow classical-type music, with no luck. However I do like Steve Halpern's random music--including his version of "Brahm's Lullaby" and sometimes I can sleep to it.  But "Delta" is not the "change" I need 
 I grew up reading the Chip Hilton books and loved every one of them.  A few years back, Claire Bee's daughter and her husband decided to bring them back, which was a great idea.  Unfortunately, they also decided to update the books.  If you want a great sports book for kids, find the original versions of these books and read them, instead of these updated versions.  You can tell the originals from the fakes by looking at the author's name on each book.  The originals were written by Claire Bee, the fakes are by him, his daughter and others.  One of the things I always enjoyed about the books was that they were written at a time when the rules in sports were quite a bit different than they are today.  In football, for example, if the other team scored you had a choice between having them kick off to you, or you kicking off to them.  The strategies and formations were a lot different too, and of course back in those days people still talked about good sportsmanship and it was important.  The updated books don't make much sense, since they are still using the old strategies and rules, but the books are set in modern times 
 I do not understand why this book is still in print, or at the very least is not published with a huge disclaimer on the front cover.  The author himself has admitted in more recent books (_Blinded by the Right_ and others) that he was *lying* when he wrote this book, and that he deliberately spun every piece of information about Anita Hill to discredit her. 
 I got spoiled with the original Midnight Castle and Escape from Catrina specials when I was a kid. The artwork, songs, voice work and creativity in those two far outshine ANY pony movie or TV show released to date.   This DVD was not worth the $10 I paid for it, frankly. The artwork and animation was horrible, and the plot was terrible. The whole idea of the bees just made me shake my head. And the witches reminded me of Gargamel from the Smurfs.    Even the new Minty Christmas... the ponies have lost some of their charm by making them really bubbly and annoying characters with twitchy habits and nothing much other than fluff and shiny happiness in their lives or average daily problems to solve.   What happened to the dragons? What happened to the castles (The traditional, non-balloony-goofy castles)? And hey, even good villains like The Darkness and his horned minion helps bolster a good show! He really caught my attention, and I LOVED the sequences where the captured ponies got transformed into black dragons. We moved from a Renaissance theme set for the original storyline to this kind of... muddled, weird new-age setting. The Renaissance setting was better. Why the heck don't you release the original Midnight Castle UNEDITED to include all the original songs, and then follow it up with a "Return of the Darkness" or "Darkness Returns" in the original style?? It could work. I'd probably like it a lot better than End of Flutter Valley 
 Kipnis uses her mindlessly wielded implicit racism to make jokes about rape that reinforce the myth that her audience (explicitly white upper middle class women whose money she wants) are raped by strangers (when even ABC news admits that the vast majority of rape victims are raped by people in their own socioeconomic group...who they already know).  She's not accountable to her audience, she's merely profittng from the hyper-spending tendencies that she diagnosis them with.  When I had the disheartening opportunity to discuss the book with her she used every tactic of male chauvinism to dismiss my critique of her book's racism...even to the extent of insisting that since her editor was black she couldn't be racist.   Don't waste your time 
 The author made a huge mistake with this one.  It is so basic, meaning a lack of pictures and good graphics to lower its cost, that it ends up driving no point home at all.  This book is a complete waste of time.  The  only plus is that it is one of the only true general virology textbooks out  there 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 I bought this book because the documentation that comes with Empire at War is so scanty, and unfortunately I must say I'm rather disappointed. The most important bit of info you'll need is a chart telling you the income, trade, value per mine and number of build slots per planet - something that took me about 1 - 1 1/2 hours to research on my own and manually enter in the planet entries. It would have been even simpler to count hardpoints, prices, etc. for the ships and list that up on the various ship entries, or even better, on a 1 or 2 page chart - again, something that would have been very simple and basic for a researcher to have done.  There are some nice tips for the multiplayer game, but I wouldn't depend on them unless you fancy being eaten alive by the other players. Most of the tactical and strategic advice is basic, common sense stuff - get your income up, balance your unit and technology builds, etc - but again, the excellent charts and data tables that one expects in a Prima Guide and that one would use to make such decisions are entirely absent.  Spending an hour or two collating important data like this into the book before publishing it would seem basic to me, but clearly not to whoever put this book out. The fact that it's about a third more expensive than other Prima Guides (probably because the game it covers is a hot Lucas Arts title) doesn't help matters.  All in all, unless you're a collector or have money to burn, I wouldn't bother with it. If you really feel the need to get it, at least check any major bookstore or game shop and read the insides BEFORE you buy it. Because failing to do so is how this particular gamer got took. 
 But, still, don't waste your money. If you must read this, get it from the library and buy a book here from a real American like Al Franken 
  There are just too many errors ,of interpretation,omission and commission,in this book to justify purchasing it.In this review we will concentrate on Rima's(R)handling of the work of J M Keynes.On p.84,R's claim that the Physiocratic concept of hoarding is "surprisingly suggestive" of J M Keynes's idea has no supporting evidence to back it up.On p.133,R claims that Malthus had developed a principle of effective demand,a la Keynes.What Malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and/or intuition that Ricardo's deductive,analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking(or assuming away)the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending.Nowhere does Malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to Ricardo.What Malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with Ricardo.In chapter 20 of R's book, she attempts to deal with Keynes's theory of effective demand and Keynes's discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory.Keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20,titled "The Employment Function".R should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book,replacing her chapter 20 with Keynes's chapter 20.R's Figure 20.1,discussed on pages451-454,directly contradicts Keynes's analysis 
 After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey 
 Price was a factor in buying, but I wanted mostly for slicing bread machine bread. The bit at the end of the blades get hung up in my Presto slicing guide as the blades are too short; further, the switch is extremely temperamental and only works if you move your thumb around a lot. I'd return it, if the postage, packaging and trip to post office were worth it + trying to dig up original cash receipt! These people do NOT want return business! (They've been bought by Salton, so they use this brand for junk 
 Thousand Foot Krutch suck in my opinion.  I bought this CD hoping to find a good band but I found a band I really do not like.  It is just not the type of music I like to listen too.  But it is not good to always base your opinion on people who may not like the same music as you so you should try it out and give it a try i really just dont like it 
 Even the world's greatest living military historian admits to being "mystified" by the Iraq war in his opening chapter.  The following chapters are more in the Keegan style and provide a solid background on Iraq and its place in the region.  Iraq did not provide the sustained episodes of combat that Mr. Keegan may be used to detailing, and hence his work is brought up significantly short, as there are no great tank or infantry battles for him to cover.  His analysis of the war's aftermath is brief and unsatisfactory, especially when that is where the real war began.  Mr. Keegan wrote about his subject too early in its history and the results leave the reader as equally mystified as the author.  Far more highly recommended would be Yossef Bodansky's "The Secret History of the Iraq War", David Zucchino's "Thunder Run", or "Generation Kill" by Evan Wright.   
 This band is a rip off band.....plain and simple....not something NEW....they are ripping off "The Zombies".  I cant believe how easily people are duped...next we'll have some new band playing "led Zeppelin" sounding music and calling IT new....good God in Heaven!!! This is astounding!!! Truly....nothing new here folks and if you want to say they are GREAT go for it but its like a bad hack of "The Zombies".... 
 Joe Carpenter lost his wife and two daughters when the plane they were traveling in crashed. A year later Joe is still grieving, he quit his job, sold his house and is thinking of suicide.  He visits the graves of his wife and daughters to find a woman taking pictures of the graves. He wants to know what she is doing, she says she was on the plane and survived. Men start shooting at her and then start following Joe. He wonders how anyone could have survived the crash.  Joe goes back to visit some of the people who lost love ones in the crash. The greiving family members are happy now that a woman named Rose has visited them. Joe can't figure why they would be so happy. Then the family members start commiting suicide.   Joe decides to go back to the place where is plane crashed since he has not been able to face it before now. He meets a family at a ranch near the crash site. They tell him a woman and small girl visited them the night of the crash and her name was Rose, and she had a small girl with her named Nina. The same name and description of Joe's youngest dead daughter. Could Rose and his daughter be the sole survivors of the crash?  Joe finally meets Rose and she tells him that his daughter is alive, then she tells him the story behind her surviving.  Enter the twilight zone!!!!    I thought that this was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I started to quit reading so many times, but I figured the story would get better. But instead of better with a ray of hope, it got weird, unbelievable, and down right dumb.  The story could have been so much better with a different ending. Most of the things Rose talked about were so out there you had to be a scientist to even comprehend them.  First the book was sad, depressing, hopeful, then weird.  This is the first book of Dean Koontz I have read, I know a lot of people like his books, but I will not read another one. 
 This book is very good until just before the end. There are too many things left unanswered at the end. For example - (1)What was the exact relation between Williams and one of the cousins? (2)When was the microphone placed in the office and by whom? (3)What was the role of the personal secretary in the conspiracy?   ...And many more! 
 I am reading the book "The Westing Game" and I say that this book absolutely awful.  The book has very little details, and the plot is oh, so boring, and I never like this before. The characters names are pointlessly appropriate such as "Crow", "Turtle', and "Uncle Sam". The scenery is bad, and I could imagine better places. The ending was also absolutely terrible in all ways ever. I would rather drink tea from a gutter then read this book again.  The book starts as a pointless scenario and progress to a field of writing horror. I think the author had a huge writers block, and wrote down what ever she could think of first. I don't now how, but Newbery Award. I would have slapped a biohazard sticker to the book just to so how I really think of this book. My summary is that this book is extremely terrible, and should be destroyed.  
 When I first bought this book, I was very hopeful. The book seemed to cover a lot of relevant material, in a concise fashion. When I tried to read it however, I found it a little bit too much on the concise side. I have read very complicated books with a lot of math before, and I could follow them easier than this "easy" writing style. Almost every subject is covered in other books in more detail and better. Sometimes it's nice to have a simpler book which is an introduction, and that is what I was hoping for, but this just didn't do it for me.I donated the book to the library,as I felt I would never really get too much out of it. This didn't stop me from buying Mr. Razavi's "Design of Analog CMOS ICs " and I liked his tutorial in the IEEE Phase Lock Loop book he edited.I know he can do a better job 
 Dr. Dean Ornish is a quack, plain and simple. He is on the advisory board of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which is just a front for PETA. Do an exact phrase google of "The Dietary Delusions of Dean Ornish" to get the skinny on this fool.  If you want to save your life don't waste your time on this book. 
 This was not Miami Vice. It was a cop movie with the same characters as the tv show. I realize they were trying to make an updated version of the show, but they updated it so much that it wasn't the show at all. Fox and Colin were not a goo match up on the screen. It felt like they weren't even in the same movie. 
 1. The author advises the use of templates for process consulting.  This is not a new idea in IT.  Templates are used both in production and process.  Templates of all sizes and shapes are used in writing code, IT project management process, spreadsheet templates for calculations etc.  It is mature to an extent where templates are generated without much hoo-ha and contributed for reuse.  2. The book, in an attempt to be overarching, is stretching itself in early stages where it reviews the economy of the world and the industries in 1 broad stroke.  3. The idea of using templates for consulting is not new and is already being practiced in all nooks and corners 
 I didn't get 20 pages into this book before I said ENOUGH ALREADY GET TO THE PART WITH THE WHALES.  Sheesh.  Maybe the ending is good.  Maybe Ishmael and the whale become lifelong friends and live happily ever after.  I do not know because Mr. Melville wont stop rambling on and get to the POINT.  There is a nice picture of a whale on the cover of my copy anyway so that rates this book as TWO STARS.  The rest is mostly junk.  Back to the drawing board 
 Three composers worked on this album, one of which is the infamous Nobuo Uematsu, and it still turned out pretty flat. I feel ashamed to say that, too, because I've been such a fan of Final Fantasy music, but there just wasn't a whole lot to this soundtrack. A few songs stood out to me, but I really had to stretch my taste to accept them. Nothing on here is bad, though. It's just... not epic, not revolutionary. Doesn't make you cry or want to sing. It's just THERE. Good background music, but you can always find plenty of that. -- One of the composers, Kumi Tanioka, did the entire Crystal Chronicles soundtrack herself. That actually turned out really good, and is much better than this collection of mediocrity 
 I read Death Takes a Honeymoon in two days and the more I thought about the book, the less I decided I enjoyed it.  Were there any likeable characters at all?  The story was very uneven and there wasn't enough development of Julie, one of the most interesting characters.  By the time I got to the cliffhanger ending I decided I didn't really care what happened to Carnegie and Aaron after all.  What I did enjoy was the change of venue to Idaho.  I was disappointed enough in this outing between unlikeable characters and disjointed plot that I am not sure I will continue with the series 
 I remember finding this film fascinating upon its first viewing by me, years ago in New York.  I was much younger then, and at that age, ones early demise always seems so glamorous. Now that I am older and wiser, I found this film, upon a recent re-viewing, only depressing and tragic. Though it is a supposed fictional tale about a former star of the "in-crowd", it is for all purposes a docu-bio of its star, Edie Sedgwick. Edie was , for 15 minutes, Andy Warhol's brightest star. He was enamored of her beauty, patrician family roots, and moneyed glamour, she of his very name, and his offer to turn her into an instant superstar. Their collaboration was brief, and she burned out. Though she grew up in the most privileged of families, there was a horrid hidden life of incest, suicides, and betrayals. Her drug use became one long suicide attempt, until the inevitible event finally occured in 1971. This film is an almost obscene documentation of her demise. Though presented in a fictional setting, it's not very hard to see where Edie's character of "Susan" ends, and the real identity of Edie herself begins. Indeed, the flashback scenes are actual clips of Edie herself, mostly in her Warhol years. But as the film progresses, we see the real Edie  has turned into a monster, she literally seems to be mutating,, and it is sad to observe. Though beautiful, death is painted on her face, and her hesitent and incoherent ramblings are too real. Ultimately, one is very aware of the feeling of exploitation of a very troubled, damaged human being. That she died not long after its filming will surprise no one.  This film, though not a Warhol production, is filmed in the grainy style of his notorious underground films, resplendently amateurish. Though hauntingly presented and scored, it is ultimately a tragic record of wasted life, and very depressing. The creative energy spent by certain parties since her death was an attempt to take a short-cut to the legendary status of a Marilyn Monroe, but this has not happened. Edie has become just a sad footnote to a bygone time, and her handfull of movies, most of which have never and will never be seen by the mainstream, they were not worth the price she paid, though she was arguably doomed long before their making. I would recommend this film only as a fascinating one time view for those who are interested in that crazy time and The Warhol crowd, but anyone other than that will only be bored, perplexed, or saddened  by this tale of poor, lost Edie 
 I've seen the phrase "slice of life" used many times to describe this movie, which makes me wonder - whose life is this a slice of? Certainly not mine, and not most people's. The Anniversary Party is a slice of the lives of a group of people who are extremely vain, self-absorbed, jaded and rich beyond most people's wildest fits of imagination. Worse, there isn't much of a hint that the filmmakers were aware that most people, or at least most people who are fun to be around, don't act the way these characters do.   Good films can be made about Hollywood - in "Mulholland Drive" it's kind of a dream world, both in the sense that it's hazy and ambiguous and in the sense that one of its characters dreams of being a bigger part of it; in "State and Main," the self-absorption of many of the characters is offered for our amusement. "The Anniversary Party" is presented as if most viewers will be sympathetic with the characters, but I can't imagine them elicting much sympathy from anyone who isn't also a bored rich prick. If this is truly a "slice of life" for the Hollywood set, it is no wonder that so many films produced in Hollywood are so cynical and shallow.  
 I am amazed by all the 5 star reviews, how surreal!  No really.  I agree with the 1 star posts. The surreal life on MTV is a bit more, ah surreal.  This movie is far from poignant, well...on second thought 
 Don't make the mistake and buy/rent this movie based on all the 5-star reviews.  This movie is lousy.  It is not funny, but stupid. Do you enjoy movies where the actors talk at you as if you and they were face-to-face? I don't. The comedy is forced (with some interludes that are unrelated to the movie). And then they throw the AIDs theme in there, but they treat AIDs as if it were a joke. Don't waste your money.  Don't waste your time 
 ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)      ((( Insert this every other sentence! )))     figuring out the problem is not hard, its admitting it.     ( hint, dont kneejerk and yell hate and sexist, this is a woman writing, who stays home with the kids and whose own mom stayed home with the kids, rem those days?  the 60's?  oh gee why has everything changed?!  you know the answer, just admit it.      A sense of community  We know all about the women who live along Wisteria Lane, but not what's going on with the people who live on our own street. We instant message with strangers around the world while hardly talking to the neighbor next door. We know the middle names of celebrity children, though we have no idea who the kid across the street is.   It's the American way, or perhaps the demise of the American way.   Fewer people know their neighbors, a decline that's been occurring since the late 1960s, according to the book "Better Together: Restoring the American Community," (Simon & Schuster, $15, 336 pages) by Robert Putnam and Lewis Feldstein.   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     Since that time, social clubs, civic associations, participation in public affairs and time spent with family, friends and neighbors have all dropped by 25 percent to 50 percent, according to the book.   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     And the average American has friends over to dinner about 45 percent less than in the 1970s, according to another of Putnam's books, "Bowling Alone" (Simon & Schuster, $16 paperback, 554 pages).   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     "It does seem to be the kind of thing we have lodged in the collective imagination where the Cleaver family has barbecues with the neighbors," says Kevin Wehr, an assistant professor of sociology at California State University, Sacramento. "That just seems to be not really the case anymore."   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     Busy schedules, a more transient society all contribute to declining neighborliness, experts have found.   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     
 This was a disappointment. It is boring and does not go into the most interesting aspects of the movie Fitzcarraldo which would be;  1) How did they pull the ship over the mountain?   2) how did they have the steam ship go over teh rapids and waterfall? and   3) how did they deal with the wild cannibal/savages/indians.  When the movie touches (very lightly) on these subjects they merely use photos rather than film.  The only good part is in the outtakes when Klaus Kinski has some type of hissyfit with the cameraman.  This film sounds fascinating on paper but it's boring, real boring!  
 In purchasing Delta, I thought that I was going to be able make a lot of money in the stock market since the ups and downs are already locked in. The only way you're likely to make any sort of money from this is in long term commodity futures. Even then, you're still not guaranteed success. I've given this book one star based on the fact that fundamentally Delta is utterly useless when it comes to accurate buying and selling 
 I find it difficult to believe this pedantic, clumsily-written novel is by the same author as the delicious Amelia Peabody mysteries.  Where is the wit, the good plotting?  As outlandish as the Peabody books are, Peters writes so well in them that one gladly suspends disbelief.  This book seems more like the effort of a not-very-talented undergraduate in a creative writing class.  How disappointing! The narrator doesn't help; did she read the book before recording it?  Inflections are inappropriate, the heroine comes across as a ditsy dame, and the male protagonist doesn't seem to know whether he speaks with an accent or not 
 i was extremely disappointed with this dvd, in both content and quality.    i expected a wider range of archival video footage from his preformances and some selections are in fact taken from same performances.  fourteen live performace songs is an extreme understatement of his ability to capture his audiences, be it for a television broadcast or live concert.  the anthology is padded with distracting talking head video footage taken from the documentary and the fades between frames were less then desired.  but... the "bonus" documentary was redeeming.  "half mile a day" is definitely the stronger half of this dvd; perhaps the documentary should in fact be the primary material with the anthology being the "bonus" selection.  i ranked this dvd at two stars because i purchased it for the performance footage and not the documentary 
 Nansook Hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to HyoJin Moon, but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents' machinations to get her married into the Moon family. Eyewitnesses tell of Nansook visiting the Moon household and knowing full well of HyoJin's excesses in advance of her marriage. The Hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the Moon family, and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first Moon daughter, they pushed Nansook to marry a Moon son. Though I don't know all the motives, the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that Ms. Hong has not been honest about. It is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of Rev Moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect, given her own deceit 
 For a reason that completely eludes me, the manufacturer decided to go against the mainstream and glue the flaps on the inside of the envelope.  All other brands are glued on the outside.  The main disadvantage is that CDs are harder to insert into the envelopes: they tend to get stuck between the imperfectly glued flaps and the back of the envelope.  This design also offers less protection to the CD, as the flaps rub harder against it when sliding it in or out, and may even scratch it a bit.  Other than that, the envelopes are okay, but the only reason why you'd buy these instead of the cheaper Fellowes product is the shipping cost 
 What I thought looked like an interesting book about tracking technologies (ie RFID, the proliferation of cameras, software that tracks your every movement) turns out to be a poorly written doomsday scenerio written by hippies.  I should have known something was wrong when I got to the first of many paragraphs that were circular redundant hippie speak questions with no answers.  "Who does the government care about? What are big companies doing with this data?  What is being done to protect you?......"  For the record, nanotechnology research will not "cover the earth in grey goo."  Nor will Starbucks "beam advertising into your brain" when you go in the store.  Terribly written, horrible conspiracy theory crazy talk.  I want the 2 hours back that I wasted reading half of this book 
 I have read every one of Stephen King's books.  This was the only one that I have not read.  I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one.  The style of Peter Straub stinks.  Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about.  Stephen King has finally written a real clunker.  This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read 
 The book contains some useful examples and case studies but overall feels like advertising for author's valuation website. A lot of information is repeated in several places 
 This game is very very hard. The concept sounds cool but i would not recomend to purchas this item. After about the 2nd turn everyone just says this is impossible. Then everyone starts working together, not using the board, not doind the right turn, and looking through all the clue cards. It is not a fun game in my opinio 
 Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews below before I bought this DVD.  It's a travesty of the DVD medium.  Perhaps Fox Lorber took the story of the movie too seriously:  they've produced a disk with the picture and sound quality of a bootlegged copy.  Don't waste your money on it 
 The subtitle is very misleading.Having lived in New England, I love it as much as anyone, but to say the recipes come from across the country is a misrepresentation. Ninety-five percent of the recipes are from NH,CT,and NY. There are a couple from CA and one from another state, but that is it. The recipes are fine, but certainly not what I expected 
 The Winter Prince was amazing. I found myself frustrated with Medraut when he became arrogant and prideful. He refused to ask his father, Artos, for help in battling his evil mother, Morgause. I felt helpless because I could not offer Medraut support. Luckily Medraut begins to change as Lleu begins to trust him. I love the ending where....well I won't tell you that. This  book is really great! It kept me on the edge of seat. The historical attributes help me understand ancient history that had been confusing previously 
 Carlos Mencia is one edgy comedian; I know this because he won't stop telling everyone about it. I've never been a huge fan of Carlos and after listening to this CD my opinion of him hasn't really changed. He claims to be an edgy comedian and that's his problem, if he was truly edgy he wouldn't have to constantly remind us in his CD/DVD titles, his show on Comedy Central, radio/TV interviews and most importantly during his own act. Sure he talks about very racial and socially taboo subjects but so does Chris Rock, George Lopez, David Cross, George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Richard Pryor (RIP) and countless other comedians and they are much better at it. In fact they are so good at it Mr. Mencia often feels to need to use some of these comedian's jokes in his own act, a true sign of respect for those who came before them; at least that's what Carlos seems to think or maybe he's just plagiarizing because he's not funny enough to come up with descent material. Needless to say I was not laughing while listening to this CD and it wasn't because I find Carlos to mean spirited, or crass, or politically incorrect; it's because everything he talks about that's supposed to be so gosh darn edgy has already been said by other people who are much more funny then he is. There is so much good stand up comedy out there people don't waste your time and money on this joke stealing, self aggrandizing hack.  
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 Just a warning - 8 minutes doesn't count warm up, stretching, or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise (something that I find really annoying and ineffecient!).  I have not read Jeorge's book.  I got the routine from an excerpt in O! I don't understand why he doesn't pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing - it's such a pain getting up and down, up and down.  Plus, I feel like you lose that whole idea of "no rest".  I'm sure I expend more calories to get up an down, but it's all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself.  I have been following WW while I have been doing the 8m workout (more like 10-15 for me), and I have not lost one pound.  I'll keep doing it, because it's probably better than nothing, but I'm not impressed so far (about 3 weeks) 
 Don't be fooled by the cover. I bought this movie because I am a fan of Ong-Bak and The Protector. As soon as the movie started I was dissappointed. The voice-overs were absolutely horrendous and the captions would not even come close to what you actually heard. But still,I thought, it has Tony Jaa in it so the fighting will probably be good.!!Wrong!! In one of the reviews it says that Tony Jaa was at the end. I never even saw him at any point in the entire movie. As a matter of fact, the pictures on the packaging are from Ong-Bak. On the inside casing it has a picture of Jaa's mentor Rittikrai and on the opposite side it has a picture of him again with Jaa's head pasted on. You can tell because they're wearing the same jacket. A jacket that Rittikrai is the only one to wear in the movie.Tony Jaa's name never even appears in the credits. Unless you like to buy things that are an absolute lie,stay very far away from this product. Hopefully the companies that have been fooled into selling this product become aware of it and seek retribution on the people who fabricated this scam 
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 I love cheesey horror films from the late 60's/early/70's. With that being said I was very dissapointed watching this movie. It's bad. Not bad in a good cheesey way, but bad as in almost impossible to watch. Here are my reasons why:  -The music. My god, I have never heard such wrong music for a movie. When I see people getting killed I know that I want to hear soft James Taylor type music. It added nothing to the atmosphere of the film, and in fact hurt it.  -The editing. I have never seen such bad editing. One moment one of the victims is across a large creek from her attacker, and the next the attacker is on the same side chasing her again. I could go on, but there are so many editing goofs that I would be here all night describing them.  -The screenplay. The situation itself could have been believable if the dialogue , and scenes, had been better written. As it is the entire situation seemed really unbelievable. It makes me wonder how this film ever got made.  -The acting. None of the story was believable because the acting was so awful. As I said before I love cheesey movies. Sometimes that includes bad acting, but when it is combines with the above stated faults it makes it a horrible thing to witness.  The reviewer who said that this is an important horror film has got to be kidding me. Hammer horror films from the same era are important. AP horror films from this era are important. This film? It should be forgotten and avoided at all costs. I knew that there was a reason why I have never liked Wes Craven's movies 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 Michael J Fox stared in a few movies in the 80s about being a yuppie in New York.  While in The Secret of My Success he was a lovable yuppie scum from Kansas, here he is a not so lovable yuppie scum from Kansas who is absorbed in the heady nightlife of cocaine and all that was New York in the 80s.  He is in despair, as his job is going downhill, his wife has left him, there are no friends to be found, and it's all falling apart.  It's hard for me to feel sympathy for someone like this.  He made choices to live this way.  His use of drugs was not the result of abuse, desperation or being forced into doing something he didn't want to do, it was the result of his own choices.  His wife left him because she doesn't want to watch him go down.  His friends are not really his friends, and he is loosing footing with his job.  "What? Me? Get up and go to work? I don't like the way you said that, I'm not going."  And the coke straw says "You know you're right."  Michael J Fox seems to be someone who has had a lot of advantages in life and he is throwing them away for the next high.  I've watched many friends ruin their lives with this, and none of them are my friends anymore because of their choices.  I choose to live in happiness, to be in the light, and to be responsible enough to support myself.  Guess what?  That's cool and they're not.  Why not one star?  In terms of a cinematic achievement, they were able to capture the paranoia and upset that is cocain addiction so the audience is able to experience it for themselves.  A few movies have been able to achieve this, such as Good Fellas and Boogie Nights, and this movie for that alone has fallen into the slush pile.  Michael J Fox had his own addictions he was able to overcome, I wonder what happened to a lot of those people this movie was about from the 80s 
 I like this story.The writer wrote people's mien very carefully. I make me feel seemingly I was in the story. It described a poor young woman and a man,they loved each other,they both bought a present to each other,and they  used different ways. The same thing was they both sold their things to by  the present. So, though they didn't have much money,their mental world was  rich 
 It seems to be a thinly veiled attempt to capitalize on the success of the Da Vinci Code. And just in case you missed it, there are several references too! The plot is wafer thin....who on earth would expend money and effort to simply chase a 4000-year old dream? All situations seemed to be too easily contrived and coincidental. Traps built several thousand years ago continue to work with the efficiency of a Swiss watch. Reilly thinks he's writing to a bunch of school kids.....exclamations, sound effects and hyphenated actions abound! Too obviously, the protagonists (Lily and West) have genius-level IQs and crack codes like you and I would crack our knuckles. The heroes have unfettered access to almost everything. Save yourself money and time .... stay away from this book 
 Should you be afraid of your microwave oven? This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, "Have you fed your baby breakfast today?" then you may like this book.   Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love. The other book I highly recommend is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_, which has terrific & reasonable advice you won't find elsewhere. By those two, not this one. 
 I bought this believing that it was chalked full of "full length" videos of the sweet performing. Instead we get three very boring men discussing a very small amount of information on the band. The three men consist of one of the song writers, the guitarist and an early manager. The song writer has more gravel to his voice than Tom Waits, the guitarist is sadly very bloated, and the manager is slouched on a sofa wearing khaki shorts complaining about how the band should have gotten into arena rock. (He's the worst of the three!)  Just as I was enjoying "wig wam bam" when the video cuts off and back to the chat! No little Willy video at all! They also don't include more than 30 secs of the  "love is like oxygen" video. That's sick to fool the fans into thinking they're buying a music video/concert dvd when it's simply a lame documentary. Don't buy it, watch the videos of youtube or buy a dvd from the UK.  
 I bought this CD not long after it came out.  It didn't last long in my collection because it only has a few good songs on it!!!  I like Somehow Our Love Survives and Abandoned Garden.  Other than that this is a mediocre effort for Michael. He has used this kind of Brazilian theme on Sleeping Gypsy already. Stick with your roots Michael...you are from California...not South America. Try buying Blue Pacific instead!!! I abandoned this one a long time ago 
 I'm sorry, I just had to include that in the title of my review. Anyway. This book is...odd. That is the best one word to describe it. It is random, and the sentences, if you can call them that, seem to be strung together by a kindergartener. I like to compare this book to one throwing a bucket of paint against a wall and watching the droplets of liquid trickle down in odd patterns. It is not a BAD novel, per say. I can totally imagine this book being read in a dark room at a poetry slam, with a small crowd of twenty-somethings drinking and reminiscing about high school, a time which seems so far away to them. But if you are a teen reading this on a lazy day with nothing but a book to entertain, you could certainly do better. I wish i could explain the plot to you. I really do. But, alas, I can't. I can only grasp that it is centered around a high school writer named Zoe, with a penchant for homosexuals. It also includes a LOT of curse words, and strong subject matter. I would not read this if you are under 15 or are sensitive to these things.  The plot makes no sense, and it is written in a very odd form. The writing is clearly written by a teenager, and an extremely angsty, very probably self-centered one at that. This is a last-minute read, if you are desperate, or if for some odd reason you want to remember the days you cursed at your mother and questioned your sexuality. 
 I can't believe that anyone would believe this nonsense! This is the kind of book that may be praised by homosexuals who are trying to convince us that perverted behavior is good instead of evil, but it belongs in the trash with the rest of the garbage 
 This program was BORING! As much as Billy tried to keep the kid on the program motivated, about 10 minutes into the workout they were showing how bored they were, and of course my kids at home, and I'm sure any other kid picked up on this, and soon lost interest. Several things made this program boring: One, you can't understand a thing Billy is saying, he would mumble unclear phrases thoughout the entire program, and his demeanor was very un-natural, to the point of being fake. He just looked & sounded very out of place working with kids. It came across like he & his crew weren't really sure how to interact with the kids, making them appear to be very fake. Another boring point was the movements, there was absolutely NO creativity here, these were some of the EXACT same movements from the adult Tae-Bo videos. Now, I do applaud Billy for slowing the movements down (unlike the adult Tae-Bo which goes at a break neck pace), these movements are performed in a controlled manner. But, they are still adult type movements, and extremely boring for kids. I would have liked to have seen some creativity with these movements to make them more kid friendly, and more EXCITING! To be honest my kids were turned off & bored with this program after the first 10 minutes. Something Billy needs to realize is, kids are smarter than people give them credit for being. - They can tell when someone is being fake & not truly having fun, and they also realize that when kids on T.V. are bored & not having fun, then this isn't something they want to do. Kids want to have fun, and want to watch the instructor & other kids having fun. That is how you motivate children 
 I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as "national character"? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the "inside view"--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian "character" is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you 
 I live in the ghetto(because the darkest blacks live there), am insecure about my nappy hair, will not climb the corporate ladder as swiftly as my light skinned peers, when choosing a mate I will desire a light skinned husband so that I can dip into a lighter gene pool, and finally, if I had to adopt a child I would REQUEST a light skinned one quicker than a dark one.  Slave talk, all of it!  I read this book (most of it) with a completely open mind and hoping for a well researched and fair study of black america's color complex. I ended up throwing this book across the room in frustration. This book perpetuates the myth more than black america. As a dark skinned female I felt horrible reading this, mothers don't let your babies read this, it can be SERIOUSLY detremental to ones development. In all honesty I can say with much authority (after all I have been black all of my life) that the very vast majority of black people do NOT think like this. I find it very hard to believe that it's no more than a coincidence that the authors are the two who benefit the most from the "color complex", a light skinned female and a dark male (because according to this book light skinned men lack the all important street credibility and dark skinned women are bitter and unattractive).  This is a disgraceful portrayal of what could have been a pivotal cultural study. Shame on them for perpetuating the myth 
 Advice is ok, but the photographed kitchens easily cost $200,000 or more.  Not everyone has 25 foot vaulted ceilings with views or $15k Viking stoves.   If your planning on designing a masterpiece and live in Malibu or Manhatten, then this is your book.  If your like me, and will end up at Lowes, you may find "Kitchens That Work" by Edic more interesting 
 If you're new to graphics and Java, this is not a useful book. The first example did not work as displayed in the text and I could not figure out why. Lots of code, very little explanation. I skipped to chapter 3 and discovered the author had switched to applets, but without the required start and stop methods. That example wouldn't run. After a few hours it was clear why the book is not very thick. There is very little explanation. Very frustrating for someone just getting started. Pick another book. (Fortunately this one was cheap. 
 We were very disappointed with this toy that we bought as a gift for a friend's baby. The daughter absolutely loves it, but the suction does not work at all. It is really too bad, because it would be perfect for a high chair toy 
 My ownership of this camera was brief.  First, you must know I love Nikon.  I have 2 other Nikons--an old Cooplix 2200 and a Coolpix 5700.  They have wonderful lenses and give great pix.  I thought my experience with this model would be similar.  NOT!~  From picture numero uno, the lens cover refused to completely open and cooperate.  I got pictures, yes, but they had lazy black eyelids on each corner where the lens cover had not opened up to clear the lens.  What a dissappointment!  I traded it in for a Canon A520 and am happy with that camera.  I suppose it is just what it is.  If I'd saved and spent a lot more money on a D50 or Rebel, who knows?  Anyway,  that is my sad tale with the Nikon 4800 
 Started listening to BT when Four was released.  Have purchased every studio album since then. Consider Straight On ... to be an overlooked masterpiece. Have been happy with every BT purchase ... 'til now.  I find five of the songs listenable, and the rest to be pretty much noise.  I can only hope that the band enjoyed it 
 I was disappointed to read this book. Nye basically argues that the world has become very complex due to the global information age and that even though the US will remain as the world superpower in the coming decades, it is in its best interest to pursue multilateralism instead of unilateralism (altough he recognizes that "at times we will have to go it alone").   It's really hard to argue with Nye's argument, because on paper it sounds very true. Unfortunately, this book does not address the practical matters of foreign policy in the first decade of the XXI century.   I bought this book expecting to find a practical, matter-of-factly counterpoint to the one spoused by the neoconservatives. I had previously read "Of Paradise and Power" (R.Kagan) and "The Threatening Storm" (K.Pollack). I wanted a counter-argument but I did not find it. I am still looking 
 Any one who is a fan of Luther Vandross will be sorry if you purchase this CD.  It's not a tribute.......it an abomination 
 oh, mr siegel, where is your editor, and why must you insist on ruining perfectly interesting characters with meaningless reflection, soporific tangents, and, the worst offense of all, tom robbins-like cutesiness.   Stick to the darkness, the bottle, the raw sex-leave the clever-than-thou  schtick to the wanna be modernists. What a wast 
 Only to be used if you want to learn to converse a bit in Japanese. I used this for couple weeks- and I found that "Japanese Step by Step : An Innovative Approach to Speaking and Reading Japanese " is a better option. 
 This book reminds me of a false advertisement: pick it up and it sounds interesting, even those first crucial lines pull you in and then... Then we are pulled along on a tortuous journey into a writer's ego.  This book is written in the kind of style that you want to be beautiful, even lyrical - Instead it's more often confusing.  By page 17 I was skipping forward in hopes that it became more compelling.  There is a languid air to Mr. Jordan's writing, which is fine as long as we care about what happens or why.  Why the main character is killed by her childhood friend (no suprises, we know the killer's name on page one)is perhaps the clearest paragraph and half of the book. Unfortunately this doesn't happen until page 268, by then I was just glad to be done with it all.  Mr. Jordan's screenplays are wonderful, but this book is pure self-indulgence.  
 My Lord John - a real disappointment - the book is so steeped in geneological detail on almost every page that it is almost incomprehensible - the main thrust of the story is lost, and the characters become confusing and uninteresting.  Definitely not one of the best of Heyer's work. The book is also unfinished, ending in the moddle of a sentence!  I would NOT recommend this book 
 If you think the Church's history is full of embarrassments and missteps, that American Catholicism reached its peak during the decade of dissent that was the 1970s, that the Gospel is primarily about social justice and not salvation, that wedding the Redemption to Marxism via liberation theology is a good idea, and that the the truths of the Faith concerning celibacy, the all-male priesthood, and human sexuality are mere negotiable propositions, then this is the book for you.  But if you recognize that the Church has been the driving force of civilization for 2,000 years, that her truths are gifts from God, that through her -- His "sacrament of salvation" -- Christ continues to convey grace, and that her best days are ahead of her, then you'll skip this handwringing anachronism of a book and buy Harry Crocker's "Triumph", Thomas Woods' "How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization" or Alan Schreck's "Compact History of the Catholic Church".  To get a sense of the ideological bent of Fr. Bokenkotter, one need only read his eulogy of the late Pope John Paul II printed in the pages of the Cincinnati Enquirer:  "No one has all the answers. Hence the criticisms - some fair and some not - one hears in the midst of all the adulation. While praising the triumphs of democracy in the world, John Paul seemed unable to see the implications for the internal life of the church. In fact, he did little and even hampered the development of collegiality of bishops, which was one of the outstanding merits of the Second Vatican Council.  "Many indeed think his determined effort to root out dissent in the church put a chill on the theological creativity that added such luster to the Catholic Church at the time of the council. There is also the inadequate response to the scandal of pedophilia so tormenting to faithful Catholics. And there was the extraordinary favor he showed to Opus Dei, the originally Spanish organization, that many see as nostalgia for the pre-Vatican Church that offered cheap grace through total conformity to authority. Finally, the pope's unbending stance in regard to sexual and marital morality made many, even devout Catholics, wince."      
 George G.M. Jones knows not a thing about real history. Claiming that the Great Library of Alexandria is where Aristotle took his knowledge is ludacris because the library was built by Ptolemy II. The Ptolemic line was the successor line in Egypt. Alexander, himself was crowned pharaoh by the people because they saw him as a liberator of Egypt. The priests of Egypt viewed him as the son of Zeus. These priests were of the god Ammon who were told at his oracle. The Egyptian Mysterey System was a creation of white men and is a proven hoax. The first Greek philosophers most likely had some knowledge of Babylonian and Egyptian thought they added reasoning, something none existant in Egyptian or Babylonian thought. Even saying that ancient Egyptians were all black is wrong, as the people of Egyptian constituted a mixture of races. They were black and white. They were in fact Semites, like the Jews and Arabs, people who are Caucasian. Skin color alone does not tell a man's race. An Indian from India is in reality Caucasian, making him closer to Europeans than the Japanese or Chinese. Even most the languages of India and Iran are Indo-European, while the Basque live in France and Spain but speak a language isolate. If the Greeks stole anything from anyone it was the Phoneicians and their alphabet, something that is the ancestor to the Greek, Latin, Etruscan, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets. The name Kemet was a reference to the black soil of Egypt. Today it is called Misr anyways.  
 The anaglyph conversions were poor, to put it nicely. (Honestly, I've seen better in TV Guide.) I'm a stereo aficianado, and was quite disappointed that none of the original stereo photos were included. Also, not all of the photos were 3-D, and I found it quite annoying to be putting on and taking off the glasses every third page or so 
 Clearly this product is overrated. In my opinion the book is a complete mess, with definitions, propositions and theorems mixed with the main text and not clearly evidenced from it.  It's funny, because the book uses a panoplia of bolds, italics, etc in the main text (well, there is only main text here) which I dislike and think is unnecessary, and then do not use it to evidence the important results. As a result I think this is probably the worst book that I can remember of for reference.  There are better books and it's almost impossible to get one worse than this one 
 Puhlease folks! This book is filled with the most sophomoric metaphors and turgid prose that is taught at the Iowa Writers Workshop. And people think this is great literature - HAHAHA.  Don't bother 
 I would've given this book 4 stars, but to link the trilobites to evolution this way is very misleading. The whole unbiased scientific community today advocates the "intelligent design theory". I thought that people who hallucinate darwinist pseudo-science only find room for their pens in commercial corporate pages. Use this book for information about trilobites, but use Harun Yahya's books to read about evolution first. They're legally available online for free even 
 I love thunderstorms and rainstorms but that stupid insistent annoying grating freakin' stupid bird chirping chirping chirping chirping chirping..... was driving me up the wall.  Aaaaaahhh!!  How annoying when you're trying relax to the sound of rain.  If only i could remix and isolate that bird and kill it.  Waste of money though its cheap because you won't be playing it again after that bird annoys you.  I give it half a star if could 
 After reading "The Devil Went Down to Austin" I was excited to discover Rick Riordan.  Good writing and well-drawn characters.  Cold Springs was a huge disappointment. The characters were neither very believeable nor were they likeable. Chadwick just didn't ring true and the daughters? -- tell me again why copying Katherine's addictive behavior was so compelling to Mallory? The story was a muddle. 
 I was so excited to get this for my iPod.  I love listening to my music in my car, but was really disappointed when it wouldn't fit into my 2003 GMC Envoy.  There are two cup holders in the front, and granted they are in weird spots, but the TuneDok wouldn't fit.  If I put it in the front cupholder, it would interfere with the gear thing, and if I put it in the back cupholder I had no where to put my cups, plus it interfered with the box.  
 The book had a far-fetched premise, but once I was able to move past that detail, the book was readable, albeit unrealistic.    Without giving away anything significant, I can tell you that a major portion of the book was centered around a police officer assuming an alias.  Unfortunately, I was a little surprised, and very disappointed in the way the author chose to "reveal" the main undercover operation to the criminal.  The unraveling of the cover was brought about by a mistake that I found completely innane.  I could not believe that a rookie, much less a seasoned officer would slip up as the author has Carol (and Tony) slip up.  This disbelief is compounded by the lengths that are taken initially to insure that the operation is not comprimised.  I was disappointed enough in the book to move along to another author, as opposed to reading the rest of the Carol Jordan/Tony Hill saga.  I thought the writing skills of the author were good, but the storytelling skills were not. 
  It's the polar opposite of good writing.  It's so familiar, so conversational, so unturgid, and so padded with fluffy stuff it's unreadable.  Even worse than I figured it would be.  Oh, well, now i know after wondering all these years. 
 what were they trying to teach me?   this book is intermittently funny, more often highly and dryly pretentious and snobbish, but more than anytyhing I find it very very creepy. Towards the end when things start to fall apart for Aimee, Dennis/Waugh achieves a combination of callousness and feeble wit that is so offputting to the sensitive reader, I can hardly believe the book made it to press without a major rewrite of the last few chapters. It would be one thing if it were much much funnier, but most of the "comedy" is of the "lost in translation" variety: nothing but xenophobia and looking down on those beings from a different culture and therefore certainly inferior that populate certain parts of the globe. haha those silly japanese persist in speaking their own language/americans women are all completely interchangable unlike our English roses! Didn't this guy also write "Brokeback Revisited" anyway?  I was totally embarrrased to be seen reading it in public when I took it to dinner with me one night at the little thai place!  the movie is interesting cause john waters certainly got the idea of edie the egg lady from this film (and not from the book. mom is quite different onscreen as conceived by terry southern and c. isherwood.( also liberace is fun, rod steiger is A M A Z I N G.                            
 To start off with, It's hard to start the wipes through the hole in the cap.  You have to take the cap off and then take the foil seal off, then you find the start of the roll.  It's glued down like the start of a roll of toilet paper.  (They say you are supposed to start in the middle of the roll but I couldn't find the middle!) Then you have to feed the wipes up through four very tough plastic tabs in the cap.  The only problem is the hole is small and tabs are not very flexable.  I was honestly afraid my finger was going to get stuck in the hole. (It didn't) I think the safest way to do it is to use a pencil or pen to start them with.  Once I did get them started, the tabs are so inflexable that the first sheet just tore in half no matter how carefully I pulled on it.  So I took the cap back off, started the next sheet.  This one came out in one piece, and tore off the roll, BEFORE THE NEXT SHEET STARTED THROUGH THE HOLE. (grrr) OK, forget feeding the sheets through the hole.  I just take the sheets straight off the roll.  So now I clean my computer monitor, which is pretty dirty.  (It's in a room with 3 smokers)  I can clearly see that it's just smearing things around.  I check the sheet itself.  It looks clean still.  I sit and watch as this filmy substance dries on my screen, with very pronounced, very visable streaks.  I try another sheet.  Still got streaks from hell.  A third sheet later, I can't seem to make the streaks disappear.  They only move around.  I say forget it and clean my moniter the old way.  I say forget this stuff.  It's junk.  Save your money 
 I am glad that Elder recognizes that applying his concepts to short-term trading, such as daytrading, is much harder than applying them to a longer time horizon.   His basic premise is that stocks tend to travel within channels. This is a volatility mean reversion argument, which when taken to its limit essentially argues that volatility does not exist - that stocks do not gap up or down and that when a stock breaks out of or down through its channel, it's automatically a long or a short (in the opposite direction of the respective move).   I couldn't disagree more.   If you apply Elder's concepts to daytrading, for example, you will lose all of your money. I did.  But, if you have a longer time horizon - such as a multi-day holding period, you could very well apply his concepts with some success - just be sure to apply his premise of stocks travelling within channels to stocks that recently FINISHED breaking out of or down through thier channels as opposed to stocks that are in a relatively tight range (primed for breakout). I'm very surprised that Elder doesn't address how volatility mean reversion can easily kill his style of trading if not applied properly to stocks that are consolidating.   In any case, take this book with a grain of salt as it is likely the first important trading book you'll read, but certainly (hopefully) not the last 
 This novel could not hold my interest.  I am an Anne Perry fan, but could not get into this book.  I couldn't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting.   I'm really disappointed, because I was looking forward to a new series by her.  Joseph and Matthew lost their parents to murder and Joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion.  Maybe Ms. Perry tried to tell too many stories within one story.  In reviewing the book, it's hard to pin point exactly why I didn't like this book. I would skip this series and read the Pitt series.   
 unfortunatlly i got a dvd that dosnt work.... he lagnguge is not english and when i tried changing and choosing english lang. it dosnt repond... so am stuck with i 
 Jack kornfield just doesn't know how to compose a sentence with any flair. He also makes unwarrented assumptions about how the world works and never defends them rationaly. The man doesn't have a critical bone in his body. This is just another example of nonsense that get published in the buddhist community and eaten up by unthoughtful readers. TERRIBL 
 The first novel of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. It's by far the best in a not particularly great series, actually. What made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things I've ever read.   Princess Meredith NicEssus has fled Faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Unseelie Court. High profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock stars or the royal family of England. The sudden disappearance of one of the Unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. Every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. We are told solemnly that reports of Princess Meredith being spotted are right up there with Elvis sightings. Meredith's image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere. I mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest Africa know who Meredith is, and what she looks like.   Meanwhile, Princess Meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. Thing is, she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. Her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. Her fae red hair is now human red hair. Her facial features remain the same. And with everyone on the planet wondering where is Princess Meredith, for years on end, no one recognizes her. Let me hasten to add, there is no magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her. And the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually Princess Meredith is....wait for it....Merry Gentry.   Jesus wept.   And for years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to themself, "Hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost exactly like Princess Meredith....Merry Gentry....Princess Meredith....oh my God, Merry Gentry is Princess Meredith!" Nope, she's just incognito, baby.   At which point I almost threw down the book and said, "You have GOT to be kidding me." It's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. Do Laurell Hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? Given her past six or eight novels, including this one, I'm tempted to say: no, actually 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 What a waste of time. This was like sitting through a very boring business course. I was never interested in turning the page. I would have liked to see more of Carly personal side and maybe some human aspect to this story.Instead I felt like a robot was telling this story.Very much of how great her business style was and very little about anything else. I forced myself to finish this. A huge diaappointment.Don't waste your money 
 Thank goodness my company paid for this book.  In no way is it worth more than $100.  Consideringing that every other page is a notes page, you effectively get a 60-page book.  Exclude the related information (ex: sales questions, presentation tips) and maybe 15 pages of this book actually relate to writing a proposal.  I have read most of the books out there on developing proposals and any of them are better than this one at helping you develop a proposal.  And they cost a tenth as much 
 I don't know if we are just a strange a-typical family, but this whole daddy and me book was based on things that only mommy can do in our house- daddy doesn't even have any tools. I love Karen Katz books, but this story simply made us cringe. If you are a father who has a son and like to do stuff with you tools in the garage, then this book is for you 
 I'll be honest, the last three novels have me thinking that Patricia Cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name- the "voice" the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels, and its very frustrating. Leaves a dedicated reader feeling like she'd been attacked by the pod people or something!  I hold firm to the idea that she hasn't been writing these novels. There is just no way 
 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 The stories are mediocre at best, there is no answer key for the grammar exercises and the price is astronomical.  The paperback book weighs in at 150 pages and is priced at $41.00!  Absolutely ridiculous 
 This high chair was great to start, but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals. I thought it was me, at first, not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp.   Reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now, 3 months later, she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor. I am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground.   If you are looking for a chair to last you into toddler-hood and your child learns quickly, don't buy this one. I am looking for a replacement before my daughter hurts herself 
 This book was not at all what I had expected or hoped.  I thought it was a scientific look at paranormal phenomena, but this was not that at all.  It's not that the book is badly written, or that it's uninteresting and without merit, but it's nearly 200 pages of Mr. Moody's thoughts and research on the history and definitions of the paranormal and the groups of people who are interested in the paranormal and why they are interested.  I wasn't interested in reading a thesis of the Paranormal and the Men and Women who love it.  If you are the kind of person who loves to tear things apart and study them piece by piece you will enjoy this book very much.  I bought a book about NDE's, apparitions, and the paranormal and I got a thesis on the history of the paranormal and why people are interested.  Regardless of how well thought out Mr. Moody's ideas are, and regardless of how accurate these ideas may be, this book is not at all what I expected.  It's my own fault, the back cover clearly states what this book is about.  But I saw the words "paranormal," and "NDE's" and figure the book was about those things.  The back cover is somewhat misleading, however, about this new NDE phenomena that he calls an "empathic near death experience."  Moody hardly does more than mention it really.  I was terribly disappointed.  Moody is not the first author to bring this phenomena up, either.  Oriah Mountain Dreamer talks about her experience with this in her book "The Invitation."  Hers is a first person account of an empathic near death experience, although she doesn't give it a name.  I learned as much or more about it from her in her book than from what Moody talks about in his.  The Last Laugh is prefaced by Neale Donald Walsch, which is why I bought this book in the first place.  How wrong I was!  I won't be trusting Walsch's judgment on books anymore.    Another problem I had with this book was the way the author seems to delight in bashing Christian Fundamentalists.  While I understand the sentiment, I thought it was in rather bad taste.  Neale Donald Walsch is a huge proponent of religious tolerance, I'm surprised he added his seal of approval to this book.  Perhaps he felt that as Christian Fundamentalists are religiously intolerant by definition that the CF bashing in this book was fair play.  To be fair, Moody does take the time to warn Christian Fundamentalists not to read past a very specific point because they aren't going to like what follows.  And he's right, they won't.  In summation, don't buy this book if you are hoping for a scientific look at NDE's, apparitions, and the paranormal.  Do buy this book if you would like to read a thesis on who is interested in the paranormal and why 
 This may be an effective, helpful book; however, I could not make it through the first chapter as a result of the countless references made towards Christian values and God.  Let me say that I have absolutely nothing against a person who wishes to preach the word of God.  On the contrary, I am encouraged by those who believe this is their calling.  Unfortunately, I did not purchase this book to be inspired; I purchased this book to understand the author's perception of valuable communication skills.  If this book were titled, "Communication Plus:  How to be a Good Christian Speaker so People Will Listen" I would better understand the author's perspective 
 BOOKLIST claims that "buried within every true baseball fan is a Nerd with a calculator and a scorecard" - a statement mildly amusing if not deeply offensive to 80-90% of the nation's dedicated baseball fans. There  is far, far more to this beautiful game than mere number-crunching. Try  poetry, drama, romance, myth, legend, simple competitive excitement. This  book seems to miss the other 80-plus percent of the game and those other  80-plus percent of the readers and fans. And even for those who would  rather sit in front of their computers than in the outfield bleachers, the  author's measure of hitting greatness is at best the most narrow possible  measure - the standard but highly unrevealing category of batting averages.  There is much ado about nothing here 
 I was bored with this book.  The end was terrible, and the relationships never really evolved.  The plot took place to late in the book, with nothing happening in the end.  I don't recommend this book. If I would have paid more than $6.99 for this, I would have been mad 
 I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided. 
 I have been using Turbo Tax since 1998, I use computers every day, and (as an engineer) I am used to using difficult applications (Pro-E, Mathcad, UG, etc). This years edition of Turbo Tax Deluxe was the worst Turbo tax I have ever seen (& I usually like it very much). I purchased in January and had to update 4 times. One update took 6 hours (some of us live in the boonies and broadband is not an option). In addition, the application brought up menus and selections that were not applicable (farm income at the PA State form). When I tried to delete the entries (at the Federal level as instructed) they would not. My 1 business expense entry kept getting duplicated ("copy 2" and every time I deleted it, it would reappear on the next pass through. Every time I entered the "State" tab, it acted like I was never there before with a "Start State" button that always lead me through all the same questions (It did retain my answers from prior visits). Where was the "Continue State" button? I also noticed that using the "back" button and then moving foreward again caused never before seen dialogs to occur, even though the same "foreward" choices were made. Once I backed up to check something & then moving foreward caused my state tax status to jump from +$46 to -$1548!! Upon backing up I saw that some of the check boxes regarding the sale of my home were unchecked. I did not check them, but rather backed up two more screens, then moved foreward again the two screens and the boxes were again checked! One more foreward click and my taxes again returned to +$46. One of the years I liked best was when there was a "checklist" so you could see where you had been and what was already addressed. This years State was definetly worse than the Federal, but even that was a dissapointment. I did complete this years filings & submitted both online, I hope I don't get burned! Turbo Tax!-- Please improve for next year or it may be my last year. You realize that at 59.95 + 39.95 filing + my time + aggravation like this year, and an accountant is looking attractive. If you are on the "inside" you probably know why this is happening...outsourcing code gen to India, not  outsourcing code gen to India, programmer cut-backs, programming application changes, archiving application changes, project management issues, whatever. Just realize that there is a problem & fix it 
      Ya, sure Mandela is a great person, a personification of a accumulation of moral and ethical supremeness, but lets face it, this book sucks.  I had to read this for a high school english class, and it bored me to death.  So many facts, so many potentially useless information, its as if Mandela intentionally tried to put emphasis on the less entertaining portions in his life.  Personally, I dont see how all the other commentors could stand finishing this book.  Good story...badly written 
 I don't like the index in the front of the book. The headings of the units that the book is organized into are kind of cryptic. It's hard to find what you are looking for. Some of the monologue selections would be poor choices for contest or auditions. They wouldn't appeal to every kind of judge or director. There still are some great pieces though, so I had to give it 2 stars 
 It was mostly about her family and they are not that interesting 
 I wanted to see a romantic and touching movie.  This movie is contrived. The character that Reeve plays acts like a star-struck groupie.  Personally, I don't find his behavior to be romantic.  He seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him.  This is not romantic to most women nowadays.  He is not suave in the role he is playing.  It seems like a cheesy 70's contrived romance that does a bad job of it 
 These things are just getting worse. Why do I buy them?   The first hint should be that the back of the book names the main character as "Nick Hadley" and throughout the actual novel the main character's name is "Jeff Hadley". Is the publisher paying any bit of attention to these books?  The book is about a man who is stranded on an island after Oceanic Flight 815 crashes there. The characters names are the same. However that is where the simularity with the show of Lost ends. None of the characters act or talk like themselves and the author can't decide if the caves are somehow an evil place where no one goes or if some of the castaways live there.  There really should be a rule that if you write a Lost novel you need to actual watch the show. It's a popular show, how hard can it be to find a halfway decent author to write these things?  I don't recommend buying this book. The only reason why they can get away with such poor quality is because they stamp the word "Lost" on it and stupid fans like me buy it. Don't be like me 
 This book will not address what is really going on in the evolution debate.  The current forced, one-sided, and fascist teaching of evolution theory as fact, is nothing more than a world wide conspiracy, the purpose of which is, underneath it all, to deny the possibility of God. To those who consider themselves educated, try reading, for example, "The Evolution Cruncher" by Vance Ferrell (evolution-facts.org).  After you have read and thought through what is contained in this book, THEN tell me you still believe in the fairy tale of evolution! And the book only costs $5 because the author wrote it for it's informational value and not for profit 
 John Gray is no fan of Voltaire or the Enlightenment. After reading Will Durant's  '' The Story of Philosophy '' I was anxious to learn more about Voltaire. According to Gray he was not politically correct or multicultural enough to get our modern stamp of approval. So far I have read several of the ''Great Philosophers Series'' and all have been poorly written or boring. I will not purchase any more. The story of philosophy is actually very exciting 
 The pleasure of Plato is as much from his literary as from his philosophical acumen. The choice of the public-domain Jowett translation is unhappy for bringing out the literary merit of the original. This Victorian prose, while usually competent as translation, does not ring true to the original and certainly does nothing for the late 20th century American ear. One wonders why the set is so expensive when the translation was had for nothing. And why doesn't Amazon print the contents of these cassettes in their bibliographical information. Does one have to buy the set to find out exactly what its contents are&gt 
 This movie is trash.  It's a sorry excuse for a home video soft porn flick, and a bad one at that.  Save your money, don't bother 
 This book is a worthless exploration of the city through the dubious analytic framework utilized by Mike Davis in "City of Quartz."  What separates that book is Davis' intimate familiarity with Los Angeles as a lifelong resident.  Whereas D'Eramo is an Italian who's polemic is as cliched as any other European assessment of America which comfortably embraces false stereotypes and broad generalizations about american urban culture.  What mystifies me about these modern marxist urban theorists is they vilify modern american cities, yet ultimately believe that cities provide the best social mechanism for engineering their normative philosophies.   anyway, none of this is to imply that Chicago is immune from criticism.  It is, as is any city.  It's has a sordid history of racism, corruption, an dubious institutional choices.  But any comprehensive analysis of Chicago that refuses to recognize Chicago's virtues or at least attempt to understand Chicago on Chicagoans terms is intellectually bankrupt and a worthless read. If you want great polemic pick up the works of the great chicago polemicists Algren and Royko, not the work of this Italian Huckste 
 In many ways, D&D 3.0 and 3.5 incorporate CONCEPTS that are excellent for a role-playing game -- more flexibility in creating your characters, more options, more customization, and logical shortcuts such as having Armor Class higher as it improves, requiring a higher to-hit roll, rather than the hideous system of THACO.  However, the EXECUTION of those concepts is horribly muddled and mismanaged. There are three main problems with the system as it stands:  1. There are so many modifiers which modify other statistics, rolls, and so on, and those modifiers spawn other modifiers in turn, and there are modifiers from abilities, skills, feats, size of creature, etc., etc., etc., that it becomes a true nightmare to keep track of everything that could potentially modify a single die roll. This applies to creating NPC and monster stat blocks, too -- it's necessary to keep a separate sheet of scratch paper and reference all three core books to roll up even a 1st-level monster, for example. And even then, it's possible to make errors which will only be found out in play. Information on everything that can modify ANY statistic or ability can be scattered in 5, 6, or more places in multiple books, WITHOUT any indication of where to find that information (so you'd best have it all memorized beforehand). You can literally spend hours trying to figure out the stats and abilities for a single unimportant NPC.  2. The tactical wargame aspect of combat. It's impossible to run a battle without using miniatures or counters, unless you throw away most of the combat rules -- and if you do that, why use the book most of the time? The complexity also shows here -- once again there is a host of modifiers, meaning you have to flip back and forth between the equipment, feats, and combat chapters to make a single roll -- and that's assuming that there's no magic involved. Again, it's a bookkeeping nightmare, and after a while, the counters/miniatures thing REPLACES any kind of visualization or description.  The battle no longer takes place in your imagination, but shrinks to the abilities of a bunch of chits, basically.  3. The mind-numbing, ledger-like uniformity of many approaches to game events in Third Edition, where the game is BALANCED AROUND predetermined mathematical formulae -- for example, you're SUPPOSED to have 4 combat encounters per day, no more, no less. If you have less, the PCs will be insanely overpowered in the encounters they do fight in. If they have more, then they'll probably die.  Saying "you have to design every adventure around having 4 battles every day, no more, no less, or the balance of the system will be destroyed totally" -- tells me that there IS no balance. It's like saying your car will run adequately as long as you drive it exactly 20 miles every day at precisely 22 MPH -- that, to me, is not a well-designed car, even if it does run perfectly when you do stick to those predefined and very specific limits.  To sum up, the new system is a bookkeeping exercise whose elegant basic mechanic is destroyed by huge masses of cross-referencing between multiple books .... whose combat system is a tactical wargame that is just as bureaucratic as the rest of the system .... and which can only work in a balanced way if you build arbitrary numbers (like 4 battles per day, without fail) into your game sessions.  I almost forgot to add that the extreme emphasis on math and the very flexibility of character creation seems to encourage a mindset in players which treats the game as a tactical wargame or video game. I'm a video gamer myself, but when I want to play a video game, I'll do so. Pen and paper RPGs are supposed to be a bit more tilted towards telling a story together, even if there's a lot of rolling. However, you can often find yourself involved in discussions of "optimal party composition" or "feat and skill allocation among party members," in which the whole focus of the game becomes creating an optimized group of killbots and skillbots, instead of starting with a character and party concept and going from there. There have always been many, many min-maxers, but a side effect of this new system seems to be that more thought is devoted by the average player to an "optimal party/character build" in the mathematical terms -- talk about something that will inevitably kill any sense of adventure or wonder in the fantastic setting.  Metagame thinking can easily destroy any sense of roleplaying or even FUN, and it seems, from what I've seen at least, that this is exactly what happens most of the time. "Why are you playing a paladin -- a druid can bring a lot more skillz and powerz to the table than that loser!!!"  ....Uh, maybe I happen to want to play a paladin because that's the kind of character storyline I want to pursue.... or a warrior, or whatever. RPGs aren't supposed to be about building the optimal character, they're supposed to be about letting you play the character you want to through more or less fantastic adventures -- without worrying constantly if you've maximized his/her mathematical utility to the die-rolling of the party.  A clumsy, dull, adventure-killing, bureaucratic, confused, clunky, rules-heavy, depressing mess that offers a superb promise of streamlining and flexibility, but goes on to trample it with Boots of Soul-Killing Bookkeeping +5. 
 The wrong item was sent. There are 2 items with the same title. Advances in Economic Theory I and Advances in the Economic Theory II. The description of the book was very vague and I was unaware of the existence of two version up until I received it 
 It was okay. The acting wasn't all that great and neither was the story line. I did like how April's mother came around so fast and was more concerned about her daughter being happy rather than who she was with 
 As Hamlet is Bloom's god one would have expected a more generous bible. Instead this is one of Bloom's most disappointing books, filled with the hot -air of exaggerated praise unjustified by  argument or evidence. This is Harold Bloom at his most -declarative placing Hamlet above and beyond all literary- and one would dare to say- human characters.  It is also quite a paltry text, padded with quotation. And it assumes a critical knowledge of Hamlet which I venture to say only few of even its most devoted readers and spectators possess. As there is a whole critical literature built on the subject of Hamlet's delay in executing his father's request for vengeance I thought that Bloom would in some meaningful way address this. The Hamlet of passion, of passion for Ophelia also, of passionate involvement with the deepest questions of meaning in life is somehow absent here. Instead we have a more detached playing and playful Hamlet, cruel to the point of testing our sympathy. In short 'the Hamlet' Bloom reads and worships is far from the Hamlet of most Tradition. And is far from the Hamlet whose tormented existential questionings have so enthralled so many readers through the generations. Instead of augmenting the name of Hamlet ,Bloom has perhaps made a minor wound in it- though of course Bloom is right in knowing that this character is too 'immortal' to really be wounded by any single critic, however important or great 
 I do not care for this book at all.  I didn't find any of the tips and shortcuts to be for anything I use after effects for (special effects).   I don't have an answer as to what book I will purchase next, but save a tree and pass this one by 
 How come they edited the first opening riff on Jet Airliner, I really like that alot. I dont know, I dont like this band and theres only 3 good songs. Take the Money and Run, Rock N Me, Jet Airliner, too bad they eddited that. Buy book of dreams and waste your amount of money on it and listen to the Jet Airliner on it, it's much better. The Joker is one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my lifetime. That's what makes this compilation sucks the price!! LISTEN to the Dire Straits insted.  "Telegraph Road" "Heavy Fuel" "Money for Nothing" "Skateaway" "Sultans of Swing" "So Far Away" "Walk of Life" "Industrial Disease" "Calling Elvis" "Romeo and Juliet" "Down to the Waterline" "Solid Rock" "Private Investigations" "Expresso Love" "Brothers in Arms"   
 I'm in a good mood today, and feeling generous -- hence the two stars. Secrest learned that Rodgers could be a rotten person, that he drank and was a womanizer. She then proceeds to beat us over the head with it at great length. I didn't count the words, but it seemed like she spent more time on that then she did on Rodgers and Hammerstein -- not to mention the post-Hammerstein years. We learn nothing about how these shows came about and what happened to them beyond the most cursory; it's if her research there was limited to the notes on the cast albums. I've kept most of my theater books, except for this one. It went to the used book store 
 In the dust jacket, the book purports to let "Justice Scalia speak for himself" and it sounds fairly neutral, praising his prose more than anything else.  Unfortunately, it quickly becomes clear this is more of a conservative love-fest, and at book's end, there is no longer any pretense at objectivity.  Example: "In Scalia's America, freedom, democracy, and diversity would flourish...."  Okaaaay.  There is no serious criticism of Scalia's opinions anywhere in the book.  Which would be fine if this were truly a book that simply let Scalia speak for himself.  But it isn't.  Ring sings his praises at every turn, defends him against all his critics, and can seemingly find no fault with anything Scalia has ever said or written.  Many of Scalia's opinions in the book are actually very compelling, and he does have an acerbic wit.  I found myself in complete agreement with Scalia in the ADA/PGA Golf Tour case, and I agreed in principle on his Affirmative Action and Death Penalty stances.  So I'm not knocking this book because I dislike Scalia or his opinions.  I simply think the book is operating under false pretenses.  When we get to Freedom of Speech, Ring mentions in passing that Scalia voted to uphold flag-burning as a form of speech, but doesn't explain how this passes Scalia's "originalism" test.  Did Congress have flag-burning in mind when it adopted the First Amendment?  If not, is there support for it in the country's legal and social traditions?  If not, then how is it protected under "originalism"?  Scalia avoided the question by silently joining the majority opinion.  I'm guessing Ring avoided it because it didn't fit his conservative agenda.  Ring was more eager to discuss Hill v. Colorado, a case where abortion protestors were also claiming freedom of speech.  Ring characterized their "speech" as nothing more than "oral protest," "counseling," and "education" on the sidewalks outside abortion clinics, neglecting to mention that some anti-abortion protestors would "yell, thrust signs in faces, and generally try to upset the patient[s] as much as possible," would surround patients and scream at them, and so on.  Now, perhaps that behavior is irrelevant and should be protected the same as polite, respectful speech.  But by glossing over that behavior, Ring and Scalia do a disservice to the argument.  Ring implies that Scalia is the only Justice on the Supreme Court to have a consistent judicial philosophy, that he is "unique".  In fact, Ring uses the word unique so much that Scalia must be UNIQUELY unique.  Does this mean that every one of the other eight Justices has no philosophy, is not unique, and is somehow less rational or less responsible, simply because they haven't publicly beaten their own drum?  The answer is buried in their opinions, so until someone does a more balanced analysis, Ring's assertions need to be read with a healthy skepticism 
 why is this the second book in a werewolf based series? ross was only a suporting charater and really only a tool the author used to bridge the gaps in the story so she could get back to the smut.. as a werewolf fan and not a romance fan i wished i just skipped this book and gone straight to the 3rd book. i've read all 3 books already and you can safely skip the second book and go to the 3rd and not miss much at all. the 3rd basically fills you in enough about the second book that even if she writes a forth with charaters from the second book you could still understand everything 
 This book was loaned to me by an acquaintance who borrowed the book from the library and thought I'd like it because I'm from SF and I'm edgy. Whatever.  Okay so Beth Lisick is cooler than you. And she's gonna pound that into you over and over again so you KNOW it. She was cool just out of diapers. She "hung out" with her babysitter who was a hippie! Her parents were so "square" that they were cool! (Hey, it's hip to be square, remember?)  And she has an astounding memory. She can remember-at age 4--that it was on a Thursday that something in particular happened. Right.  She's so cool that she was a track star AND homecoming queen, er, princess...but it didn't matter to her, because she's so cool, you see. So she wore an ugly dress because she was too cool to care. Right.  She's so effin cool that when she works with some nuns at a charity auction and they aren't paying attention and she COULD get away with stealing a lot of loose cash that's around she only takes the $40 that she needs and no more and still feels some guilt. Now that's cool, right?  She's so cool she never had to borrow a penny from her wealthy folks. But her dad helped her buy a house. But it was in the "bad" part of Berkeley--really close to Oakland--so she's still cool, see? And there were, get this, DRUG DEALERS on her block! And they knew her name! And it was all just so effin COOL!  Every time she mentions that she spent big bucks on her yuppy life style she apologizes for it, to be sure you know she's not just some kind of a sell-out or something.  Oh yeah, and she's a name dropper. And her brother made a name for himself in advertising and is rich.  And her lifestyle is cooler than yours because she chose to live on temp jobs and be "poor" and arty.  Does everyone see that she's an ARTIST and will never just be normal or want to be? See? See? See? She even thought she might be a LESBIAN!!!! Now if that's not counter-culture what is? Wow.  Good grief. People I've known who are like Lisick are the worst kind of poseurs.   Oh yeah, and she's a MOM, but she's a COOL mom whose baby isn't yuppified because he's snotty (and she wipes his snot off with her hair at one point! Isn't that COOL?) and dirty and dressed all funky and weird. So you know she's an artist.  Please. Spare me this.. 
 I read this book, and found it to pretty much be a rehash of ideas and theories that have been around the internet and "hypochondriac" community for a while (I say hypochondriac community because that's how most doctors treat us and we're left to go find our own solutions).  There were NO surprises in this book.  No new information.  Its been around for years.  Some of these remedies might have worked for some people, but from what I can glean from internet discussion groups, most have not found relief from them, including myself, and rarely, if ever, have all the remedies worked on one person.  This book might be on the up and up, but in the end I was left feeling that this was more of an advertisement by a doctor looking for patients, rather than an autobiography.  I would be interested to hear if any of the other posters have found relief from what is in this book, or are they simply running on hope and some sort of validation that they are not really hypochondriacs, but victims of some medical community scam.  If not, you've got to wonder if its not just one more scam preying on those in need.  Been there, done that 
 Like the reader from Walnut Creek says, this book is essentially a weight training book, and frankly, not a very interesting, thorough, or original one.  I was sorely disappointed.  There was really no information that hasn't already been published a hundred times before in a hundred other similar books and magazines.  Nothing cutting edge or inspiring or anything that makes you stop and think, wow, now that's a good idea, I can't wait to try that.  I've enjoyed some of Staley's writings in the magazines and on his website, but this was just a real let down 
 Where is the Comparitve Statics section? Dynamic Analysis? Difference equations? Calculus of Variations? Optimal Control? Etc 
 This movie was just about the worst movie I ever saw... so utterly and painfully pointless, and not the slightest bit funny. Tom Green makes a complete fool of himeself. I actually turned off the movie half-way through because it was so stupid... Don't waste your time or money on this one! 
 I have read all of Patricia Cornwell books and love them all. Except this one.  I just liked it.  It was okay.  Not what I've come to expect from one of my favorite authors.  I was excited to see that there were new characters and I did enjoy them - as much as there was to know about them.  However the whole story did not develop very well, and it left me feeling like I missed a whole bunch of the 'potential' story.  I ended the book feeling like Ms. Cornwell was trying to make a statement to someone with this book rather than telling a story.  Very disappointed. 
 if amazon allowed zero stars, this would get it. absolutely awful. 
  If you want a garunteed way to become trendy then this series is perfect for you. This cd will become the coolest thing in your life until all of a sudden its considered passe. Then you'll have no choice but to buy NOW 25.If you ever look at NOW 1 you'll knotice how passe it has become. In ten years this cd will be just the same. Appreciate music for its own sake, forget about whats NOW 
 Disc Picture: The stylized VC-1-encoded 1.85:1 HD DVD picture features differing color schemes depending on the location. The entire presentation is void of highly resolved fine details.   Soundtrack: The Dolby® Digital Plus 5.1-channel soundtrack is not overly exciting, although bass is delivered well through each of the channels, although the noise floor is low, dialogue and effects are generally well recorded, and the sound matches the storytelling nicely.  
   robin thicke and justin timberlake are the pat boone's of our time  just  immensely more effete;   in this video/ information  age syle trumps substance.  liberal record execs have  finally mastered means of anticipating shaping and projecting  personal sexual cathartic  ideologies  into the mainstream , with precision.  it is said one man's music is another man's noise, well to call this garbage noise is to elevate it to the realm of debate.  this  isn't just bad , this is the triumph of the cynicism of the left on an increasingly numb non discerning populace.  
 I guess I'll be the only one here with a bad review of this Hitchcock movie.  Though we have a very original story here, I was amazed at feeling that the actors were saying their lines at the camera, not at the opposite actor. And flatly at that! Never have I seen it show as much (and I have seen a lot of movies!!!). Nobody seemed convinced of what they were doing. We all know that Dietrich is not the best actress in the world(more an extraordinary personality)but here, she is cold as ever. Wyman is better... and Sims is the treasure of the lot, with much life to his character.  However, at the risk of looking a bit out of order , I still encourage you to see it. I am not a Hitchcock fan, but I believe we learn to appreciate by viewing many different movies.. 
 This book has been summarized already by previous reviewers, so I won't rehash that. I agree with the reader from Austin that this book was very disappointing. To me, it seemed as if Shattuck couldn't decide whether the book should be literary criticism or historical overview or a chance for him to air out his morals. He tried to do all three at once, resulting in a bit of a mess. He kept switching back and forth between objective history lesson and subjective moralizing to the point where the points he professed to be trying to make became somewhat lost and pointless. The objective bits were dry and boring and the moralizing was condescending and annoying and insulting to the reader 
 LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIGHT FLASHLIGHTS.  THE PARTY THAT SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH CHARGE DURING SHIPPINS IS A LITTLE SHAKING IN THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF OF SHAKING BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A GLIMMER OF LIGHT. AFTER THAT IF YOU DON'T CONTINUE TO SHAKE IT DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY. THIS LIGHT MAY POSSIBLY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE BUT THERE ARE OTHER LED FLASHLIGHTS WITH BATTERIES THAT ARE SUPERIOR TO THIS ONE. THE POWER USED BY THESE LEDS IS LOW AND THE BATTERIES LAST A LONG TIME. 
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 I'm not sure what was so explosive here...? I'm not sure I learned anything I already didn't know. I'm not even sure I needed to add this book to my Beatles library. 
 The book actually looks like a photocopy of something else, and the information is not very specific. Just business info., not necessarily trucking info. Definitely not worth my time. 
 This is one of my favorite Tom Clancy novels.  However, I am going to return these cassette tapes because the 4th and last tape broke.  I will ask for a replacement though and not a refund 
 the dvd came in a timely manner, packaged well and I have had no problems with the item. It seems to be in great condition 
 To the reader unfamiliar with the complexity of Holocaust and Catholic history Fr Blet's book could appear helpful.  Indeed as a summary of the Vatican's 12 volume series of Vatican during WW2 it is indeed helpful.  I  argue that this is where the positives end. This work is so tightly bound  by its parameters that it is difficult to see how it contributes anything  to the debate over Pius XII's wartime role.  Blet has, by his own  admission, produced an edited version of the twelve volume series Actes et  Documents.  The lack of references, an index and contextual detail from  both the wider Catholic world and the war years make this work weak.  While  Cornwell may have stirred things up by asking difficult questions - at  least he took the risk and asked them.  By failing to even address Pius'  pre-1939 history (where the evidence for his future action or inaction lay)  Blet has avoided taking any risks with the subject matter.  It makes the  case for the Pope's defenders look precarious.  The treatment of the Rome  Jews in October 1943 belies the whole neutrality scenario of Pius XII. The  documentation cannot hope to cover all the aspects of this part of the  nightmare of the Shoah.  While the train rolled out of Rome he was silent.   At every stop up the Italian peninsula people rang the Vatican to inform  them where the train was in the hope that the Pope would say something.   The silence of October 1943 has no justification for whatever reason.  I  respect Cornwell because he at least tried to make sense of the man's  inaction.  I cannot respect Father Blet's work since it looks alarmingly  like a "damage control" exercise out to crush any suggestion that  Pius did make mistakes after all 
 What a waste of a great idea! The story doesn't really go anyhere, the science is vague yet still unbelievable, the romance is dull and the journal style used by the author falls apart on more than one occasion. For some reason it reminded me of the Planet of the Apes TV series. It is a  book for adults with a plot that young children could find fault with. My  advice is to read something else 
 Alright, for those of you who say Rand is criticizing works for false ideals, or lacking in substance, I say this: who is Rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are?  Who is Rand to say what substance is?  You've got to look at her bias, first.  Realize that Rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom.  As if outside factors never matter; and maybe they don't, for her.  Maybe her life in an oppressive Russia did nothing to form who she is today.  But I doubt it.  Though I believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live, outside influences do affect a person.  But she doesn't.  Thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap.  All books that are not driven solely by the individual's sense of reason: don't read, cause it will lessen your IQ.    Any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she doesn't find worthwhile or cannot understand, she condemns.  Rand, at least as portrayed in what I've read of her work, is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants.  And this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes.  They cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality, they are either good or worthless.   The pieces of art she says are empty ARE empty, absolutely.  They don't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer.  Nothing to offer her, that is.    How is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history's best books, telling OTHER people (with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual) What they should read?  Truthfully any criticism in this form, like a list I saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world, is elitist crap trying to close people's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others.  They have their bias like anyone else.  I say read in variety.  Observe art outside of Rand's choice of art.  Take in all you can, with an open mind, then start pondering whether you agree or not.  If you then agree because YOU agree, then I say great.  Its the basic individualistic response that Rand seems to forget to address.  She says question society, but by my line of inquiry.  She says be an individual, but only I know the basis of who you want to be 
 The information is there but I can't keep my eyes open long enough to find it. There are some great training books out there. This is not one of them 
 Conseco claims to have written this book to reveal steroids dominating presence in baseball; however it seems he just wanted to upset as many people as possible with its publication.  Juiced is Conseco's elementary cry for justice.  He unapologetically admits to steroid use and acts as if he is a martyr for the betterment of baseball.  He points fingers, name drops, and defends every blemish of his career in this "memoir."  Constantly referring to the "double-standard" in baseball, he fails to suggest any remedy or efforts to solve the problem.  His book openly criticizes whites, women, owners, managers, government agencies, trainers, reporters, and is bound to make you mad too 
 I was looking for the dambusters movie. This is not it.  I have not watched much of it yet.  It is critical of the raid and the bit I saw refers to the "terrorism" against Germany.  Not in the spirit of the movie or the truth as I understand it 
 Mr. Yancey has no respect for the teaching of the Bible.  God is always there when it hurts.  In fact, God allows hurt.  Look at Book of Job.  God allowed Satan to kill Job's children (!!!) and tempt his wife away from Job and give Job a horrible disease.  God was always there.  In fact, God was a part of the plan to CAUSE Job to suffer.  Why?  On a whim.  Satan said that Job would lose faith if disaster struck him, so God said, "Okay, give it your best shot!"  Sometimes, God sends disasters into your home for a whim, for a wager with Satan.  This is the lesson from the Book of Job.  Sometimes, God Himself brings pain and death because Christians refuse to uphold the interests of the Kingdom of Christ.  Look at the book of Jeremiah.  It was God who chose to kill Israelites, destroy the Jerusalem Temple.  In fact, Jeremiah specifically states that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was not a believer, was anointed by God to bring destruction.  It's like God anointing Bin Laden to destroy America.  That would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation.  The Bible is clear that God chose King Nebuchadnezzar to destroy the Jerusalem Temple and kill Israelites.  And anyone who opposed King Nebuchadnezzar opposed God Himself.  How does this apply to Bin Laden.  This is how seriously God takes desecration of His House, the Christian Church.  God will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy America if America desecrates God's houses.  And opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing God Himself.  Mr. Yancey should think seriously about what God teaches about suffering.  God gives suffering when believers desecrate His house.  God sends death and destruction when Christians refuse to uphold the interst of Christ.  This is an important lesson for America to learn 
 We were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday.  After opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied.  However the screen is very disappointing.  I can't even rate the games because overall I simply just can't see what is on it.  The product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing.  I should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products.  I would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it 
 This product is routine Yoga and is not something unique. It is exactly which you can find in other Yoga classes 
 Very rarely does a film improve upon the source novel. I wrote a review of one, King's Ransom, which was made into a vastly superior film by Akira Kurosawa called High and Low. Goldfinger, the film, is one of the classic Bonds -- my favorite, to be sure. The novel, in contrast, is too long, is illogical in some parts, offensive in others and makes the reader realize what a superb job screenwriter Richard Maibaum did in adapting it for the film. These weaknesses stand out in particular:  First, the behavior of villain Auric Goldfinger is completely illogical during the torture scene. You might remember the terrific laser beam scene in the film where Goldfinger, played by Gert Frobe, threatens to slice James Bond, played by the great Sean Connery, in half. In the film, Bond gets out of the mess by bluffing, making Goldfinger believe that he knows all about Operation Grand Slam, Goldfinger's plan to blow up Fort Knox. Goldfinger reasons that he can keep the CIA and the British Secret Service at bay by keeping Bond alive and making them think that Bond is his guest, not his prisoner.  The novel, in contrast, has Goldfinger threaten Bond with a saw. Bond doesn't mention Operation Grand Slam and has been a constant thorn in Goldfinger's side. Goldfinger has Bond dead to rights and, unlike in the laser beam scene in the film, has no logical reason to spare his life. However, just before Bond is about to be sawed in half, Goldfinger inexplicably spares him and forces Bond to pose as his secretary. There's a running joke that Bond villains seal their own fate by devising elaborate ways to kill him that allow Bond to escape. However, Goldfinger's action in this scene in the novel completely defy logic and cripple the story's credibility. Bond novels are an escape from reality -- an adult comic book -- but this plot development makes absolutely no sense.  In the novel, Goldfinger's plan is to rob Fort Knox of its gold supply. Fleming, unlike Richard Maibaum, apparently never realized how logistically impossible this is. Connery rightfully points out in the film that to rob Fort Knox would require a whole fleet of trucks and several days to complete. Maibaum's plan, while still fantastic, makes more sense -- detonating a nuclear weapon in Fort Knox to irradiate the U.S. gold supply and drive the value of his own supply up ten times over.  In the novel, Pussy Galore begins as a hardened lesbian who has no interest in Bond whatsoever. Of course, by the end of the novel, Bond has "heterosexualized" and overwhelmed her with his masculine charms. It's a very 1950's view of homosexualtiy -- that is, that a homosexual could be "cured" of his/her sexual desires like it was a disease. The attitude seems very backward and ignorant by today's standards.  The film strongly suggests Pussy's lesbianism, but it also shows Pussy, played by Honor Blackman, flirting suggestively with Bond. Blackman's Pussy may have lesbian tendencies, but she clearly also has a strong attraction to the opposite sex. When she falls for Bond, it makes sense, unlike in the novel. Bond still converts her, but the conversion stressed is more along the lines of Pussy joining the good guys rather than going from staunch lesbianism to being a Bond girl.  The film has a lot of Asian villains. Harold Sakata is terrific as Goldfinger's superpowered Korean henchman Oddjob, Burt Kwouk (Kato in the Pink Panther films) is Mr. Ling, a Chinese nuclear scientist who supplies Goldfinger with the bomb and most of Goldfinger's henchmen are Korean. However, the film, for the most part, avoids extreme racial stereotyping. Many of the villains are Asian, but there's no suggestion that simply being Asian is a source of evil. Asians would later play a prominent heroic role in You Only Live Twice.  The novel, in contrast, is vicously racist in nature. The nadir of this being Bond's statement that Koreans "are lower than apes." It's hard to believe that even in the pre-civil rights era of the 1950's, this statement could slip by without triggering a major protest from an Asian rights group. Today, it seems so ugly and hateful that I immediately lost a lot of respect for Ian Fleming. This is his hero who believes these vile things, so clearly what Bond believes, Fleming believes -- there's no way to separate the two. One wonders which other racial groups Fleming was bigoted against. It's a disgraceful moment in the Bond saga and a shameful comment on Fleming's view of the world.  Novels like Casino Royale, From Russia With Love, Dr. No, On Her Majesty's Secret Service and You Only Live Twice are classics and rank among my favorite novels. Goldfinger, however, falls way short of that standard. When I finished Goldfinger, I was left wishing that I had not read it and instead had left my impression of the story to the vastly superior film. The novel not only disappointed me, it made me think much less of Ian Fleming as a person 
 basically, this cd/dvd is documentation of green day's sloppiest, all time low, and over all worst tour ever. with the addition of so many band members onstage, why, i wonder, do billie mike and tre play sloppier? on this tour, mike misses many backing vocals, billie's guitar playing is at an all time sloppiness (embarassing for such an amazing guitarist). also, billie's guitar sounds are TERRIBLE, why can't he make his les paul juniors as powerful as they sound on the recordings? anyways, about this cd/dvd: it's nothing more than a handpicked selection of the most overplayed songs from the tour (their "greatest hits") with the banter completely cut out. it is very very dissapointing coming from a band who used to put on an amazing energetic live show. but.... if you are a new fan to the band or are young and stupid, then you will probably love this cd/dvd 
 I purchased this seat because of the safety factor that Consumer Reports reported on.  In comparing the seat to Graco Snugride, however, I am very disappointed on the tough, very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat.  The foam goes down to a certain point on baby's low back, and then disappears, leaving a dip for baby's buttocks.  Just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region (with buttocks not supported) ...not comfortable.  I wonder how a baby's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat...well, I'm not going to take any chances.   Baby Trend should have consulted a Physical Therapist (like me) before designing this seat.   
 I read to be entertained.  As most American males I've always had some interest in Playboy Playmates so I thought this might be an interesting read.  What was interesting was hearing of Hef's Wednesday/Friday orgies that end up with multiple girls and him.  Nice life Hef. Unfortunately, the author, who begged to live the Playboy lifestyle and pursued a photo shoot layout and invitation to the mansion, suddenly gets morals and is shocked and appalled by what she discovers.  What was she thinking?  Her only point is she thought Hef was so old (and physically gross) she couldn't believe the girls actually had to sexually perform with him.  DID SHE ACTUALLY KNOW ANYTHING OF HIS LIFESTYLE?   So if you want to know what goes on with Hef and his girlfriends, it's here.  Unfortunately, everything else in this book is pathetic.  She's 30 but continues to tell us how beautiful she is as she aggressively pursues her dream with boyfriend in tow.  What a klutz he must be to fall for this!  Then when she somewhat achieves her dream, she's shocked by the degradation and jealousy among the girls.  Come on!  When you're living with a guy with lots of money and multiple girlfriends there is destined to be jealousy amongst the girls.    Overall, this is a very bad book written by someone who wants her 15 minutes in the spotlight.  There is not enough material for a book and the writer clearly is in love with herself which comes off pathetic in the book.  If you want to see what Hef's up to maybe you'll like the book.  Other than that the only positive comment I can relay is that it is a short book.   
 I went through 3 of these in less than 2 months.  After about 2-3 weeks of use, the first two dryers wouldn't shut off when the switch was placed in the "off" position; the dryers had to be unplugged to turn them off.  The 3rd dryer just stopped working completely after about 2 weeks.  I definitely do not recommend buying this product 
 Well, I just received Gavin Lambert's book on Natalie Wood, and after trudging through this monotonous, overblown biography, the conclusion is as follows: it's boring as hell!  (I can't say I haven't been warned). This is the "wonderful" biography of Natalie that is supposed to set the record straight?  It boasts 78 photos, but instead of being included in a glossy pictures section, they are widespread on various pages in the book so that they appear grainy.  It seems to me that it was written as a rebuttal, and to paint Lana Wood as a greedy, vicious person (she was obviously not interviewed), and to make childish slaps at her, when she was not given the opportunity to tell her side of it.   Robert Wagner seems threatened by anyone who knew Natalie before he, Lambert and Mart Crowley did - dismissing all of the people Natalie befriended before who offered their insights in "Natasha: The Biography Of Natalie Wood" as vultures who barely made her aquaintance and who are weaving fantasies about her.  Basically, Wagner is uncomfortable with the aspects of Natalie's life that he was not involved in.  It doesn't really attempt to get behind Natalie's persona any, like "Natasha" did, and of course, it doesn't acknowledge Natalie's love for Jimmy Williams, her first boyfriend, the rape by a famous actor, or what happened on the night of her death, hastily tying up loose ends and making her death sound so simple.  Lambert wrote this book for Wagner, there's no question, and Natasha and Courtney are hardly mentioned at all.  Did Lambert actually do any in-depth research?  As well, there are allegations that Nick Gurdin may not have been Natalie's or Lana's father, and then there's Natasha Lofft, who has not proven with DNA that she is actually Natalie's half sister, but Wagner and the girls have no problem believing that she is, but they dismiss Suzanne Finstad's book as speculation and trash? I'll believe this claimant's story when I see proof! At least Finstad was able to remain somewhat objective and unbiased, since she did not know Natalie (and she did try to get Wagner's input, but he refused) which is obviously not the case with this pathetic attempt at a so-called "definitive" biography. Much of the book appears to be written quickly, but at least it does name the film Natalie turned down, which was reputed to have the actor who raped her in the cast.  And of course, it has to dispel all the allegations of Wagner's sexual orientation, and what played the role in the demise of his first marriage to Natalie.  As much of a disappointment as this book is, I'm glad I purchased it so I can compare it to "Natasha" and Lana's book to try to decipher what is closer to the truth.  At least I didn't have to spend too much money on it!  Whatever the truth, I hope that Natalie is at peace. 
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 Simply put: the movie is boring.  Clichï¿½ upon clichï¿½ is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.  All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.   Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. 
 Although it had some good parts (hence the 2 stars), it was very bad overall.  Most of the book was garbage that consisted of applying theories of finance and psychology to why he lost money on WorldCom and to use those theories to justify his losses, almost saying "it wasn't my fault, look at rule 6, thats why I lost money".  If you want to learn about the stockmarket, I wouldn't reccommend you do it from someone who bought worldcom (and WCOM options outright)all the way down, only a few years ago!  
 Superficial, scattered with an odd smattering of references, this is one of the worst biographies that I have ever read. Ted Hughes deserves better 
 I agree with the previous reviewer.  When they re-released this book, they should have updated it. It makes the author looks silly.  But more importantly, it raises questions about this entire Fundamentalist worldview. This movement is constantly pronouncing so-called timeless values, visions, a prophecies, etc., then they change their minds every few years.  In 1981, the apocalypse was upon us. Then Clinton was the anti-christ, then Saddam...what's next?   In 1981, these same people condemned women preaching & working because the Bible was so clearly against it. Now, these same people are hiring female preachers and writing books to help women balance working while having children. Did the Bible really change that much in 25 years?  In 1961, these same people were against people of color in their churches, for multiple so-called "Biblical" reasons. And as you all know, we must always interpret the Bible literally. In fact, it took a Supreme Court intervention in 1986 to get the fundamentalists & southern baptists to open their schools up to blacks.   Now, because they see the money rolling in, they are building coalitions with African-American preachers like TD Jakes and Eddie Long.  And, of course, the fundamentalist church will never, ever, ever, ever...not in a million years...ordain gays and lesbians. That is, until they change their minds at their next board meeting.  So what changes? The Bible? Morality? Does God change his mind this much? Or is it the opportunistic charlatans of the fundamentalist movement?  Trying to follow the "gospel truth", Biblical inerrancy, and the timeless & unchanging laws of the Bible (that is, however they are interpreted this week) is making my head spin 
 Bogus. These are not the original tracks and they lack a lot of the original feeling of those great records. The covers are mere filler. Let me save you the time it cost me to execute a return to Amazon.... 
 The Chinese victory over the USA will make you ask this question.  What's wrong with America?  Thousands of things.  USA dishonors Christ through its sexual immorality.  Look at the rampant pre-marital sex in America.  Don't tell me that America is a Holy Nation or a Christian Nation.  It's not.  China is more pure.  We illegalize homosexuality and forbid pre-marital sex.  China is a more pure nation.  Christian writers don't seem to care about the purity of America.  Mr. Philip Yancey hasn't written one book on it.  I rest my case 
 I have to agree with another review I just read here. The quality seems to be good, but it's just too small for any big screen. Ours is a 42" Philips Ambilight 42PF9631/37. The description here says the wall-mount is for 22-49", but the manufacturer does not agree with that. On the box and in the manual it says 23-46". Don't believe that either. It's only just over 16" wide, so there's just no way. It's also not going to work well if your studs are more than 16" (for example 24") apart. I'm also disappointed by the service of Peerless, because I emailed them the story above 2 weeks ago and I never got any reaction. This one is going back to Amazon. We bought a Sanus now, which seems to be perfect and not that much more expensive here at Amazon, while it costs about double elsewhere. Tip: Check your manual thoroughly and see if it mentions anything about VESA 
 Interestig title and premise. Good for someone who is looking towards sales as a career option. Could possibly serve as a tool for a sales manager to help team members employees with minimal  experience to discover themselves. Don't invest in this book if you are an experienced sales executive 
 In the final chapter of his book, Becker writes that "(r)eading this book will not solve all your writing problems.  It will hardly solve any of them."         I agree 
 Kahney is a hack, sadly, and while Mac fanatics may love a world in which Apple can do no wrong, they will be ill-served by this bomb 
 I must agree with previous reviewer comments.  This book attempts to describe the Directorate of Science and Technology, yet it focuses on the bureaucracy of upper management and has little discussion regarding the programs and technologies created by the DS&T.  This organization has played a cricial role in shaping modern history, yet the book is dull and uninteresting to read 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 This is a truly amazing book! This is a book written by a highly uneducated person for even less educated reader. As the author says in the introduction, this book is designed for young people of all ages... Well, what's that, "young of all ages?"  Simple: those "whose imagination has not been stifled by standard educational process."  At the very outset, the author reassures the reader that the book is not going to be a technical or scientific one. He says with a poorly concealed pride "My brush with academia was a fairly short one:  I was expelled from kindergarten at the age of four... and have never managed to resume normal studies since, not to mention graduating from anyplace."  As a result, "I am a fairly stupid fellow who could not learn any mathematics at all."  This lack of really serious knowledge of anything does not prevent the author from making judgments, always with a sort of  "elegance of ignorance", regarding very big topics, like, say, theory of relativity, and holography, and brain functioning (through electromagnetic and sound vibrations), and Biggg Banggg, of course. So, my recommendation to those with at least K12 education: do not waste time and find a better way to spend $9.97.    The most surprising aspect of  this book is that Dr. William Tiller, a  respected scientist and writer, found it possible to write a preface for this book.  This preface is the best part of the book. 
 I don't know what everyone else is listening to, but I listed to this album and it put me to sleep. For real. There's nothing new here and everything sounds the same. In other words: "Ghetto Classics" is boring. There's not even one song on here that could be a "ghetto classic." 
 I found this songbook to be most unimpressive as far as faithful recreations of the songs and only worthwhile to get if there's no alternative. Not only are the arrangements not true to the original harmonies, but whole verses and introductions are left out, and the keys are drastically changed (sosmetimes as much as a fourth lower), which gives the wrong impressions as to the how the song should sound, and the type of voice suited to the song. According to the keys in this songbook, the role of Sarah Brown was sung by an alto when in reality it's a soprano role. Also, I question the leaving out of "Marry the Man Today", one of the best songs in the show. The photos of the different productions at the beginning of the book are nice, but they don't make up for its musical shortcomings 
 This book should have been called "What can you buy if you are thinking about playing with scanner", and it is good at that. It does not tell you much about scanning, it is more about buying equipment, and possibly software related to scanning. Just think about it: There is a chapter "Where to buy", and a chapter "Buying on ebay". There is no chapter "Do this if you miss shadow detail", though. This book is aimed at a high school student who is doing his/her first steps with a film camera and wants to get those pictures into the computer (is there such a person these days?) The book even mentions cross processing. No, it does not say what should you do if you need to scan a cross-processed film. It just says that you can process your film in the wrong developer and it will affect the image on the film.  I was greatly impressed by the chapter on sending off your slides for scanning. Well you definetly need a book to tell you that you can do that, and it greatly improves your scanning skills If I had a chance to look at the book at the local store I would not ever buy it. Now it goes back to Amazon 
 This episode is the darkest and possibly the weakest of the three. If this movie is being shown to children, parents should preview it first and fast forward through some of the parts. 
 A rambling, boring plot; major characters that aren't remotely plausible; potentially interesting characters that make a brief appearance only to be killed off; major plot elements that aren't really resolved - all this and more in what must be one of the most poorly written books I've read in the last decade.  Don't waste your time on this stinker 
 way to much information. it was good and all but it had too much info and was a slow read. i didn't liek it too much. too much info 
 I truly feel sorry for Pynchon, knowing that writing this atrocity of a novel probably cost him many months of life.  By all means, if you want to read it, get it from the library as I strongly advise against laying out cold cash for this mockery.  Does anyone really care that a man's sexual episodes predict German V rockets falling on England?  Is it really important to World Literature that a man dreams he is being sucked down a toilet surrounded by crap and toilet paper and can even smell which race the crap came from?  The so-called Intellectuals who praise this claptrap are the same Great Thinkers that believe Ulysses by James Joyce is the best novel of all time.  I would rather read the worse writing of de Balzac than waste one more second perusing either of these novels.  Both these "novels" are truly "sound and fury .... signifying nothing."  
 I suppose I was expecting the same excellent quality of Judy Lowes other book on Tennessee Gardening. The pages are grainy, and the pictures are few. Everything you can find here, is in her book "Tennessee Gardeners Guide". Buy that book and save yourself money 
 My son (age 8) was really disappointed in the Avatar books (we purchased all 3) because they look like chapter books but really they are just cartoon books and very basic cartoon books at that.  We love everything Avatar but these books were a waste. 
 If you are fourteen and read your first bestseller, you might finish it... But if you have read more than 10 books in your life..this is soooo boring 
 This is a surprisingly poorly written textbook.  One can tell that more and more information has simply been cut and pasted into this book over the years. The continuity and organization of the book suffers.  The authors (or a new author) should consider writing a new text from scratch --- one that encompasses the entire field of substance abuse counseling more comprehensively 
 Heres a new one....I have recently bought two spindles of these discs, and my computer (Imac w/ Intel chip-hardly outdated) simply doesnt recognize them-like I never put in a disc at all.  The kicker is that this spring, I also ordered two spindles of these discs (exactly the same as far as I can tell), from which I burned one hundred discs (not a single faulty one!) for a freind overseas.  I have no idea what the deal is, but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs.  Anyone got ideas? 
 First part was "sorta" interesting.  Rest of book skimmed through - VERY BORING.  Could have been a great read but certainly missed the mark by a mile.  Should have been a magazine article at best 
 Unlike the other reviewers, I found this book to be less than helpful.  Yes, it does talk some about different literary-related fields, and I stress some, but the book lacks serious discussion of those careers.  Plus, it gives limited resources for finding out more information....no websites and no mention of other literary career-related books.  It only lists a few professional associations for each career.  Also, there were no surprises as to which careers were selected, such as...becoming a librarian.  If you just want a taste of what literary careers are out there, this book is worth a skim at your local bookstore, but if you really want to find out about these careers, follow up with books specifically geared toward a particular career

 Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!! Put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it, laugh in a malicious tone because you haven't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written!! This book ends with such a melancholy abruption that I thought I might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes. This book...is horrendous. -ANGRY READER 
 The camcorder does not have remote control but there is a battery  in the box with remote control written on it. You can not copy the recorded movies on the camputer. other than that it is easy to use abd sufficient 
 I bought this book along with two others prior to "landing" my pharmaceutical sales job and it was a big disappointment. Why? It doesn't contain anything that several of the other top selling pharmaceutical sales books do and then this little book only contains about 1/3 of the information that the others contain. The best and most comprehensive book by far on the subject is the "Insider's Guide to the World of Pharmaceutical Sales." That one helped me get my current job.  Another book that contained some useful information was "PharmRepSelect." Don't waste your money on this one.  
 Idiocracy  It's fair to compare Mike Judge's Office Space to his latest film, Idiocracy, because both movies approach their subjects from a position of satire.  I argue that Office Space is far more successful due to a smarter script, a great cast, excellent soundtrack, and sympathetic characters.  While Office Space tells an intelligent and funny tale, Idiocracy is a morality comedy with one running joke - the world is getting dumber.  It's a boring, tired joke that doesn't get any funnier the more Judge tells it.  In the end, Idiocracy is professional wrestling for people with master's degrees.  Before listing grievances, I should write that I generally agree with Judge's assessment of the United States and the world at large.  Instead of being used wisely to advance humanity, media has been engaged as a weapon to wage war against ideas and experimentation, and used to promote emotional conservation of the status quo.  Unthinking idiots who gather around the idiot box every evening are complicit in this downward spiral.  I will also admit that I liked Judge's assertion that the average person today can make a difference, but that one must take a risk and lead.  The world, left to the idiots, will inevitably become worse.  Finally, the movie has helped me to decide to cancel my cable television subscription tomorrow.  The only new shows I watch anymore are The Daily Show and The Colbert Report.  I don't watch all of the good and rare movies that air every night on TMC.  I watch re-runs of cartoon shows that I have seen a million times.  I don't read books often enough.  Instead, I spend too many nights watching terrible documentaries on the prison system.  I cannot continue this mindless existence.  I also cannot credit Idiocracy with all of my motivation to leave mainstream media - I've known that something had to change for a while now - but the movie made what I already knew more urgent, demanding immediate changes.  You might wonder why I gave the film a low score if I found that it positively affected my life.  First and foremost, the movie is dumb and doesn't trust the viewer to "get it" without overwhelmingly heavy-handed sight gags and so-called dialogue.  This is utterly ironic, because the film is trying to teach the viewer to look more critically at the world, to question why intelligence, challenges, and knowledge are being shunted in favor of the cheapest, most melodramatic, and instant of gratifications.  The most complete irony, however, is that the film does to its audience what it claims contemporary culture does to us now: It appeals to our emotions instead of our minds.  There's nothing intellectually engaging or thought-provoking about this film.  The movie consists entirely of fears you have already considered, and so the film's only function is to reinforce biases.  Perhaps Judge is playing a joke on those who think this film is profound.  It wouldn't be the first time.  Beavis and Butthead ridiculed its audience WHILE they were watching it.  It was brilliant.  I have a feeling, though, that Judge simply misfired with Idiocracy 
 Mack 10 is good for a laugh.these lyrics&music are played out like 5 years back.i hear Cube pulling the strings here and that's one of the reasons why he has fallen off so bad.trying to give a 3rd tier rapper 2nd  rate Rhymes.and the guests alone don't make no sense 
 Blowback follows very well trodden ground. A standard cop vs. serial killer movie, it sticks to the cliches of the genre.  The killer's "twist" is that he kills each victim in the style of a martyred saint, with a bible reference in a test tube placed in the mouth. Perhaps the intention is to echo other recent screen psychos like Seven's John Doe or Silence of the Lambs' Buffalo Bill. Blowback's villain is, however, like all the other characters, lacking in character depth and ultimately unconvincing.   Mark L. Lester, the director, has been a prolific producer of mediocre action movies, notably Commando and Big Trouble in Little China. Some of these can perhaps survive as late night movies to be watched over a few beers. Still, even among the lesser cop movies, there are a lot that should be seen before this one. Try Fallen or Bone Collector. Regarding the DVD, it's 3:4 format, with no features (not that you'd want them 
 This is the worst sequel I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the first one ,but did it have to be this cheesy and boring. They aged mia, got rid of michael, threw her together with some loser, and made up some bogus law about marriage. I was really disappointed 
 This comic is one to be careful of! It is displayed and sold linked to harmless pin-up type cartoon comics but it is actually a very graphic cartoon pornographic publication. Not one for the squeamish or easily offended! 
 Has this been any other author, I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  But as is sometimes the case with her earlier works, I kept reading on in hopes that the book would get better - it didn't.  After I got through enough of the book (having only about 100 page left to read), I just had to skip to the end to get the experience over with.  As another reviewer worded, this was quite one-dimensional and the characters were a bit disturbing, but not in the good sense, and the story just dragged on for far too long.  I grew annoyed having put so much time into reading this and it was quite the let down.  Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.    I don't recommend this book at all 
 Massage as presented here looks dutiful and joyless. Why bother 
 Television is the only thing I have to look forward to, my life is sad and depressing and oh god I am going to cry  *** :( Get rid of television? are you insane?, how else would you get the children to shutu 
 Sorry, if one is casting for a MUSICAL movie, one should actually cast actors who can SING, not just actors who have big names. Sophia Loren couldn't carry a tune to save her life.  I love musicals, but this is one I do not like at all 
 While it has it's bright moments, there are far better books out their.  I guess I expected more from this author. Hollywood is fun but there are more imporant figures to promote involved in science, engineering and chemistry. Does Jesus all want us to be ornaments?  Give me a break 
 To follow up on the printing. The copy I got was very, very bad. Pretty much every page has multiple printing errors making the book very difficult to read and in some places you need to understand the content already to make headway.  The book used to ship with a CD. Now there's a sheet saying to go look at phptr.com for a download. I could not find the CD download, but I did find the book in pdf. At least the pdf can be read.  Bad job Prentice Hall!  
 This book is unfortunately not up to par for Kay Hooper.  Her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is (there isn't a single clue at any point in time).  The heroine keeps loosing her memory, so you don't even have the usual good characterizations of hero & heroine (since she can't even remember much about herself, much less him).  If you like Kay go ahead and read it, but I hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard 
 This is a quick read.  The reason I picked it up was trying to understand why a bully at work had me down.  On pg 224 the matter is addressed, "Frequently there is someone in the workplace who is snappish, constantly angry or agitated, or who has an emotional hair trigger.  The addiction to unhappiness can cause you to take other people's grouchiness personally, when in fact it's not about you but about them.  If these difficult coworkers or managers treat everyone else the same way, there is certainly no reason to feel particularly singled out or attacked.  By taking their behavior personally, you gratify your addiction to unhappiness and ruin an otherwise good day."    Okay... I feel like I've been given a pat on the head and told to run along.    Every problem outlined is blamed on one's parents and sends you back to their previous book, Smart Love, to understand how the failures of your parents are to blame for everything from eating addictions to my problem with a bully.    Having said that, I think they have identified a real issue - it is mysterious but some people do shoot themselves in the foot when life looks good - but this book is a disappointment if you think it will help you overcome this tendency.  The Piepers tout the magic of their therapy sessions which may indeed be true, however this book recycles typical self-help ideas:  make a plan for change and be vigilant that you don't backslide, but mostly they repeat over and over again the idea that you are either preventing yourself from achieving happiness or you are actively choosing to cause your own unhappiness 
 If this were a satirical view of Regency books, I might have bought the far-fetched storyline, the flat, idiotic characters, and the absolute silliness of the rather dull plot.  As I rather suspect it is not a satire - Catherine Coulter being a best-selling Romance novelist - it was disappointing to say the very least.  I only, I repeat, only listened to it in its entirety because I hadn't brought anything else to listen to at work one day.  If you like historical romance that's fun and funny, try Katie MacAlister's book "Improper English", or for some more serious historical fiction, check out Phillippa Gregory's Wideacre series 
 I bought this spinner because I love my KitchenAid mixer, a workhorse that has never disappointed.  This spinner however, has problems.  It has a confusing design, a handle that sticks up unappealingly, you have to "lock" the lid down before you use it and the pump handle is difficult to push down.  It does dry the lettuce eventually.  If you use your spinner a lot this one is not for you. I wish I hadn't bought it 
 This adventure of Cheech & Chong see's them playing a couple of dudes who work for some Arab dudes who like want them to drive a car from Detroit to Las Vegas but they have no idea why, they just wanna get paid for the job. Theres a lot of things happening to them as the drive from one place to the other.   There isnt much of the Stoner Humor in this one compared to other C&C movies. The laughs arnt there as strong as the other either, but the humour is still defintly there. I have a feeling Richard "Cheech" Marin probably wanted to show he could act as something other then the Cheech charactor, they play a couple of Arabs in the movie aswell, and lean more towards a humor not so pot headed. I think Cheech was trying to establish himself as a real actor. But least he stayed true to Cheech tho, he didnt kill the charactor or anything.  I'd say this is the weakest of all the C&C movies. I even think Get Out Of My Room is funnier then this... but dont count it out tho, it's still got some great bits in it.... my fav is when Cheech needs to go to the bathroom and ends up going a way he didnt expect.  There's no bonus features or anything which is a bummer. Seems the only one to get any attention has been the first movie... if there not going to give these things extra features, then they should have at least made the DVD a double feature with Nice Dreams (Columbian release's, thats why that particuler title)  We need a new Cheech & Chong movie, this may be the weakest, but it's still better then most of the stoner movies being made these days, thats why we need Tommy and Richard to make a new one to show the kids today how it's done 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 This is the first book of his I've read. I just got it because I'd heard so much about him. So it's amazing, the way he can make you feel that you are there, on an exotic vacation. But all it is, is drinking and sex! First they have a drink, then they have sex, then they drink somemore, get a haircut, have sex, drink, go swimming, drink, have sex. PLEASE. Well it is David and Catherine's honeymoon. But still! I don't think it was worth me reading... though I think he is a great author, the subject of the book was implausible and silly. You go on your honeymoon and end up falling in love and having sex with another woman? and your wife does too? crazy 
 I listened to this on CD in my car...driving around western Virginia.   -The author is not a very good reader...her rhythm/intonation is off...but I didn't mind the flubs at all. It's nice to have a reader that sounds like a real person. And by having her read it, the we avoid the distraction of having the technical terms being pronounced incorrectly. (Although I'm not used to hearing "hooves" rhyming with "moves".)  -It's a matter of taste, but talking animals (or babies, for that matter) have no appeal whatsoever for me. Ugh! And if they did talk, no horse that I've ever ridden would have said, "Are you all right?" when I fell off. I believe they'd say, "Aaaaaaaaah...at last. Hey, there's some grass!"  -Being a woman of a certain age, I liked the Sister character, (although I don't believe she still had her figure at 72). But the denouement---and Sister's actions in it---was utterly improbable and illogical. Gimme a break 
 Was not helpful in starting, had to have someone show me. Wouldn't recommend the book 
 If you want to waste your money on a useless product, then buy shedender. The people that give it a decent review on this site do so because it removes a lot of hair (specifically undercoat). However, my guess is that you are considering this product because you want less shedding. The rub is that the undercoat doesn't shed (not that much anyway) the top coat does. So all your doing with shedender is removing the undercoat that isn't the root of your shedding problem in the first place, and is needed for protection from the cold should you have a pet that goes outside.  As I said, this product does remove a lot of hair. However, after a full session with the shedender, I went back to my regular wire brush and brushed out just as much hair as I usually do. The next day, I wired out just as much as I would have if I didn't use shedender. The bottom line, your pets shed from their top coat, not the bottom coat; so you're wasting your time and money with this product 
 Reading this novel was slow going.  As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them.  The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered.  There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing.  Not one of Jane Austen's best 
 Does the Methodist Church canonize saints?  If so, they'll have to make way for St. Laura, arguably the most perfect person who ever ever lived.  That was my numb response after reading and annotating this turgid, 240-page confection by Ron Kessler.  "Our parents would say, 'We want you to be like Laura Welch [Bush]," said [classmate] Pamela Nelson... They would say, 'We want you to be friends with Laura Welch.  We want you to run around with Laura Welch.'  It was because she was like a perfect girl to her mother and dad... everyone thought she was perfect."  That's just part of the unending stream of laudatory Stepford quotes delivered in this "intimate portrait."  Fully authorized by the Bushes, Kessler quotes the choicest morsels from folks who subsequently get appointed, say, ambassador to Switzerland, and begins paragraphs like this: "Steeped in Midland values, [George W.] Bush sees himself as a humble servant of God."    This book is "ladylike" in the very worst sense of the word.  Laura Bush is vaguely present while a host of authorized sources, as well as Kessler, b*tch-slap Hillary Clinton ("I can't believe her book is selling so well," murmurs Laura), the White House staffers who unpardonably wore out the carpets during the eight years of the previous Administration, Teresa Heinz Kerry, Senator Edward Kennedy, the so-called "liberal" media who are "picking on" (Laura's words) that law-breaking Bush twins, and many, many more.  Most controversies of the lives of George W. and Laura Bush, as well as most of W.'s stint in the White House, are skipped right over, apart from praising Laura's "quiet dignity."  That's why the book's so short.  This dainty text contains no Diebold, no Enron, no Halliburton, no Plame, neither a DeLay nor an Abramoff, and a solitary reference to Laura's furtive chain-smoking.  Through Kessler's skillful omissions and summarizing, W's businesses don't go splat on the page, nobody was evicted to make room for the Texas Rangers' stadium, and there's nary a mention of the Texas Air National Guard.  Bush 43 glides noiselessly from Yale to Harvard Business School, as seven years disappear, just like magic.  Little new material is provided in this book that isn't available in the hagiographies that the author thoughtfully provides in his bibliography.  However, if you care, Laura's contact lenses are not tinted, and she's had no truck with Botox.  She hates to cook and loves to scrub things down with Windex and 409.  Her husband's grubby bachelor habits are detailed down to the last bundle of fetid old clothes.  (I did, however, enjoy learning that the stress of the aborted vote recount in 2000 caused W. to develop a festering boil, which he showed off to his dinner guests.)  Kessler sinks his fangs deeply into Ann Gerhart's astute book, "The Perfect Wife," which is about as close to a fair-and-balanced biography of Laura Bush as we're likely to find in the mainstream media.  When writing about Laura Bush, Kessler's style is so twee that I wondered how he managed to type this book with both pinkies raised.  He seems to be very easily impressed.  "On top of her duties as First Lady," he gushes, "Laura has somehow found time to read at least a book a week."  Really?  A whole book?  Just like thousands of Amazon customers do?  He goes on to quote a writer from Business Week who cooes, "The first lady is undoubtedly the most literate person in... Bush's inner circle.  Jackie Kennedy seems like a dilettante in comparison."  Poor, cultured Jackie.  And poor us, if Laura really is the most literary person in Bush's inner circle, and has as little input into policy as Kessler says she does.  Kessler reassures the dwindling GOP faithful that though Laura remains pro-choice, otherwise "she never really had any political opinions."   Laura also dotes on "literature on the bubonic plague and other epidemics.  'I love plague books,' Laura said."  Uh-oh.  What ostensibly was the biggest shock of Laura's youth--when she ran a stop sign and killed a high-school classmate ("with... big ears," Kessler adds eugenically)--is padded fore and aft with explanations of how dangerously Detroit used to build cars.  Please.  I'm a decade younger than the Bushes, and we had seat belts in 1963.  The only sign of genuine emotion described in this whole "intimate portrait" comes not on 9/11, not on her wedding day, not when Laura's daughters were born, but when a former high-school sweetheart appears unexpectedly at a photo op.  "Her eyes were huge, and she had this look on her face as if she had just seen a ghost.  She was in shock," stated her press secretary.  Well, if I'd married George W. Bush, I'd hanker after my old boyfriends, too.   There are a number of errors in the bound galleys I read of this book, which I hope will be corrected.  In a marvelously Freudian slip, Kessler notes, "on March 19, 2001, the invasion of Iraq was imminent."  A more insensitive example of author error is how Leilani Akwai, a Yale classmate of W.'s, is referred to numerous times as "he" or "him" AFTER the former Peter Akwai completed transgender surgery.  The most egregious howler of this biography is trotted out in three-plus pages of pandering to Jewish voters, when Kessler insists that in 2001, Bush held the first Chanukah candle-lighting in the history of the White House.  Not so.  During the first year of the Clinton Administration, White House staffers, their children, and kids from a local Jewish after-school program joined Bill Clinton to celebrate Chanukah.  The tradition has continued to this day.  Conservative writer David Horowitz also has circulated the meme that W. was the first to light a chanukiah in the White House, but both he and Kessler are wrong.  Well, hey, maybe Laura Bush is as perfect as her slavish biographer says she is.  More likely, as Gertrude Stein wrote of her hometown, Oakland, California, "There is no there there."  As a reclusive, bookworm, wife and mother, I used to feel a tiny bit sorry for Laura Bush.    No more 
 It's a shame that these respected Agricultural Economists would allow such a poor example of a textbook to be published under their names.  While there may be some meagre updates, the book is so watered down that it is probably more appropriate to a high school class than college.  In addition, at 54 cents a page, its price far exceeds the price of most other quality books dealing with agriculture.  A decent faculty member would never, in good conscience, require that students purchase this book 
  Unfortunately, this book says more about the author than the subject. If you want a book that demonstrates a problem, illustrates a potential solution and its applications; then don't buy this. This is a very personal and hence cloudy view of the subject matter. There is some useful information in this book but it is hidden behind the grand philosophical statements or buried in the foot notes.  Has this author ever met an empirical scientist, rather than mathematicians or philosophers. Scientists love measuring things. No scientist would ask the question 'Is an apple red or green?' They would pose the question 'How much pigment (in milligrams) of each of a series of colours does each apple have?' Or in truth something far more obtuse. In fact the fuzzy logic treatment would be a bit black and white for most scientists.   I suspect that there is a great deal more to the subject that the author communicates and I felt a bit cheated that there was not more substance in this book.  Did I miss something? If I did then the book did not work to convey the subject. If I didn't then fuzzy logic is one of a myriad of tools to handle uncertainty, and thus is a small branch of probability.   
 Ansay gives us an anguished portrait of families trapped in a cycle of violence, stifled by religion and small-town culture. Ellen bucks the system by being a working mom, but when her husband loses his job must move in with her in-laws, and is exposed to their vitriol and dark secrets. This book is disturbing on a number of levels, and not for entertainment at all. I found the story extremely realistic but the ending all the more unsatisfying because although Ellen plans to escape, it leaves the guilty unpunished and the scars to her children unhealed. I'd rather have a happy ending,and I finished this book feeling sick. Two stars for gritty realism, but this isn't "light reading" or entertaining at all. Be warne 
 I purchased this pump for my sons inflatable pool.  We tried to pump it for over an hour.  Thought maybe was something was wrong with the pool. So I bought another inflatable pool (different type).  No, this pump does not pump at all.  
 I was very pleased with the book,"Wurthering Heights" and the service in sending it to me.   THank you. 
 Not only are the other comments on the printing quality correct, but the EXACT SAME BOOK EXISTS in a 2006 EDITION!!  The "Science of Sex" is the original(?) 1996 edition.  The 2006 edition of the VERY SAME BOOK is titled, "Sperm Wars: Infidelity, Sexual Conflict, and Other Bedroom Battles".  Explain to me why the author would reprint his original book under a new title?  Anyway, I'm returning this one, since I bought both books at the same time, thinking they had entirely different content. Furthermore the new edition is of much better printed quality, with none of the problems mentioned about this edition.  One more thing of note...the new edition is HALF THE PRICE of this crappy version!!!  Can't wait to actually read it

 Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us. 
 This book was very helpul in learning about how to handle my dog 
 After purchasing Pamela Ferrell's book Let's Talk Hair, I decided to buy this one for more styling options. I was suprised to see the horrible lack of information for hair care and hair styling. This book provides no information on a maintenance regime, the hair products section goes into great detail on all the chemicals and ingredients in products but doesn't tell how to choose products or what products on the market are good, and the styling section has little information for home styling. The author goes into great detail on hair makeup and on what actually is in hair products along with a very detail nutritional guide on all the ingredients in food. The hair styling section is basically about popular braiding styles and a few natural styles like the 'fro and the twist out 'fro, and some information on locking. Overall, don't waste your money or time on this book 
 Don't waste your time or money.   This book is full of hooey.  Pseudo-scientific drivel and an insult to serious economists everywhere. 
 First, let's begin with the premise that the collaberation of, at one time, in one relative place, and with (seemingly) one goal, those who have come to be collectively known as the Founding Fathers was, by any accounts, an extraordinary period in the history of humanity.  A Dream Team, if you will.  Second, let's remind ourselves that none of these men were devoid of their flaws.  Many, in retrospect, carried their warts and blemishes with a sense of pride, if not prominence.  While it is inevitable, and not inappropriate to find an interest in these founders and their various achievements so timely and exciting centuries after they did what they did, it is also inevitable that the lines of truth and accuracy have faded in the interim, and an honest interpretation of events between 1750 and 1820 requires of the interpretor an open mind, and a lack of preconceived notions.  Ms. Appleby has not satisfied that requirement in her Jefferson interpretation.  Appleby admits in the opening paragraphs to be an admirer, and continues to clarify that point throughout the book.  She sets Jefferson apart from the other 'founders,' who are minimized, if not dismissed as having provided less,if any substance to the drive for that ultimate goal.  Indeed, Appleby seems to be saying that the goals of the various gentlemen involved were so varied as to be in direct opposition to each other.  Moreover, Appleby outrightly idolizes Jefferson.  Her platitudes do not, however, shine any more light on the man, who certainly qualifies as one of the more secretive/introspective of the bunch.  Instead, one is left the option of accepting Jefferson as a Moses-like character, or of choosing to look elsewhere for a more in depth assessment of this certainly great man.  Other reviewers have noted her attention to Jefferson's issues with slavery, with women, with indians.  These are discussed, but rather than in a way that would try to find a root cause, or to compare them with other frailties in his character, the effort seems to be to offer them as some offset to the bulk of the material, which is close to hero worship.  There is enough information about Jefferson, even considering the depths of his persona, to identify some (but certainly not all) of the demons that tormented the man.  And also enough information to know that Jefferson was not immune to crossing the lines of decorum that separate the common man from the political climber.  But you wont find that discussion here.  In the end, we have yet another portrait of this man, who deserves his place in the pantheon, but ther is no flesh, no blood, no heart.  Just canvas 
    when the man sings, he sounds like he is blowing through an off key microphone.  The songs and lyrics are all so terribly written and sung, If you can call that singing at all 
 I have like 15 years playing guitar, and this dvd didn't show me nothing that I did'n know, only the last 20 minutes of the dvd were new for me, but not really enough. If someone ask for me, I say "NOT TO BUY THIS 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 I was not at all impressed with this CD. Boring. My husband didn't like it either 
 I thought it was good and sad. Sad because she didn't find her real mom. I think people should read it because it tells a lesson and it tells a happy ending 
 I was very disappointed with the content and layout of this book.  The amount of wasted pages for 'workspace' is excessive, but considering the lack of true content, I assume they needed to fill pages with something.  
 Pretty forgettable outing from the Surfers is almost totally comprised of conventional songs. A sad drop from the Latino Buggerveil glory days that true Surfer fans (such as myself) know and cherish. Some of the songs even sound like rip-offs of earlier Surfer tunes: "Cough Syrup" sounds distressingly similar to "I Saw an X-Ray of a Girl Passing Gas".   Pretty sad, in all. The Butthole Surfers remain one of the great experimental rock bands of all time. Their first four albums are towering acheivements, but "Electric Larryland" isn't even close to being in the same class. Gone is the psychotic menace and disorienting fever of "Psychic Powerless", "Rembrandt Pussyhorse" and "Locust Abortion...". Even the freak-out songs on the album ("My Brother's Wife") are a little tired and sound more like someone trying (in vain) to imitate early surfers.   I will always respect and love and follow this great band, but this is not one of their best albums, nor is it an album for a prospective fan to start with. Pick up one of their first four releases or "Humpty Dumpty" instead. 
 First of all, isn't there something to be said for aesthetics when it comes to covers?  Well, then, the cover definitely has to be altered.  Maybe they could put a picture of a house plant on there or something to represent this guy's personality.  Secondly, the book tries to take itself way too seriously.  and C. Polite? Timid? Is this guy supposed to be funny. I thought  he was a serious art critic, then I start in and he's talking all this politix crapola.  Is this guy a comedian or not?  I thought he had a show on amazon. I once saw him do stand-up comedy and he was funny.  He talked about funny things.  But here, this ain't no pulitzer writing 'dat for for sure. Maybe he try again, but I afraid his publisher no like any more and he have to self-publish, mebbee.  I'd rather read Dr. Seuss -- this fox ain't got no sox and his ham and egss is done greened on him 
 A friend of me, who lives in Europe, lent this book to me, some months ago.I'm an agronomist and I live in Brazil.As an agronomist, I found this book so bad, that I didn't read all of it. On chapter 5, this book claims that "Green Revolution" wasn't an answer.In fact the "Green Revolution" gave food fo billions of people in the world.Today, because of modern agronomy there's more per capita food than any other time in world history. On chapter 7, this book is against free market, as a good solution.Well even recognizing the failures of free market, I should tell you that any other possiblity is far worse.We must remember that Lenin, Stalin,Hitler and Mao Tse-Tung killed more than 100,000,000 people, by hungry.And any of these marxist was using "free market" to produce all this famine. In fact,modern agronomy ( mecanization, fertilizers, bigger farms, transgenic seeds,etc.) gave to the mankind better and cheaper food. Another fact is that old agriculture produces food at a very high price and low quality also.If we return to agriculture from about 100 years ago, the majority of world population will be sentenced to death by famine.  Claiming absurds about agriculture, this book can be used as a fertilizer 
 FYI, this guy is not a real Indian-he is a white man pretending.  That's been proven by DNA. And he was never a member of a tribe, it was "honorary" and was taken away.  The AIM movement came out and said they don't want him speaking for them, that he's a "wanabee" and that they don't like his racism. If you don't believe me, go to their website.  They have a whole section on him and others like him.  That kind of make me not want to read anymore of his books.  I full believe that what was done to the Indians was very wrong, but I'd like to hear about it from a genuine source-like an actual Indian historian, not some fake who apparently hates his own race.  This is not a "victims" perspective at all.  He's not the victim 
 Don't get me wrong... the music on this CD is certainly great stuff. However, it's Cracker's old label trying to cash in on old songs, and nothing more. Personally, I'd just buy all the albums to get these songs, because there are great songs otherwise- but if you are looking for a greatest hits album, go with Cracker - Greatest Hits Redux, also available from Amazon.com, and it comes with a better variety, live variations of their songs, and the great "Ain't Gonna Suck Itself" which is directed at the very corporate scum that put this album here out. 
 I found this book to repetitive.  It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates.  Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all.  It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC.  One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid.  She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you 
 I found the  Betty Crocker cookbook for kids was limited in actual recipes. I had thought of it for my 11yr old granddaughter but when I received it I was very disappointed in fact I returned it because even for my 7 year old grandson it was too basic. The recipes were things they already cooked. Way too much reading and too little recipes. Not a great job from Betty Crocker 
 I purchased this book after looking at several on the web.  Of course all you get to see is the index.  The index for this book looked great so I ordered it.  It is filled cover to cover with general philosophy and no real application or even a difinitive solution to a problem.  Even trying to edeucate yourself on a pinpoint subject matter requires going through several chapters to get the whole scoop.  I'd gladly sell mine back at a loss, but I like bon fires 
 Sorry, but this isn't much of a book. Only 160 pages without the index and other stuff in the back, mostly self-promotion by a few architects of their own projects -- ok, some nice hotels and good color pictures in the middle -- only a little technical information.  Other books have much more content, or more pictures of a wider variety of hotels/resorts. Way too expensive for what you get 
 I TOTALLY agree with "A Reader" that posted on January 10, 2004... titled." What Would Sue Monk Kidd Do?" This reviewer captured my thoughts exactly. WHY would anyone want to read a spiritual book written by a woman who abandoned her Christianity? Please! This author has one book that is good..."The Secret Life of Bees," and it's fiction! Stick with fiction, Ms. Kidd. You seem to do it in your own spiritual life, so writing it should be simple. 
 This book is oh, so retro...blaming working mothers and romanticizing the mom who sacrifices her career & interests to coddle her "fragile" kids 24/7.  It's basically the same trite backlash junk  that circulated in the 80's that if you work, you can't love your kids.   Get real, Brenda, it's the 90's 
 I have read about 10 real estate investment books within the last 6 months, and despite the Amazon.com user reviews, this book probably was the least informative, least well written, and least organized of the lot.  The author refers to his real estate investment experience several times throughout the book, yet he discusses only the single property he has purchased, disqualifying him as a mentor in my mind.  He write without technicality, and fills much of the book quoting other "real estate gurus" and citing summaries of text he has read.  I am really surprised that this book was rates so highly on this site, because it really has been a disappointment and waste of time.  By the way, some of the best books I have read have been written by Dolf De Roos.  Best of luck to you all 
 RARE SMOKE The Ultimate Guide To Pipe Collecting sounds like a reference book for pipe collecting.  I have reference books on other subjects for collectors.  Compared to these other books, I have the following comments on RARE SMOKE.  First, this is a reference book that DOES NOT HAVE AN INDEX.  The photographs are of low quality.  There are photos that are so blurred that one cannot see the detail that they were included to illustrate.  The content is very limited.  Many manufacturers and models are not included.  And dating and pricing most of the limited number of pipes that are included is not possible 
 I think they are too stiff for comfort.  I do like the short finger, but the material over the back of the hand is too stiff. I thought it would stretch out and soften a bit. But it hasn't.  Protects the hands well through off road trails though. 
 The premise of the book -- scientists trying to contact the near past in order to divert environmental disaster -- is interesting.  The premise and the alternate version of the present might have even been fascinating except that the ideas are overwhelmed by much too much text, unnecessary plot developments, incredibly boring detail, and characters you don't much care about.  Of all the many, many books I've read in my life, I have purposely not finished only a very few -- but this was one of them.  I was just too disinterested to continue reading 
 I really couldn't wait to get this CD.  I wanted so badly to like it.  But - it is just too bluegrassy for me.  Every single song.  It would be great one or two songs, but every song gets old.  Plus, the recording quality doesn't seem that great.  You can barely hear the words, and most kids want to sing along.  Jenny Jenkins is a fun song, and Shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful, but For the Kids and NO! are way better CD's 
 Dean Koontz delivers a rocky build-up to the closing scenes in Sole Survivor, but it ultimately stumbles badly on the hocus-pocus of evil government with good science & stock chase scenes pulled from only the worst of B-movies.  The main character, Joe Carpenter, is lost in a world without his wife and daughters, who were killed in a mysterious plane crash. But a chance meeting with a woman photographing the gravesite, who briefly tells Carpenter about the crash, leads to a shoot-em-up with the woman nearly being killed by her pursuers.  The reader then enters a realm of mediocre sci-fi as Carpenter, a former crime reporter for a major daily newspaper, begins to piece together snippets of clues to find out for himself what happened during the crash and if any of his family actually survived.  Family members with loved ones killed in the crash are visited by the mystery woman. Many of the people then become victims, killing themselves in violent ways, but are seemingly at peace while acting on the whim. As Carpenter closes in on revealing the secret, the good versus evil falls into the lap of big government, a big corporation and the mystery woman who knows everything.  If Koontz wanted the book to read like a draft for a possible X-Files episode, then he was successful. But even the producers of that once highly successful program would have needed several pens to edit a story that had so much potential, only to fail due to Koontz ultimately plummeting into the world of cliches.   
 hi my name is alicia i am a high school senior and had to read this book i had to tell a summary and i could not how could i tell a summary of letters plays and her thoughts i needed help and if there is anyone out there  reading it for school i would not recommend you read it at all its good but  not that good to get a F fo 
 Another left-wing, hippie idiot who dropped out of any sort of real career in 1975 has to sustain himself by writing this anti-technology dystopic rubbish.  I'm sure that he has plenty of ideological fellow travelers in Hollywood with whom he should team up to make another version of "12 Monkeys" or "The Fight Club."  This is just left-wing, nihilist, anti-human rubbish motivated by a hatred of humanity and mans' productive capacity.    Like, the world ended when we ran out of trees to burn as fuel?  I'm sure that trees were cheaper than coal for 15th or 16th century Britain, but they made the transition from one energy source to another without resorting to cannabilism or having their civilization self-destruct like this author would have us believe.  The collapse of civilizations is not tied to the end of cheap energy, but is more likely due to a descent into decadence and sloth.  If there is not enough oil, we can switch to coal, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and nuclear (fission or fusion-in the future).    All these self-styled futurists are just full of rubbish and make predictions which they then sell to an ignorant public just so they can pay their rent.  Most science fiction is garbage and this just proves my point.  How many science fiction authors in the early 1980's or before predicted the emergence of the internet?  Almost none by my estimate.  Don't waste your money helping this guy pay his rent.  He's a nihilist and misanthrope.    As long as men are free to think, communicate and trade, long-term optimism is the order of the day as the secular trend for civilization is always upwards and onwards 
 OK, I know I'm going to get hammered for this; once again, there goes my reviewer rating. But I just HAVE to be honest: this is a terrible story. OK, being that it's Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story, and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a "happy" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that Kate has actually "triumphed" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly consider it a "happy" anding, and personally, I see little evidence of it.  No, what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there IS a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who "Tames" her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her, simply starves her and sleep-deprives her, as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants, up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives. Her spirit may or may not be broken, depending on how the part is played, but the fact remains that she's forced to BEHAVE as if it is, and that's not a message that should be bruited about in a "comedy". This is absolutely the WORST of Shakespeare's plays 
 i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it.  i find it a nightmare!  if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out.  it does not work when on the charger.  it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts. what a piece of junk.  I would in no way recommend this product to anyone 
 I always thought 'Back to the heavyweight jam' was crap, but this cd has proven me wrong. Hardly any good songs what so ever. The single 'I'm your pusher' is probably the best song on the cd but not any good compared to scooter's earlier work. I myself am a big scooter fan and i own all of their albums, but this is just bad. If you wanna listen to good german dance music i recommend scooters earlier albums like: 'No time to chill',  'Wicked!',  'Our happy hardcore', '..And the beat goes on', 'The age of love' and their singles album; 'Rough and tough and dangerous'. Buy one of these instead of 'Sheffield' and their second newest album; 'Back to the heavyweight jam' 
 This item is not worth the money spent on it.  You can not use boiling water and the steam does not last any time at all.  You do better heating water in a cup in the microwave and breathing that steam.  You can put the Vicks strips or whatever in your cup of water.  This is not a good product in my books.  Thanks 
 My daughter was thrilled to see a new Wheel of Fortune game out and we bought it immediately! It's quite abit smaller than the original..can't imagine why they would do that..and it already has problems with the bonus round!  We may just have a bad one..but my daughter has gone back to using the 20 year old one she has..even with the faded screen and weak sound 
 Not a very believable thriller, the field agent who only did research now can take out terrorists with a gun?  And without combat training, he continues to survive assassination attempts?  I found the dialogue repetitive and old-fashioned...who writes "he would have called his wife, but he didn't want to quarrel with her"?  On top of that, there seemed to be a big focus on smoking (maybe Silva has a product placement contract w/Benson & Hedges and Marlboro?).  I didn't care about the characters at the end and felt as if this was too easily written...like a movie where everything conveniently happens in the protagonist's favor.  Vince Flynn's writing is much tighter and more thrilling, and his characters have much more depth.  
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 I've been doing business in China for more than 10 years.  I believe most readers would benefit from reading some other books ("China, Inc." and "Chinese Business Etiquette", old and revised, but still a great basic resource, and the HBR's "On Doing Business in China").  As I drag myself painfully through "China Streetsmart", I can't help to wonder if Mr. Chan decided to spin a piece of quickly put together stories hoping his last name would sell the book. 
 Marcus Borg has given good scholarly effort and quality research to this book.  The format is reader-friendly and has some good thought provoking statements from both Jesus and Buddah.  All of this being said, spiritual seekers should use much caution in reading this book. I am a follower of Jesus Christ, He has transformed my life which is something no one, including myself, could do.  In his introductory remarks Mr. Borg calls himself a "non-exclusive" Christian, which to me is contradictory to Jesus' remarks in John 14:6 where He says, "I am the way, the truth and the life no one comes to the Father except by me."   It is for this reason that I give the book 2 stars and didn't finish it 
 The cover and overviews make reference to Glasser's book being supported by facts.  So, I was looking forward to it.  Unfortunately, it is short on facts and long on his opinions.    Such as where he states that "PERHAPS up to 50% of schizophrenics recover without medical help."  Perhaps???  That's a very glib statement supported by a "perhaps."    In one case where he cites a health statistic, it covers the period "from the 1930s to the 1990s" and is used to discredit medications.  His citing of such shows a disregard for evidence or his being terribly out of date in the medical field.  I suspect it is the latter.  Information from the 1930s and 40s and 50s??  That was the "dark ages" for most all medications, let alone for  psychiatric medications which have only begun to have treatment break throughs in the 1990s.   Referencing info from then is like saying "we proved in 1805 that mankind could not build airplanes that fly, so why don't people stop trying to build them."  A careful reading of what is written and how it is written seems to indicate that he has reached a foregone conclusion and is picking and choosing some evidence to support his opinion.  But mainly he uses argument and rhetoric to support it.  Don't bother with this book.  It's another one of those "I'm the only man in the world who knows anything, so buy my book. 
 To the guy below: you found this in the "hardcore/punk" section because Throwdown is a hardcore band...  No matter how many mediocre attempts they take at metal, they are always going to be a hardcore band first and foremost 
 I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 This is literally in the top 3 worst movies of all-time. Complete waste of time and life that I will never get back because of watching this crap. There's always some other movie, or show, or what have you that is a lot better than this 
 This is a case where the book is wonderful and the movie is just pathetic.  I hadn't read the book before seeing the movie.  The film stunk.  A few years later, I read the book and was enchanted.  I did not make the connection that this was the same story until I saw the film again on late night tv.  I was all excited to see one of my favorite books on the screen.  Then, I realized what movie it was.  I tried to sit through it.  I just couldn't.  The monster should have eaten the film 
 The concept of a futon mattress atop slats is actually comfortable and I lay on it for a week happily until I made the mistake of putting too much focused pressure and snapped/broke two of the very fragile slats by climbing onto it with my knee first.  Also, I called the manufacturer on the first day to tell them that the filling inside the cushion covers was making me itch.  These are not cushions with a black cover.  This is a black cover filled with recycled fabric pulp.  The rep was not interested in responding to my complaint.  Don't buy this.  Go to a futon store and buy something that resembles this and it will be much sturdier. 
 I think the author is a brilliant physicist with some incredible ideas, but he sure didn't express them in this book.  As stated by others, there a various anecdotes (many which are funny and enlightening), but most without real relevance.  I bought the book to learn about his ideas, but alas this book seems to be written for someone with a significant background in the subject matter already. My rating is really based on the readability (which is poor) since the book did such a poor job of relating his ideas I can't judge those 
 This was my first book by Pickover, and it will be my last.  His chapters can be entertaining, but ultimately they lead nowhere, and cast no light into the dark corners of the universe.  For a scientist and self-proclaimed skeptic, he seems a bit enamoured with new age mysticism.  In one chapter, he talked about writing down and trying to achieve 100 goals in life.  If one of his goals was to write a pointless, self-promoting book, he can check that goal off his list 
 I agree with poster who stated that these entries were superficial.  Personally, I think Steven Heller is ruining graphic design.  These entries are incredibly anti-intellectual and not very well researched.  It doesn't elevate Graphic Design at all above the cool, hip and commercial.  Surely this field is worth a little more than that?  Don't buy it 
 The publisher should be convinced that the automatic spell checker should not be so heavily relied upon.  The cover art is an expression of how an armchair graphic artist can be innovative with Photoshop.  If a book of such high esteem be put out for public enrichment its presentation should not be so insincere 
 A good dozen years before his spectacular films of the late 70's and mid 80's Allen got his name on the directorial map w/ this piece of fluff.  You gotta start somewhere.  Tiger Lily is more of a dry run for his later, real comedies than an original film in its own right.  Allen's early work does tend to be stand up material thinly disguised as film.  Many of the jokes are funny but the one note premise wears thin quick.  A must for Allen enthusiasts and people who like quirky cultish so-bad-they're-fun movies 
 I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5.  In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films.  The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series.  It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it.  I think they could pull off one more film.  Ripley's a great hero.  This movie was pretty bad.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects.  I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien.  Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money.  The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent.  Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement.  This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair. 
 I don't recommend buying this book if you, like I, are a fan of Jez's other Duck Books: Duck in a Truck, Fix It Duck, and Captain Duck.  The whole book is about 7 pages long and each page is the duck making a single comment about his lost key (one liners) and has a flap which hides the frog, who also says a one liner.  Maybe a two year old who has never been read the afore mentioned books will enjoy lifting the flaps but this book has none of the humor, does not have the Sheep or Goat, does not have the catchy rhythm, and has none of the originality of Jez`s prior works.  Fortunately Amazon has an excellent return policy and this book is going right back.  Also, there is no glossy cover for the book.  This just isn't up to the other Duck books.  I was quite disappointed.  
 Literary coincidences occur occasionally, and this year's coincidence is the appearance of two novels about Henry James, both written by authors hailing from countries east of the Atlantic. (The other novel is David Lodge's Author, Author; I'll review that book here soon.) It is as if James has been appropriated by Irish and British authors, having been largely ignored by those of his native America for so long. James, who became a British citizen at the end of his life, spent most of his productive years in England and continental Europe. It is no surprise that his fiction has a European flavor, nor is it any surprise that he is such a beacon for British and Irish writers.  The Master in question is old Henry himself, who, in the final period of his life, has received this nickname from critics in praise of the quality of his prose and plots (James was arguably the greatest American author of his period; I confess to being a James fan myself, and even have a print of his portrait, painted by John Singer Sargeant, on the wall next to my desk).   At this time, Henry attempted to break into the theater, with the belief that he would not only achieve recognition from the general public but also the fortune that accompanies such success. In the way writers want to sell scripts to Hollywood today, James wanted to sell his stories to the London theater. Alas, it was a failure; a resounding failure, one that shook James' resolve and faith in himself.   Tibn is clearly a Jamesophile, yet he portrays old Henry as a socially inept, somewhat confused old man, who is uncomfortable at dinners and balls, and who longs for his preferred solitude, which he eventually finds in the house he purchases in the small town of Rye. While some may claim that this is a valid portrayal of James, though exaggerated, Tibn neglects to provide the book with a plot, and instead merely relates a series of incidents and events in Henry's life. While Tibn's writing is agreeable-it is, naturally, somewhat Jamesian-his story has little interest. Seen as a series of vignettes, cobbled together with flashbacks to try and put some depth into the story, Tibn shows James far too incompletely to make a novel that works.   For Tibn seems obsessed with showing examples of James' alleged homosexuality, going as far as inventing an incident with Oliver Wendell Holmes, when the two of them shared a bed in their youth. Recent years have seen many "scholars" suggesting that James is homosexual, though the evidence is of the "they have weapons of mass destruction" type. In fact, after reading this book, with its unsuccessful denouement, one wonders if Tibn simply wanted to present this hypothesis in a fictional form, and filled in the rest so there would be something worth publishing.   Tibn does little more than fill in spaces around events described by Leon Edel in his monumental biography of Henry James. By fleshing out these events, Tibn does give more life to them than Edel does, but is it worth it? To me, having read Edel recently, and being familiar with James' work, the book seemed to drag on, as I hoped to find some sort of narrative thread in the work. But I was not fortunate; Tibn simply relates events, albeit occurring within a specific period, without doing more than adding dialog and inner impressions to the characters actions.   But this raises a deeper question about such a book. That a writer of Tibn's ilk could simply create a docu-drama of some events in a real person's life suggests that he is in a period of plotter's block. It is relatively simple to depend on reality, and add a few strokes of dialog, and while it is oft said that truth is stranger than fiction, in this case, the truth doesn't provide for an interesting read. James' life was certainly remarkable, yet decidedly uneventful. And Tibn's choice of telling a part of that story in this manner falls flat, in part because there is no real denouement.   Many reviewers seem to be fawning over this book, using such panegyrics as "the literary novel of the summer." But it seems that these critics are jaded, and willingly accept anything that has a "classical" background in order to escape the banality of much contemporary fiction. Henry James was an extraordinary writer, an exceptional man, in his own manner, and his life is quite a story, but he is poorly served by this "novel", which seems to be little more than an exercise in fictionalizing such a man's life. This book will certainly appeal to the boobs (as Mencken called them), who find it just the right thing to make them look smart, but readers looking for a good book would be better off picking up some of the Master's work and ignoring Tibn. 
 This book is a waste of money! I am currently an under-grad looking for some tutorial help for my Quantum course and purchased the book without reviewing Amazon's feedback reviews. Wish I would have done so before I bought it. Although this book provides some example questions with solutions, they are few. And the chapter problems don't have any answers to examine. This author or publisher needs to re-think their approach 
 If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy 
 Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected. I didn't really connect with the main characters. I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story. 
 The book is full of nonsense that should be simple common sense to anyone that has worked in the business world.  Mostly this book is a chance for the author to talk of his many "high level" meetings and for him to boast about all of the execs and sports figures that he knows.  This book is rather entertaining, but you will not gain much from it in the way of business or management knowledge 
 Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down.  It was almost aggravating 
  Having just turned 25 and naturally, needing a book to tell me what the hell to do about it, I picked this up. For me, Quarterlife Crisis coasts more on its merits of inherently interesting and familiar subject matter than the contents of the book itself. For all 198 pages it has this anecdotal, unstructured, almost gossipy feel to it where the authors make one point (usually a pretty obvious one), then spend the next 20 pages circumventing the subject instead of really expanding on it or providing a solution. There are pockets of insight here and there, but most of the comfort and usefulness of reading this book ended where it started: knowing that my concerns affected others.  Having been written by women, I have a feeling it will appeal more to female readers. We guys need a stronger dose of logic and insight to be satisfied 
 My book group chose this book by the interesting description here and review.  The idea of a spinster leaving her family to become a witch intrigued us all, but we were disappointed in the book.  We found the character not very interesting, and the lack of action calmed us all into slumber while trying to read it.  It wasn't a terrible book, it had some interesting things to say, but we could not understand all the immensely positive reviews here 
 if you have fond memories of ms steele, or no memory at all because you're new to her, please... don't read this book.  liam looks like a child with his long blond hair; he acts up because no one can control him since that's what his parents tried to do to him; he sees any "no" as a slap in the face because once again, that's what his parents did to him.  sasha looks like a cold woman with her pale skin and dark hair always pulled back; she is totally concerned about her reputation: "but what will they think of me?" and can't stand up for her needs; she refuses to lower her standards, but when liam leaves, she falls into a "morbid depression" and goes back to him.  repeat for 300 pages...   "careless," "self-indulgent," "filler" are three words i'd use to describe it 
 I bought these for a 13 year-old for Christmas.  The package was impossible to open.  I forgot batteries.  When we got the batteries, we learned that you can only play drum with one stick, you have to play cymbals with the other.  So you cannot use them to simply drum!  They do not work at all if you use them to tap on a surface, so you must air drum.  Also, one of the two sticks missed every third or fourth beat.  This product is as disappointing as it could possibly be 
 Received this as a gift this Christmas and must say I was disappointed all things considered.  I found it lovely to look at, but not much beyond that 
 4 String's first album "Believe" has many great moments - well worth the purchase. I have to agree with the other 2 reviews though that this album is rather disappointing. To point out a few worthwhile listens here: "Until You Love Me" recalls the great feel of "Believe", and the single "Turn it Around" is good as well. "Free" is also not bad... You can find "Turn it Around" on collections by Ultra, so I'd recommend buying those before you purchase this album 
 This book has at least 10 authors and is fun to read for the first few chapters. Then I really got annoyed to read the same things over and over again and at the same time I missed some more in depth explanations. A lot is done with the framework itself. This is probably due to the very early delivery date of the book. Though I really enjoyed the C# example (game of life) I think you be better served with Hollis, Lhotka "VB.Net Programming". Also there seem to be quite a few other books out by now 
 The title sounds perfect for me, but I found this book very frustrating. Much of it is paraphrased man pages, and there are very few actual examples. This is frustrating when you have to really study, say, the  regular expression syntax, when a simple example would do wonders instead.  I do use this book occassionally for quick reference, but otherwise look  elsewhere 
 I am a fan of Oscar Wilde and of BBC productions, but to make Wilde's plays and stories boring takes either special effort, or decided lack of effort.  I've bought this dvd but it's unlikely I'll ever watch it again.  The stagy and low-budget sets are to be expected from older BBC tv productions; the costumes are very nice. Sound and picture qualities are excellent.  The actors are mostly very good especially Susan Hampshire and Jeremy Brett in "Ideal Husband", who each provide provide sorely-needed beauty,youth, and especially, energy. (The overaged Mrs Cheavely acts well, but is miscast).  But the pacing and direction of each production is so dull, that I found myself just wanting these to end quickly.  The "Earnest" is so slow and boring as to be the most unwatchable of the group, and that should be a criminal offense 
 This book will teach you the basics. iT does not prepare you for the test. I read the whole book cover to cover and understood it completely. The test is nowhere as easy as this books questions. It does not go into depth with scenerios that can be helpful. I recommend you get the microsoft books for this test. If you are currently working with 2003 it will help alot. but do not plan to only use this book unless you luck up and get the perfectly tailored test to what this books covers 
 I've enjoyed Michael Thomas Ford's writing in the past, but this story is poorly written, poorly edited and extremely shallow.  I couldn't help but think that Ford was just cranking out a story to meet a deadline.  There's no depth of character in any of the main figures.  The story line seems to serve no purpose other than to connect the over abundant and graphic sex scenes, some of which are extremely brutal.  If your looking for a good story with believable characters...keep looking for it 
 To rehash about 2,000 other reviews: this book is tripe.  Worthless.  Offensive to anyone who felt any connection to this series' world and characters.  I think I may have a pretty good idea of what happened, though, and I hope it gives some hope for the future.  It's the Michael Crichton syndrome.  Remember long ago, when Michael Crichton wrote extremely entertaining novels based wholly on his strengths?  He is obviously very bright, and has a real talent for turning ideas about hard-science into fun dramas, like The Andromeda Strain.  Then he became so popular, and so lauded, that he started to believe his own hype.  He read so many reviews of his own books citing him as the greatest writer ever, and as the man whose every word was golden, that he started to believe it.  And so he started to write books filled with what he thought was subtle intrigue, pithy character interaction, and literary depth.  Unfortunately, he wasn't that kind of writer.  He wasn't Delillo, or Dickens, or Wolfe, and he shouldn't have tried to be.  So those books ended up being further towards the 'crappy' end of the spectrum.  Then something happened - I don't know if his editors pulled in the reigns, or if his family sat him down to have a talk, or maybe he started to pay attention to the fans that he was disappointing (I hope).  Whatever it was, it got him to accept a bit of humility, and to go back to his strengths.  The results being Timeline, and then Prey - fun books about hard-science extrapolated into entertaining dramas.  So therein lies my hope for Robert Jordan.  His strengths are in describing an interesting world, in creating things that are mysterious and engaging, and in writing very cool action sequences.  Recently he seems to think he's the next F. Scott Fitzgerald; and failing spectacularly.  He obviously, for example, thinks that he has something deeply important to say about the sexes and about the clash of cultures, and maybe he does, but he sucks at saying it.  More importantly, IT'S NOT WHY WE READ THE WHEEL OF TIME.  If we want to read about the subtleties of culture and its affect on the interactions we have, there's plenty of Dostoevsky available.  Mr. Jordan obviously possesses a stubbornness akin to that he ascribed to the people of the home village of his protagonists (whoever they are anymore).  I just hope that eventually someone will smack him hard enough to wake him up, and we'll find ourselves with another "Eye of the World" or "The Great Hunt" 
 At the young age of 25 Julie Barenson loses her husband. Shortly after he dies, a great dane puppy is delivered to her home with a note from her late husband. This part will give you the chills ... nice touch.  She names him Singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other.   After a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, Julie begins dating 2 men--Richard, a handsome charmer who wines & dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship. The other, Mike, is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger, Doritos & a couple beers at the local watering hole.  So who would you choose? Ouch! I'll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story.  Instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot.  I cannot believe this is the same author who wrote The Notebook, one of my all time favorite novels. I'll have to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears.  In conclusion, Singer not only saved his owner but the book as well. 
 I started reading the book as a part of my personal development with the company that I work for. The book is founded in behaviorism, and does not stray from the concepts associated with this worldview. My issue with it is that I believe that people are more than a reaction to the things that happen to us. We have unique personalities, and they consist of more than the conditioning that they are subjected to. This psychology takes away the idea of free-will and choice, and eliminates personal responsibility. When it comes to managing people, I believe that these are important elements to tap into. This behaviorist approach to management may look good on the surface, and make logical sense, but is flawed by its nature, and cannot have any long lasting impact 
 shipment is excellent, but...the CD-ROM is not working... I need to replace it ASAP! Whatshould I do 
 BORING.  I started to read about the Dow Theory with old fashioned charts of defunct stocks. There are supplements to the text to bring in modern stocks, but maybe one should retire this book 
 Reviewers called it funny, heartfelt, painful, revealing, and honest.  I'd agree with painful.  Honestly, I couldn't even finish it, I made it to almost the end of chapter 5, up to page 60.  After 60 pages of descriptive narrative, with NO dialogue, I gave up.  I get the anger, and I guess delving into her parent's childhoods was going to lead somewhere, but I couldn't follow.  It just all seemed very pointless, and uninspired, and far from a unique tale, that needed to be told, or else one that didn't need to be published.  Life's too short to read boring books 
 In this novel, Ha Jin writes like a Chinese Michel Houllebecq- the language is simple and direct, and the ultimate outlook for humanity is grim. The protagonist is also a shy young male on the outer rim of the mainstream community.  Like a lot of the modern Chinese fiction, the novel is preoccupied with the psychological damage inflicted by China's Communist years, and the paranoia and self-censorship that occurs to this day. The year is 1989, and the narrator's teacher, Wang, has just had a severe stroke. The narrator, Jian, is studying for the PhD candidacy exams; he is a student of classical Chinese poetry and hopes to be granted a PhD so that he can move to Beijing to live with his fiancee Meimei, who is his teacher's daughter.  Wang's stroke has left him raving and mad. Jian is assigned by the university secretary to care for Wang while he is in hospital. During Jian's afternoons spent in the hospital room, he is audience to his teacher's ravings, which begin to reveal all sorts of disturbing truths that had managed to stay hidden until that point.  The story is set against the backdrop of the student activism leading up to the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. Toward the end of the novel, Jian becomes so disillusioned by his teacher's revelations that he decides to forfeit the PhD exams, resulting in Meimei's breaking up with him. Aimless, he travels to Beijing and takes part briefly in the student demonstrations. Amid the violence, he is lucky enough to find his way back to the train station to return to his university in Shanning. Upon return he is informed that he is about to be taken away for his role in the Beijing demonstrations, and the novel ends with him on the run, having been forced by circumstances to abandon his belongings, his friends, and his identity.  The stark language with which the ending is rendered makes it all the more appalling. The matter-of-factness with which Jian takes the steps to erase himself from his previous life suggests the ordinariness of his actions in such extraordinary times. 
 The subject of the is book is very interesting, so I struggled through to the end (with plenty of skimming), but this guy can't tell a story.  Too dry, too long, no sense of style.  Tayloe Nicke 
 While reading this I realized that Blood Games holds the dubious distinction of being the worst book I have ever read. Forget for a moment that it is not scary and is in fact BORING-Laymon wrote this book as if from the point of view of a hormonal 13 year- old boy in the 1950s who wants to be a writer when he grows up but doesn't know yet that he has no talent! These grown women (college graduates) do and say things I've never seen or heard any other woman do. They talk like men (or perhaps 13 year old boys) and use language I haven't heard in atleast 25 years. I was bored to tears by all the talk about their bare body parts (no-these were not sexual situations.) No, women do not frequently hang out naked together for no reason, No, we do not walk naked in the woods because it's TOO HOT to wear a tank top, No, I did not finish this book and No I will not try another Laymon 
 Boy is this band lame or what? The songs are slow, not catchy and she can't even sing. Jon, go back to Eve 6 and make some real quality music again!! EVE 6 ROCKS! 
 This is when of those albums where about halfway through each song you say "when is this gonna get going?" and none of them ever do.  It's like slow-motion bland-pop 
 I can usually enjoy Diana Palmer's stories but why do they always have to include the innocent virgin and the arrogant male?  This makes it a little too unrealistic.  As the other reviewers stated, this book has way too much going on and not enough interaction with the main characters 
 I've had these speakers for three years now. Hissing, popping, not holding signal-- all that has been true from day 1. And tonight, one of the speakers just would not turn on. The power supply wasn't the problem-- it's something inside the speaker box, and something that apparently cannot be fixed.  So my other one will be mono until I can come up with an alternative solution.  Oh well.. 
 Johnson presents seven "edicts" for fixing education - an appropriate choice of words since she offers little/no justification for them. Let's take a look at some of them -  1)No classroom shall have more than 20 students. Sounds so easy, intuitively makes so much sense. Except it doesn't work. Most research supporting smaller classes is based on confounding expenditures with parental socio-economic class. High socio-economic parents both contribute better genes and home environments to their children; they also typically spend more on education (especially for reduced class size). Thus, simplistic analyses conclude (somehow) that reduced class size is "the cure." More sophisticated analyses, demonstrated by Hanushek, Coleman, and others, is that WHEN PARENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE HELD CONSTANT reduced class size contributes very little if anything to improving pupil outcomes.  Other facts suggest the same conclusion, and don't require sophisticated analyses: a)Asian children almost always outscore Americans - despite much larger classes. b)Jewish and Asian children in America score much higher than other groups. c)Thirty years of decreasing class size, etc. has accomplished NOTHING - National Assessment of Educational Progress results for 17-year-olds have been essentially unchanged, as have dropout rates. d)There is more variation in pupil achievement WITHIN SCHOOLS THAN BETWEEN THEM - thus, school factors cannot possibly dominate pupil outcomes.  4)Begin to deflate the bureaucratic bloat. Absolutely correct. However, her methodology is silly - eg. try a week w/o the Supt. and if things are still running smoothly get rid of him/her. Any competent Supt. will create an organization that can survive w/o him/her for a week. The real problem is in middle-management - consultants, coordinators, supervisors for everything under the sun. Get rid of all of them, except perhaps in the largest districts. They simply diffuse responsibility, add costs, and reduce teachers' achievement motivation.  7)Stop the testing frenzy. Cease the accountability testing of licensed teachers. Really - experts on Japanese education success attribute much of it to "high-stakes testing." How else does one evaluate teachers, curricula, etc.?   Reality is that parents are the prime determinants of pupil success. They need to take charge of their children, and stop thinking this role can be delegated. 
 Kelly Preston and Tcheky Karyo are a New York City couple who come together after Preston leaves Matthew Broderick and Karyo uses Meg Ryan in order to get a Visa. Now Broderick and Ryan are teaming up to get even with their ex's. The problem is, the offenses they've endured (being dumped and being used) don't really warrant the horrible things they do to these two people, especially Karyo. Which is probably why first-time director Griffin Dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles. After all, how can we not root for Ferris Bueller and Harry's Sally? Unfortunately, it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive, the pace of the film is so uneven, and the script isn't particularly funny.   There's a difference between black comedy and just mean-spirited comedy. Despite a handful of amusing moments and a few nice cinematic touches, this film does not walk that line very well 
 I won't waste much typing on this review.  The title says it all.  With about 3 new Magic editions released since this book was published, don't waste a cent on this stinker (8th Edition due out in July 2003).  It was great when first released, but thye need to get on the ball and write a new one 
 It has nothing but pre-published photos we have all seen before in magazines. The tats aren't even shown. They talk about how Angelina has a lot of them but they don't even list them all. Not made for the true tattoo enthusist. A coffee table book at best. It describes their crazy childhoods more than the tats 
 Bwowsing thru this book, one can only think the author has either (1) been sleeping, or (2) hiding under a rock for the past 5 years or so! As far as the wonderful "Bring em On" ,"Mission Accomplished" "Achievements" regarding the Iraq catastrophe, this author should go over there himself unescorted, and go between the Green Zone and Airport, the world's most dangerous area! So you lie about your dad's enemy, slaughter thousands of innocents, each dying his/her own horrible death, sponsored by Bush & Co..This is success!.Anyone with even a 9th grade education knows that revenge will explode its ugly head, as it has in Iraq, and here after 9/11/01, an event which some people still think was Saddam's doing, thanks to the continual lies of Bush % Co..And Katrina, a total disaster showing this GOP administration true incompetent and ignorant colors. Hey, so a great US city drowned while our amphibious craft, and many Louisiana Guardsman, were both in Iraq, helpless to defend a drowning city. As GWB said ,"No one thought the levies would break!". Truly the ugliness of Bush and his fellow reactionaries is astounding. And they harp on "hating"Bush!!..Well, what were these same reactionaries doing during the Clinton years?! Just unleashing the nastiest personal hate and character assassination campaign in the nation's history!! This is their idea of a "Great Leader?" Also, I don't think angering millions around the world makes for a great leader either. Hiding behind the flag and your deity in the sky may have lots of appeal for the ever-growing lunatic fringe in the reactionary right, but , thankfully, the US citizenry is finally wising up to these lying, incompetent, ignorant, cronying war mongers, and possible war criminals! Thankfully, it is never too late! 
 Whether lounging in a field of mustard flowers, waxing drunk in an affected "traveler's accent" on the, ahem, realness of reality, or mumbling about Chartres Cathedral and the fallibility of man, "who must, in the end, die," Orson Welles slurs his way through this pathetic attempt to embody his "Grand Old Boy" superego like that drunken brother in law, tolerated, but only for your sister's sake. Every five minutes I expected apneatic snoring to interrupt his incessant, rambling narration. I can only conclude that these disturbances were removed in post-production. Too bad -- like drunk uncle Zane passing out in the middle of explaining the whole, damn 9-11 conspiracy, these somnolent interruptions would have provided a blessed intermission during which to run to the other side of the house and hope to god he sleeps it off.   
 Reviewing this book convinced me that the ultimate lesson to be derived is that you can make a bundle of cash off of the needs, hopes and fears of the credulous...and why would one WANT to "give up control" to others, or "give one's power away" to a person of dubious qualities or questionable psychic talents?  Isn't that a bit cultish and creepy?  Why not think for yourself, make your own decisions based on logic, and create your own meaning through insight and experience?  Purchase, instead, some reputable works on science, history and psychology and let your rational mind be your guide in an interesting, lovely, and real world.  Remember that the author claims to be a "psychic;" judge her track record by the hits AND the misses and draw your conclusions, free of bias.  A search at James Randi's web site is truly enlightening about Ms. Browne.. 
 I was disappointed with this book.  It was good as far as it went, but it seemed to be very choppy and didn't answer questions that I felt would be present in anyone's mind who was reading the book.  Perhaps his 2nd book gives more details about his ability to heal, how he handles this ability, what challenges he faces, etc.  Also, because almost no names or other information was given, this book had a feeling of "made up" to it.  I would like to think that isn't the case, but I wonder why someone would write a book about their gifts and yet hide their names and any information about themselves.  What is their real reason for writing it 
 What is this? His first album was great. I think this was trying to be too differnt and obscure. Like the beyond belief weird, " The omen,"( part 2 of damien) with Marilyn Manson.  Most of the music backrounds and not good and dont flow. Plus some of the rhymes dont make any sense, and are  just there for the sake of rhyming, " Ain't no way."  And as a second album it does it justice to being way more dirty and hardcore. Just the second track alone, " bring your whole crew," DMX speaks of raping a girl, killing someone  and then having sex with the corpse. I mean didnt you notice by the cover of DMX imersed in blood? I mean,  "slipping," is alright and, " It's all good," " Heat." As a whole, very un-enjoyable. I would be happy never  hearing this again. I mean inevative is great! But this mabye went too far, there weren't really any popular singles except for, " slippin'" A lot of people think DMX is a  god, and I remember DMX being a little bothered by that. A while ago the man was busted for inpersonating a police officer and pulling someone over. No to this 
 They should stop milking it with crappy film franchises like the texas chainsaw massacre. This series should have been killed off by now. The first was not even worth watching! Stay away from this whole movie series 
 I bought this book hoping to learn about basic principles of genetics in an easy-to-understand format.  What I found was that the material was written many years ago.  All you need to do is to check the copyright year.  I knew that the one glaring error was the belief that there are 200,000 genes.  We now know there are about 30,000.  But it left me wondering what other information was outdated.  Not wanting to learn incorrect information, I sent it back.  If the authors update the content, then buy it because it's an enjoyable book.  
 I'm a huge fan of pretty girls make graves. Their first two albums really rocked the joint. But I'm sorry to report that this album really doesn't add up. It just doesn't make much sense to me at all. There is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here!   instead they've gone for a really lazy, laid back style which doesn't hold yer interest. for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff, which sounds promising enough, but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and doesn't re-appear at all. They then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends!! the whole album goes like that. Songs barely get going and then promptly end.  The second guitar play has disappeared to! which means you don't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( I reckon he was the talented one). They've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who, i kid u not, puts samples of fireworks in one song!! (I've said enough)  C'mon people! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls. I heard that andrea's vocals are shot n' the doc said she had to cool it down, so I can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something.. But they are heading in the direction of Dido or goldfrapp or something bad like that.   I've listened to the album about 12 times now and can honestly say not a single one really sticks out in my mind.. What d'you guys think about it?  I hope they get their acts together and recover from this droop.  It's like Henry Rollins Said "If you aint gonna put 110% in don't even bother"  
 Well, let's see.  This is a really stupid book [...]It makes me understand why journalists are generally considered to be scum.  For example, the author ridicules Mary Ann Glendon, a perfectly respectable Harvard law professor, celebrated author, and conservative Catholic, while giving a free pass to "Catholics for a Free Choice," a group whose name is a contradiction in terms, kinda like if there were a group called "Cannibals Against the Consumption of Human Flesh."  You know what really irks me about this book?  The author's supposed objectivity and fairness.  Yes, he quotes both conservative Catholics and liberal Catholics, but not in any kind of even-handed way.  As in the above case, conservative Catholics are always put in a negative light, whereas liberal Catholics (with a few key exceptions, when they are so far out that only a Matthew Fox or Margaret Starbird would affirm their position) are always put in a positive light.    Not only that, this book is sensationalist and pandering: sensationalist in the way it presents information, and pandering in the way it plays to fellow journalists and the media in general.  After reading it, it made me realize how incredibly idiotic most journalists are, how craven, sold-out, and just plain dumb they are.  Proof?  Take the title of this book.  Is it an unintentional bad pun?  Who knows?  And isn't it just a little bit arrogant to think you can prognosticate about what's gonna happen with Catholicism in the next few years?  Hey, but so what?  Divining the future sells books, doesn't it?  So let's go with it, especially with the mildly prurient title.  In any case, [...] this should make the Garry Willses and David Traceys--as well as the rest of the puny but strangely influential (at least among themselves) ranks of disaffected, alienated Catholics--happy.  For a fair, balanced, nuanced look at the recent "Catholic troubles," see George Weigel's fine book, The Courage to Be Catholic (which the author, surprise! Surprise! dismisses).  
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 I purchased the cheese slicer to replace one from the 70's that finally gave out.  I pulled out a block of cheddar cheese and tried the new slicer.  The comfortable handle made holding the slicer a dream, but the dream ended quickly.  The wire broke halfway through the first slice!  Unlike my old slicer, this one does not have a screw on the side to re-attach the existing wire, adjust the tension or replace a broken wire.   Oxo's web site says they guarantee satisfaction, so I am going to see if I can actually get it replaced without paying more in shipping than I saved by buying this slicer rather than the fancier one 
 I bought this, and when I put the batts. in, It got so hot!  I switched them to Duracells, and that was better, but then it died all together. This is my second laser and I think I learned somthing: To get a good quality laser it's got to be an expensive green.(Or super powered blues!!)  ~~By the way this is really 0 stars, but it's not an option.~ 
 Perhaps someone should tie this in with The Rule of Four?! After reading that I determined that reading the real book from the 15th century would not be up my alley. I do highly recommend The Rule of Four...it was a good read. If only someone would give a phonetic pronunciation of this Hypner....whatever. It's the premise for a best-seller & I've no idea how to pronounce it 
 Held my attention for an airplane ride (hence 2 stars), but I was sincerely disappointed for the last third.  Kept reading because I didn't think any author would be that brazen.  Trivializes current political / social / religous arguments to an insulting degree 
 This book is in three parts.  In the first part tells we meet Miyax on the Arctic tundra after running away from her marriage.  We find that she is only thirteen years old, and is going to meet a friend in San Francisco.  Miyax has run out of provisions for her trip, and realizes that she is lost.  She decides to join a wolf pack to survive, so she studies their behavior and imitates it.  She is accepted, and is able to care for herself.  She also recognizes birds and, knowing their migration habits, is able to discern her location and direction.    The second part tells Miyax's life before part one.  It tells of her father, Kapugen, and how he sent her to live with his aunt Martha and go to school, where she is called Julie.  One day Aunt Martha told Miyax that her father had never returned from a hunting trip, and pieces of his kayak were found on the shore.  Kapugen had arranged a marriage between Miyax and the son of one of his old friends.  When she met Daniel, she was disappointed to realize that he was mentally slow.  After she was married, she basically became a helper to Daniel's mother in her business of making parkas to sell to tourists.  One day Daniel came home angry because others were taunting him with "having a wife and not knowing how to mate her."  Miyax ran away in fear that night.    Part three goes back to being lost on the tundra.  Miyax grows to love her wolf pack, and looks to the leader as her father.  When she sees him killed for sport, she decides not to head to San Francisco where people do not recognize the value of the old Eskimo ways.  She chooses to live alone in the wild, until she meets some people who tell her that her father is not dead.  She goes to find him, but thinks that he has forsaken the Eskimo ways, and is part of the kind of people that would kill her wolf father for sport.  In the end of the book, she sees that maybe the time of the Eskimos is past, and returns to her father.    I didn't care for this book too much, probably because it reminded me of Scott O'Dell's "The Island of the Blue Dolphins."  Then I realized that the same author wrote "My Side of the Mountain" which is the same kind of survival story.  It didn't seem to have all that much of a plot, and I didn't care for the part about Miyax's marriage, or the way she identified with the wolves.  I think it's because we as people are social creatures, designed to live with each other, not alone in isolation from other people.  We desire to have companions, and although dogs or other animals may be man's best friend, and solitude is necessary at times, it is hard for me to connect with a book like this.   
 I bought this to help me teach Spanish to my grandchildren and I was quite disappointed.  It is mostly arts & crafts and VERY little Spanish.  And when it says "Basic Spanish," it really means basic 
 Received the tri-pod yesterday, purchased based on positive reviews on Amazon, very disappointed. The tri-pod is 80% plastic. All the controls are plastic, how long will this last is debatable. The weight should have been a clue. Lesson learned see it in person first. Would not buy again. 
 Don't let the cover fool you, this film isn't half as fun as you may hope it is. Maybe it's my own fault, but I was expecting something more like "Groove", or at least something interesting to watch. And it's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands, I often listen to Joy Division/New Order/Happy Mondays, and more from that scene. However, this seemed much more like the story of Tony Wilson and The Factory, than it did about the music, and almost came-off as a documentary. I almost stopped watching it out of boredom, but saw it through anyway. Now I wouldn't call this bad, it had it's good parts, just not many. 
 This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 
 I couldn't even finish it. Not a single character was likable. If you want to read a good book, read Annie On My Mind 
 I had seen other reviews for this book, raving about it.  To me, it indicates that there is a dearth in the art curriculum arena.  I need to quit my day job and start writing.  The book is colorful and has some merit, but is really nothing more than someone's collection of pictures for children to copy.  Somewhere, somehow, I would love to find an art curriculum for children that is deeper than a creek bed but also practical.  
 yeah, ok, Ice Cube is a bounty hunter and Mike Epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys,am I right on that...right. the story is great but not that great. so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky, thats what it was like for me folks. god I almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax. put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this. for Cube and Epps and Eva Mendes fans only. and if you wanna see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it, then this is the film for you 
 I like the Keep Chickens! book better. This book has a chapter of killing chickens with some disturbing photos in it. If you love your chickens like your dogs, you'll end up taping that section which is what I did 
 I was very disappointed with the ending of this new Danielle Steel.  It seemed like a very long read, with a very quick ending.  I have read every one of her books, and have never been so disappointed with a story until now.  I would not recommend this to anyone 
 What in the world happened with this clunker?  You have a script from Oscar winning writer John Patrick Shanley (Moonstruck); a cast any director would die for; and an initially interesting premise.  But even with all that, THE JANUARY MAN is not a good movie.  Shanley's script is so disjointed and the only attempt at comedy seems to be Kline's physical confrontation with the killer.  It takes the movie at least thirty minutes to focus on the killings, and even then, it plods along.  Shanley may have tried to hard to force the genres to work, and it shows.  And director Pat O'Connor should be required to do community service for his mishandling of this talented cast.  Kevin Kline, usually a strong presence in any film, plays Nick Starkey like it was an After School special--bland, unfocused and murky.  Susan Sarandon, who has won an Oscar, tries to be a kind of Julia Roberts femme fatale, but she's about as seductive as a seahorse.  Rod Steiger and Danny Aiello overact so badly, it's hard to believe these gentlemen have given us such good work in the past.  Harvey Keitel needs to play villains if this is how he chooses to embody a "good guy" for a change.  Alan Rickman's Ed is stereotypical artiste, but he at least adds some needed color to the movie.  And Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio is pathetically dull and lethargic. THE JANUARY MAN could have been a good thriller, but under O'Connor's awful direction and Shanley's poorly developed script, it merely becomes one of those classic examples of a good movie gone bad 
 I thought this DVD would be fun. It's got a fantastic feature that allows you to customize your workout, but I was really disappointed with the content. It was poorly organized, short, and not very fun. I bought it the day it was released and am already getting rid of it. Don't waste your money. If you want a great workout that's fun, get Carmen Electra's striptease workout. The best are 1 and 2. 
 If an author sets out to write a collection of short stories about adultery, you'd think they'd have a lo say about it, right? Well, Ford certainly expends plenty of words, but the net impact of them is next to nothing by the end of this incredibly feeble navel-gazing group of stories. Mind-numbingly similar in tone and temperament, the ten stories center of upper and upper-middle class white, middle-aged, married professionals who seem to have drifted into infidelity. Story after story plods cautiously along, poking at the consequences of adultery in a very mild way, with leaden dialogue and a lot of empty moodiness. Adultery is treated almost as a kind of bland rite-of-passage for a disconnected male. Marital infidelity can happen in so many ways for so many reasons, and yet Ford seems interested in only a very limited field of it. I have no idea what his personal background or situation is, but it's a collection you read and leave wishing the author had worked out their issues in therapy or something. If he wasn't such a literary bigshot, there's no way this would have been published-it strikes the same note over and over and over, and isn't provocative, insightful, or even interesting. PS. If you were planning on the audio version, don't. Ford is a terrible reader, sounding like someone reading the telephone book aloud as punishment 
 Having seen the movie and read the screenplay, I can never fail to understand how something like this was ever taken seriously.  There is absolutely nothing original here; the writing is shallow, tedious and unbelievably hackneyed and I marvel that such mediocre talent could be so hyped, so gushed over and can only wonder how such 'writing' could ever have been made into a movie let alone win an Academy Award! It baffles me completely.  Perhaps the powers-that-be in Hollywood owed something to Robin Williams.....  Incidentally, there is much whispering in industry circles that Affleck and Damon didn't really even write this screenplay.  Instead it was the result of a collaboration between Gus Van Zant, Robin Williams and Rob Reiner.  As a matter of fact much of William's comedic dialogue was improvised by the master himself, yet authorship was, strangely, still credited to Affleck and Damon - probably for shrewd publicity and marketing reasons.  The fact that these two have not produced any screenplays worthwhile since tends to verify suspicions about their real and minimal contributions to Good Will Hunting 
 If you are in search of an autobiography of a dedicated and intrinsically emotional scientist, then this is the book for you.  However, if truly interested in the actual neuroscience this book claims to teach, search for a more nonfictional and scientific work.  Pithy factual information of such molecules of emotion is obstructed with unnecessary personal dramatics and stories loosely tied to the intended subject matter.  While the book provides insight to the life of a cutting-edge scientist, the autobiographical nature obscures the supposed purport of the book: to teach the neuroscience of emotions.  
 This book is about a ung boy named bud and is liveing with a bad family that is mean to him after a while and they lock in a shed one night and he desides to run away.When he runs away he sleeps under a tree in front of a libary that serves beakfeast and so on.Then after a couple nights he leaves the tree and trys to find his father.after hours of walking a man picks him up and helps him try and find his father 
  The first few pages grab my attention however the story involved far too much historical information and description. This writer loses his reader by not bringing the hero back into the story almost at the end of the book after a long absence. The hero was the main reason I bought the book in the first place, he didn't reappear for almost three hundred pages later. 
 This article is a reprint of a 1913 magazine piece written by Joshua L. Chamberlain to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Gettysburg.  While it's interesting to read his first hand depiction of the battle, all readers should note the story is approximately 15 pages long.  The publishers have tried to beef up the "book" by adding 15 additional pages of photos, but it does not make up for the lack of content.  I was very disappointed with the purchase 
 It's difficult to take anything Mr. Roberst writes seriously as he is on all sides of almost every issure depending on his audience.  He likes to be "confrontational" which, for him, amounts to attacking politicians and groups from the left for doing one thing and those on the right for doing what he told the left they should do.  I guess he believes that makes him "balanced" but it's a lie, he's simply someone who likes to stir the pot regardless whether he actually believes or doesn't believe in the postion he's taking.  And that's the trouble, he really doesn't have any beliefs.  Good reading if you like sociopathic writers 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 Simply put, this was an awful disappointment. James Michener is one of my favorite authors, but I remember when he came to Kent to do the research for this book, and he evidently didn't do any himself, because the inaccuracies in this book outnumber the truths. It's so poorly put together that I stopped reading any of his books for several years after this one came out. Do not -- I repeat, do NOT -- base your perceptions of what happened in Kent on the material presented in this book. There have been so many other books written since then that are more accurate -- pick any of them. Better yet, read several. Everybody seems to have a different idea of what really happened anyway. As a member of the KSU class of 1970, I had several friends who were there that day, and some of them couldn't talk about it for 25 years. This is not a subject to be dismissed so lightly with so little regard for the truth. My feeling is that this was a true American tragedy that didn't need to happen, and only did happen because of political power, arrogance, and greed 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 To save yourself from taking the time to read the book, I'll sum it up.  Pesticides= Bad.  Buy local, eat organic=Good.  The part about setting up a kitchen for those who don't cook was almost humorous.  It was written by someone who doesn't cook much.  It then prepared you to expect the rest of the book to have simple meals that new cooks could do.  That wasn't the case.  The recipes look good. I haven't tried any yet, but I was hoping to learn something more not buy a cookbook.  I decided the only thing "urban" about the kitchen was access to the unusual ingredients that many of the recipes had 
 Boy I had high hopes for this one. Coming off their best album, Shot, and produced by Gang of Four's Andy Gill, I was expecting a masterpiece. The opening track isn't half bad, but the rest is throw-away. Doesn't even  sound like Jesus Lizard. Go get Down or Shot instead 
 This novel by G.K. Chesterton, starts very well, with a policeman so succesful in trying to infiltrate a group of anarchists that he is elected one of the bosses of the cell. Then things slowly becomes more muddled and the plot collapses halfway through the book, as it becomes more and more confusing and improbable and the author tries to feed on us too much indigestible philosophical baggage (Chesterton was a notorious political ultraconservative who seemed to find nothing worthwhile in the Europe after the Middle Ages). If you want to read a novel about early 20th century anarchists, I suggest instead you read Joseph Conrad's "The Secret Agent" 
 these are not 100% plastic but they are paper please do not buy these if you think you are getting plastic cards. 
 We bought this unit for a 5-day trip, the picture is very clear, better than most but right after that trip the second monitor lost its picture.  We sent it back to the manufacturer, never received the item back and it's been about 2 months. Stay away from this product! 
 I bought this expecting some informative reading.  I finished it, not having fulfilled my hopes.  The author spends his time discussing philosophy & religion, insulting scientists & mathematicians, and saying how much greater Buddha was than Aristotle.    Let's try a thought experiment:  Suppose you have a fireplace, and 1 log was left partially sticking out of the fire last night, such that the flames missed it.  Would you say that the log was burned (A) or unburned (not A)?  According to Mr. Kosko, science & math would pick one or the other.  That's bunk, we'd say the log was 40% burned and 60% unburned (A & not A).  We'd use percentages.  The author would argue that on a 0<->1 fuzzy continuum, from burned to unburned, the log would fall on a point 0.4 fuzzy units from the unburned point and 0.6 fuzzy units from the burned point.  Any monkey can see that he's taken the same thing all scientists do and changed around the words.  Oh, and for all the computer programmers out there (of which I'm one), the author seems to think that binary computer programming is incapable of utilizing multiple partial conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSEIF-THEN-ELSE-THEN-ENDIF).  This programming construct was not invented by fuzzy science, but has been around for a very long time.  Part of the section about how fuzzy-logic controlled machines was interesting and informative.  Once again, multiple partial condition control statements are no invention of fuzzy science 
     There was no problem with the turntable, except the sound was very poor, distorted and muddy. I thought it had to be the cartridge, and so stated in my reply to you.  I thought perhaps you would provide me with a new cartridge, instead I was offered a 15% discount. I could not tolerate the sound, so that was not acceptable. I have quite a collection of records 33 and 45's. Some of them are in fair condition but the reproductio was very poor.   I have ordered several items on the net and that was the first return. so I don't think it was my problem.    Thank you,    Robert Sander 
 While the story line was tolerable and interesting at times, the preachiness of 'educating the reader' about the favorite 'special interest' of the author really comes across to clumsily that it detracts from the overall flow of the book (every few pages there seems to be a jab here and there thrown in to meet some sort of a PSA quota.)  The story line is not as good as Toxin, but this title is slightly less offensive in the constant regurgitation of the 'healthcare system= evil' message than it is in Toxin 
 my purchase arrived in good time. case was in good condition. said it was new but the cds didnt play good. some episodes would skip and not play at all, not very happy with item. 
 I read exactly half the book and stopped.  Based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending, that was a good decision.  As it is there went hours of my life I won't get back!  The book is silly and laughable.  The premise sounded great - but the book is bad.  Really bad 
 This will probably be the last volume in this series I will buy. There are two or three decent episodes here, but already you can see the emergence of the "What got aboard this time?" cut-rate storytelling that eventually doomed "Voyage." In many cases the writing is so hackneyed that character motivations are simply ignored, leaving some show conclusions way up in the air.  Of course, the special effects are still marvelous, even though the same underwater shots are frequently reused. Basehart and Hedison do their best, but by late in the second season the cast had been cut back and Irwin Allen was really playing his big audience for suckers. Of course, he pretty much made a career of that. Even so, I guess I'm still a sucker for "Voyage," which I have loved since the sixties 
 i'v seen a multitude of documentaries, both low and high budget, and although i found the story interesting i felt this film was not up the hype it was given.  worth seeing, but not worth owning 
 As great as it looks, I can't get past the incomplete directions (only printed outside of the box; no directions inside) to get it installed on the wall:  it says "pull out the plastic end cap"...haven't a clue what the plastic end cap is, nor how to pull it out nor how to install the screws that hold it on the box.  may have to return 
 This book sets out to tell that it was Jackie Kennedy's mother that instilled strength in her daughter. What she acctually did was instill a self-hatred. There is a great book called "Mrs. Kennedy: The Missing History of the Kennedy Years" by Barbara Leaming. In that book the author states repeatedly that her mother treated her older daughter horribly. Onassis's mother would tell her daughter that her hair was too kinky and she had big feet her eyes were too big, her hands were too big and that no man would marry her because she was so unattractive in every way. Her mother may have been saying these things to make sure her daughter would act wisely so she could land a man, but it is obvious that these taunts had a neg. effect on her daughter. Onassis thought that her marriage to JKF was a faliure because she believed his cheating was the result of all the neg. things she thought she was, all those neg. things her mother said she was. Jackie thought that she had to stick out the marrage because she was lucky to have found a man that could look past her "ugly" looks. Hopefully the readers of this book will not be suckered into believing that this woman, Janet A. was a great woman. She was cruel to many people. The only good thing I can say about the subject is that she is a prime example of how far woman have come in this society. From being raised as Janet A. was to "land a man" to finding fullfilment within and not through wealth and marraige 
 The opening of 'The Laughing Jesus' is brilliant. Freke and Gandy manage to make a compelling case for an examination of the historical basis for a literal interpretation of scripture. They highlight recent events of 9/11 but also talk about the crusades and the role literal interpretation of religion has played throughout the ages. After this, however, things go pear shaped.  The authors declare boldly that what is needed in this current age and what they are going to do about the current crisis in the world:  "Our response is to mount a full-scale assault on the pernicious idea that God writes books."  And so the task begins. This is the 3rd Freke and Gandy book i am reading and its clear that they know what their 'trump card' is; it's their attack on the historical existence of Jesus. This is where they have been most successful and this is material highlighted by numerous other scholars. Thus we get chapter that examines this, regurgitating the material of 'The Jesus Mysteries', entitled 'The Most Famous Man Who Never Lived'. This is their forte and they deliver their arguments in much the same style as in their previous books.  Either side of this chapter, however, are two chapters that sadly do not live up to the same standards as the other. I am aware that they are mounting their 'full scale assault' but this should not mean that their style of writing should suddenly become tabloid in nature. The quality drops dramatically. Provocative, and at times filthy language is used to insight reactions from those reading the text. The arguments given are very flimsy and easily countered in nearly all cases. Following this full on assault of Judaism and Islam we then enter in to the section of the book detailing Gnostism as they way forward.  Sadly Freke and Gandy have just over simplified things and selectively quoted just a bit too often for their thesis to hold any water at all. Only someone with a very poor understanding of the history of Judiasm, Christianity and Islam will be able to read the material and not question most statements.  They have just tried to do much. For instance in the space of just 5 pages they try to demonstrate that Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David, and Solomon never existed. These figures stretch over a period of 1000 years, yet in 5 pages Freke and Gandy aim to show they never existed, and nor did any of the things they were supposed to have done. This section is woeful.  Their attack on Islam in Chapter 5 is equally over ambitious and naive. Here they concede Muhammad existed, and even admit that he brought positive rules and laws, for example stating:  "Women were amongst Muhammad's closest followers, they took part in public life, and even fought alongside men in battle. Muhammad forbade the killing of girl children, or regretting that they were not boys, and gave women legal rights of divorce and inheritance centuries before the West."  Unfortunately after acknowledging this they state that all this was due to Muhammad being influence by Gnostics.   "Muhammad originally followed the Gnostics' egalitarian example in his treatment of women".  Thus, according to them, any positive elements found in any religion are only there due to the fact that the really true parts are Gnosticism. This is the claim of Freke and Gandy. They are not subtle about this either stating in the opening of the book:  "Religion isn't all bad. It has answered the profound human yearning to understand the mysteries of life and death. It has inspired people of all cultrures and temples, transcendental music and songs. It has the power because at its heart is Gnostic spirituality"  I was very disappointed by the book in general. Having enjoyed their other books, this was a huge disappointment and perhaps showed me that these authors are not as knowledgeable as I may have thought from their other writings.  In conclusion I would say this book is actually quite dangerous. Its inflammatory, factually inaccurate in many places, heavily polemic towards a Gnostic view of the world and often crude and vulgar.  For anyone wanting a detailed, balanced and yet deeply comprehensive analysis of fundamentalism and trends in Judaism, Christianity and Islam I would recommend 'The Battle for God' by Karen Armstrong 
 While I jumped into the character sporadically (I think this is the second one I read with him as the main character) it flowed fast and his smart remarks I always find humorous.  While the plot is quite weak and I actually guessed part of it, it was a fun read.  It went quick and should have built more into the red herring that the cover leads you to believe.  Even the school principal lacked some Ooommmph if you know what I mean.  The grandmother was a good role, but the parents coud have been much more important.  So overall, let's call it a quick read, funny and enjoyable, but not one of his best.  I picked it up at the airport and read it on the very same trip.  Not one I would keep, so back it went with the 50% return offer the airport here has 
 Mr. Winn can bash Islam all he wants. The truth of the matter is if someone is really seeking god and truly wants to work ship him alone, he will not see a better way then Islam. Islam was sent for not just those Arabs, Islam is sent for all of mankind. Its funny how Winn talks about Islam wants money, sex, and power. In reality, Prophet Muhammad (May peace be upon him) use to tell the people, live this life as you were a traveler. He (S.A.W) used to convey the people to travel light so that it will be easier for you on the day of Judgment. He (S.A.W) didn't know how to read or write, so the Quran has to come from Jibreel to Muhammad (S.A.W). The prayer was one of the things God actually told Muhammad directly face to face. God has prescribed 5 daily prayers on the followers of Muhammad (s.a.w). Read the actual Quran and find more info. Go to the following websites. May Allah guide you to the truth.  http://www.islam-guide.com/ http://www.islamtomorrow.com/ 
 i would review it if i got it. come on guys. i placed the order on 1/6/06. 
 While I enjoy Greenberg's radio show, I was extremely disappointed in this book.  Throughout the book, Greenberg relays the same banal stories he repeats ad nauseum on the radio.  Unfortunately, unlike on the radio, when Mike Golic is always available to slap some sense into Greenberg, this book is purely 100% Greenberg.  I am always amazed by those people who have lived extremely privileged lives, yet try to act like they have "struggled" in life.  Greenberg has had to "struggle" thru a cushy upbringing, going to exclusive schools such as Northwestern and eventually landing his gig at ESPN.  For those of you in the Chicago area, I hope that you caught Debra Pickett's article on Greenberg in the Chicago Sun-Times.  While Greenberg professes to be a family man, the article notes how he spent 2-1/2 hours talking about his favorite topic, himself, while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool.  Keeping with his privileged existence, the pool was located at the East Bank Club in Chicago, yet another privileged club to which Greenberg belongs.  I should receive a refund for slopping thru this "book."  Hopefully, this review will prevent other people from making the mistake I did.  ESPN should fire this wimpy "meterosexual" for writing this book.  
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
 I've spent the last 20+ years in the military and I really enjoy reading about our military heroes.  But, it bothers me when someone uses the military to espouse their political ideology.  I don't know anything about Allen Mikaelian, but I'd guess he was very unhappy with the presidential election in 2000 and felt he needed to do something.  The author selectively picks recipients that provide a positive image of the left wing and a negative image of the right wing.  There is nothing wrong with highlighting minority or women recipients.  I think that is great and much needed, but the author should have been up front with the title and foreword and should have left out the political propaganda.  Instead he covertly gives the impression that these 11 individuals represent your typical CMH recipient, both historically and politically.  This book definitely has some value, but unless your polical views are a little far to the left, you may get a bit irritated at the political rhetoric.  
 I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with "Kagemusha" and "Ran", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about "historical" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no "ugly" shot in either "Ran" or "Kag" - merely that there are more "authentically Japanese" films out there to choose from.   
 There is only ONE page of useful info in the entire book. I am not kidding! ONE page. Everything else is fluff to sell a book. I thought it might be fun to read in bed w/ my girlfriend...negative.  the one page has a fairly accurate diagram of the vagina w/ some arrows that say "rub here."  Everything else was crap.  And a waste of time. I guess if you are a terrible lover who doesn't try and please your woman - it could be marginally useful but not in comparison to most texts out there. If you know it's important to get your girl turned on before going to work than all you need out of this book is that one page. Look it up on the net and save your money 
 Paul Johnson's History of the Jews seems to start well: to a layman, at least, there is a sense of balance - but then it is hard to take the uprising against Zedekiah personally, and while of course it could, under duress, be made to read as a trope for various political tendencies, the author wisely shows little interest in giving the incident a partisan colour. Modern history, however, gets a far different treatment.   The Ashkenazim were often characterized by anti-Semites as "cunning"; recent scholarship shows that, in fact, the isolation and other unusual conditions to which they were subject over generations inclined them not only towards certain diseases (almost 60% of Ashkenazi suffer from genetically-linked alleles) but also towards higher intelligence than other European males: almost 15 IQ points above the average verbal and mathematical scores, although they tend to have visuospacial scores slightly below the average (see "Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence", Journal of Biosocial Science, June 2005). Little wonder, then, that Jews were enthusiastic participants in the explosion of new ideas that followed the Enlightenment.   These Jews, from Spinoza on, are given increasingly heavy-handed treatment. While it is normal for an author to have his personal preference - in Johnson's case, for the religious over the secular, the moderate over the radical, and the conservative over the progressive - Johnson's Jew is the product of a dangerously nostalgic mis-remembering. Can it be anything other than deeply and insultingly patronizing for a Gentile author to engage, albeit from some supposedly philo-Semitic motive, in the taxonomy of Jews into self-hating and non-? It is a meaningless exercise at best; would anyone ever think to call Luther a self-hating Catholic? Or Galileo?   At worst, it belies the very philo-Semitism it supposedly characterizes. Why is Rosa Luxembourg a self-hating Jew? Because her politics don't match Johnson's own? Or, more disturbingly, because she doesn't match his image of the meek and dutiful Jew, happily occupied with his scrolls and his flat bread? This stereotypical Jew is sometimes known, in my (admittedly assimilated) circles, as the Williamsburg Jew because, although people imagine they will find him in Brooklyn, in fact he is unlikely to exist outside the implications of the Virginia tourist attraction of the same name.   Luxembourg's statement, on which Johnson hangs the self-hating epithet, that she is only as concerned about the troubles of Jews as she is about the troubles of all oppressed peoples, is obviously Communist in its inspiration - and therefore anathema to the author - but it is nonetheless completely rational and, it should be pointed out, not incompatible with the Jewish mission to serve as an example. Why is a rational Jew self-hating - because he might make trouble for the Goyim? There is something of the minstrel show about Johnson's model of the modern Jew, something that undermines irretrievably the book as a whole 
 All the promos made me think that this would be a really great Sci-Fi story with beautiful babes all over the place.  Well, there WERE some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies, never materialized.  Has the art of "posing" been lost by modern girls?  Maybe all the good directors have retired or died!  What a pity...Why, I couldn't even muster a stiff upper lip as I played this DVD through to the end.   In spite of my being a certifiable "dirty old man". [:-)     
 This is a pep rally on CD; an unsingable, emotionally charged pep rally.  It really upsets me that this is the face of today's Christian music.  The melodies are not easily singable at all, and the songs use all the same musical cliches.  This is worship manipulation at it's best.  If you read the words to learn something concrete about God, you will find nothing of substance.  They talk about actions to give God and our response to God, but no meat-and-potatoes of WHY we should be doing this.  God IS great, but WHY?  This is VERY disturbing, and completely unacceptable for congregational worship.  
 Two-star rating for the live footage alone.  Waaaaay too many douchebags are interviewed.  Idiots/burnouts like Bruce Loose, Springa, Vinnie Stigma and Jimmy Gestapo make me embarrassed to be a fan of independent music in general.  Jack Grisham is the biggest offender ("huh-huh, I'm cool and edgy because I pissed on a passed-out girl").  That's not a fault of the film though, as these people were idiots back then too, so it is historically accurate.  I can't believe the short-shrift that the midwest got--some of the best bands came from that region.  Oh well.  Rent it for the footage.  Oh, and HR looks really old.  
 It is very repetative and over simplified. He does make his point, then again, then again. While his one point was interesting, it's not worth the book. I read this book a few years back. Now that I have been more involved in the market, I can say that the book has contributed nothing to my experience. 
 I've been a big fan of Delerium, Conjure One and even Front Line Assembly.  I have to confess that I think Karma was one of the best offerings they put forward just because the number of tracks I liked was high.  When Poem came out there were still a number of tracks on that CD that I liked.  And when Chimera came out there were less tracks on the CD that I liked but I still thought the CD was a worthwhile purchase.    With Nuages du Monde I think that I should've listened to the tracks on-line and downloaded what I wanted.  There were one or two songs that I liked on this CD.  However, even as background music and therefore unlike previous Delerium CD's, this CD didn't have that 'feel' to it.  Instead it felt artificial and unlike what they've done in the past.  I do truly like the 1 or 2 tracks I've heard on their latest but a part of me thinks that it wasn't worth the price of a full CD.  I don't regret getting this CD but I will be reluctant to buy a full CD from them in the future 
 . . .or, at least, mis-subtitled.  If Conason wants to write a book worthy of the title, it should be _Big Lies:  Every Word I've Ever Said on Television, Every Book, Essay, and Column I've Ever Written_ 
 I am an enrolled Northern Arapaho. The first problem I have is the title. Since when did "Indian Giver" have a positive connotation? Secondly, I find it difficult to validate Mr. Weatherford's "research" since Mt. St. Helens erupted in 1980, NOT 1983. Finally, to me anyway, the book is complete with "facts", unfounded assumptions, and "back-handed" compliments. If the book was intended to "inform" the dominant society of the contributions of Indian people, both from North and South America, then it succeeds. It tells them exactly what they want to hear. It however only irritates the Native populations by providing even more false information to an already poorly informed general public. Ha hou'(Thank you. 
 I read this book several years ago.  Just recently, I read Anthony Robbin's Unlimited Power.  If you're choosing between Awaken the Giant Within and Unlimited Power, definitely go with Unlimited Power.  Don't bother with this book.   
 Do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish.  There is factual information here, but it is buried in gushy self-absorption.  I bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause, but I'd be embarrassed to lend it out 
 Just not my cup of tea.  Well written but as I said not my cup of tea..I will not purchase the others in the series 
 When I try to watch this, I have to turn the sound on my TV all the way up to hear it and even then it's still too low. Some parts are better than others, but I was not pleased with the sound recording quality 
 Bought this CD based upon the reviews and the fact that they were recommended with some other albums I like, and man, what a mistake. This CD borders on unlistenable, with no discernable melody/talent to be found. I'm hardly some ignorant pop-music lover...I consider "Blueberry Boat" to be one of my favorite records - but this is just horrible 
 I bought 4 other head first series books, java, EJB, Design pattern, and Servlet. These books were fast, funny and of course, informative. I really love these series. However, when I read this book I was so disappointed. Most explanations are redundant and it made me boring and the reading pace was suspended. I think the author have to add more examples and shorten the explanation. I regret to buy this book. Not recommended. 
 Slayer goes punk?  I've only got one thing to say about that: SELLOUTS!!!  Slayer, you guys better go back to metal, or else you'll lose millions of fans all over the world, just like Metallica did when they sold out!  Slayer should stick to what they do best: in your face thrash metal!  A brutal band like you has no business playing that punk sh.it!  What were you guys thinking?  Slayer goes punk?  Whats next, Slayer covers Green Day's Greatest Hits?  This is by far the worst album ever released by a metal band!  Even worse than Metallica's Black Album in 1991 
 I have read the other reviews with great interest.   N. J. Dawood's translation of the Qur'an is as close to being worthless as it is possible for an English translation of the Qur'an to be. The errors and mistranslations are such that many consider it to be perilously close to blasphemous. At best, it is absolutely impossible to get a clear understanding of what the Qur'an is really saying from Dawood's attempt to render the Qur'an into modern English.  He changed the traditional Sura order to the chronological Sura order (i.e. the Suras in the authentic Quran are not arranged in the order in which they were revealed). This indicative of his excessive license with the work, as well as his clear contempt for the original. An Iraqi Jew, Dawood excercises considerable self-aggrandizment with his claims that Jewish and Christian teachings influenced the Prophet. These and other liberties demontrate his unwillingness and incapacity to produce an accurate and unbiased translation.  His mistakes of translation are beyond ridiculous: e.g. 'bani Adam" (correct translatied as 'children of Adam'; from al-Araf 7:31) is rendered as "children of Allah". In Al-Baqarah 2:191 'al fitnatu asyaddu minal qatl ("oppression is worse than slaughter")' is mistranslated as 'idolatry is worse than carnage". Space does not permit me to list the dozens and dozens of other errors which would be amusing if applied to any other book.  As a Muslim, my disgust for his translation is so adamate that I refuse to permit a copy of it in my home.  Because if this, I have absolutely no animosity or ill feelings towards any of those who posted vitrolic invective about the Qur'an: simply because they never read the Qur'an. They read N. J. Dawood's worthless poetry; which, of course, cannot provide them with a shred of useful information with which to make an informed choice in the matter. I will not hold people's ignorance against them.  With all the sincerity at my command, I advise all, Muslim and non-Muslim alike to shun Dawood's translation as you need not mere diseased swine 
 Waste of money! If this DVD would have cost one dollar it would have been too much money. I wish I would have read the reviews before buying it, I would have saved myself from getting the worst Richard Pryor DVD ever made! I don't care to type anymore about it because once I really get started I won't shut up and this DVD is not worth my time. I didn't want to even give it one star but in order to do this review it showed I had to give at least one star. I think if it doesn't deserve a star it shouldn't get one 
 This is one of the most horribly muddled "thrillers" I've ever read.  By the end, I wasn't sure who was "winning" or "losing," nor did I really care.  Clive better quit sub-contracting out his writing.  He should dump this cast of characters and concentrate on Dirk Pitt.  
 "The Beast in the Jungle" is the most effective sleeping pill you are likely to find anywhere. I challenge any reader to go through this text in one sitting and not falling asleep or, at least, not to experiment a tremendous mind-numbing feeling. Of course, I haven't read all the books in the world, but I dare say that this is the most boring piece of writing ever conceived by anyone. I find it very hard to imagine something more awful than this. It's absolutely impossible, unsurpassable.  Henry James' style is so artificially conceited and pompous that you have to ask yourself if the trash he used to write wasn't a very calculated joke after all or if he's just trying to take the reader for a ride (a ride into a world of dullness and boredom, that is). The supposedly "psychological insight" of James is just a mere exercise in nothingness, the highest form of pretentiousness in its purest expression.   In this short???-story (James wasn't very strong on things like "precision" and "conciseness"), the terrible fate that seems to be in store for the main character after pages and pages of monotonous text, turns out to be that "nothing is to happen to him". Pathetic and childish. In my opinion, "The Beast in the Jungle" is the greatest proof that James was a dreadful writer (not to say "an insipid donkey").  Actually, James is so comical as to excite parody. In the old days H.G. Wells likened his prose to an hippopotamus pushing a pea and Ambrose Bierce said that James' work would benefit if someone took the pain to translate it into English. I personally agree with the two of them but, you know, many things that in the past have been judged as "ridiculous" or "stupid" are considered today, through some arbitrary process known as "reassessment of literary figures", as something pretty relevant and sophisticated. That's life, isn't it?.  "The Beast in the Jungle" is a poor story that serves James as an excuse for writing a lot and not to say anything significant. Completely worthless. In case I had to choose, I'd prefer to read a telephone directory instead.  Of course, this prime example of literary incompetence is regarded as a masterpiece by many scholars.  Well, each to his own.. 
 The book is about a spoiled unsatisfiable teenage girl whom keeps marrying men and then running away from her problems because she doesn't like her situation. I was forced to reed this book in school and i had no sympathy for the main character Janie. She needs to realize that the world is not perfect. The only part of the book that i actually cared for was at the begining of the book when she is gossiped about upon walking back to town and she ignores the gossip and holds her head high 
 Is it just me or is American Pie becoming another National Lampoon type thing where they just create a bunch of weak, strait to DVD movies that are trying to sale based on the American Pie franchize name? About as lame as the Dukes of Hazzard sequal, Dumb & Dumberer, and the numerous Disney movies comin' out with strait to DVD release sequals to movies made like 50 years ago 
 Arrived damaged and seller would not back the product.  Amazon stood behind the sale and refunded payment.  Beware of certain sellers 
 I realize that this is supposed to be an introductory book, however it does not provide enough detail to be very useful in my 2nd year inorganic chem class. I am extremely disappointed by this since the book costs so much money. I wonder how much more it would cost if it was hardcover.   It does have a good layout and bright pictures and colors though. I guess this is supposed to stimulate the brain or something 
 "The number" poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers. A four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom, even if it is a number. Eisenberg's number is the inverse of that draw down, or twenty-five times.... well, there's the rub, twenty-five times what? income? expenses? income less savings? projected discretionary spending? Post-mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses? The proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants, experts, philosophers, and casual acquaintances. Eisenberg, a former Esquire editor and short-timer with Lands End, ruminates about a simple question: How much money do you need to feel secure? The problem is that security comes in multiple forms: happiness, comfort, excess consumption, ego. And the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be. Constructing a one-year budget is hard enough. Constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly impossible.  Eisenberg doesn't help his case by the offbeat and idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses. Doctors, divorcees, `downshifters', and very little real data shed little light on the real issues. Maybe I knew too much going in. Maybe I expected too much from a few positive references from other sources. In the middle I was confused. By the end I was simply disappointed. And I have my own number, and it changes every day 
 OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.  Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?  Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.  I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook 
 Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up. If you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off, wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one 
 I had heard about the earlier version(s) of this book as 'a definitive text' on Software Engineering.  Never got a chance to read those versions.  I can only hope that the earlier versions were somewhat better than this.  1. The text is verbose, difficult to read, doesn't help the reader to connect with the thought process of the author.  Given the nature of the subject, dry and rather difficult, it is the responsibility of the author to make it easy to read, especially when the author is a respected member of the software engineering community. The author has failed to shoulder the responsibility.  2. Many a times the text is outdated.  As an example, the whole chapter on Quality Management gives references to text published in 1981 and 1986. The author then claims, "Although these data are well over 20 years old, they remain applicable in a modern context" ... So absurd !!! Does the author mean that the Software Engineering discipline has failed to such an extent that the software industry (in general) is as bad as it was 20 years ago.    3. The organization of the book is pretty bad.  There are too many quotes, WebRefs, KeyPoints.  Some of the quotes are good, but many a times out of context. And when I think of it, one can publish "Quote of the day" kind of a column for more than a year using this book! (not a bad reason to buy a book ... unintented consequences ... it's like a defect in the software which is declared as a feature)   4. And finally, there is neither anything new nor anything original in this book.    The best advice I could find in this book was more applicable to the author than anybody else. And the advice is in the form of a quote at the end of the section 26.1.4. "It takes less time to do a thing right than to explain why you did it wrong   - H.W.Longfellow"     Dear Author, the readers deserve an explanation! 
 An "act of literary courage?" An act of courage, to be sure, to attempt to present his book as non-fiction, rather than the actual fiction it is 
 Let me see if I have this straight: The author suggests that women who CHOOSE to stay home and raise their kids should have the same kinds of benefits that those of us who go out every morning and MAKE A LIVING while also raising kids have rightly earned? There is an answer for the problem that the author cites: GET A JOB OUTSIDE THE HOME. 
 it is difficult to learn from. NO examples are found and I often found myself reading a section several times and still not feeling confident that I understood it 
 I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller.  Goes to show you some people have really bad taste.  The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog.  It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc.  I would NEVER purchase another book by this author.  Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can...  Charli 
 At the beginning, the author states that she is taking some liberties with characters, etc., the usual things authors do in order to better tell the story. No issue there.  It can't be later than 1941 in the book when Moroccan forces invade and devastate a Black Forest village that the family has left just the day before. Now there were in fact Moroccan and Algerian forces attached to the French forces, but the invasion of Germany proper began end of 1944/beginning of 1945. It would have been that much later that Moroccans attacked anything in Germany. In WWII, the entire war changed in the meantime.  That does not take away anything from God's work and protection and the family's faith which is inspirational (albeit, sometimes more focused on the being an Adventist than a follower of Jesus Christ). However, taking liberties to the point that the personal story disconnects from history in general does more damage to the story than simplify anything.   I have not finished the book yet, and while the story itself has me curious about the rest, I wonder whether I would find more inaccuracies. I understand that such a story is hard to tell in all details, but when there are obvious things that are wrong, you are left wondering a bit 
 The story "Finding Nemo" is a nice kid's story, but this book does a very lousy job telling it.  It doesn't flow well at all and is just poorly written (or edited?).  I definitely would not recommend this book.  
 I found it very annoying that the makers of this version felt the need to have everyone keep teaching little lessons and reciting little morals to Alice.  As another reviewer has said, that is contrary to the whole spirit of the books and contrary to their original intent.  (A similar outrage was perpetrated by the makers of the TV movie "The Odyssey," where--contrary to Homer--we see Odysseus having to learn little life lessons before he is allowed to go home.)  What I did like, though, was some of the casting, especially Whoopi Goldberg as the Cheshire Cat and Sian Phillips as the Red Queen.  For those who want a good version of one of the Alices, the one starring Kate Beckinsale is actually rather good.  It keeps to the events of "Through the Looking Glass" and it has a good absurdist tone 
 I had high hopes based on the jacket and blurbs on the back.  Dobyns writes like a talented high-school student in love with his own ideas.  He has no feel for the English language, his characters are flat and ridiculous, and he hits you in the face with his stupid ideas.  I hate this book 
 In February 2007 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that, "most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities."  This conclusion was endorsed by the national scientific academies of the U.S, U.K., Canada, Russian, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Brazil, China, and India, along with numerous other scientific societies around the world.  Christopher Horner disagrees, as do a few scientists and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.  So if you want to believe that there's no anthropogenic global warming, you're stuck with having to explain why the experts got it wrong, and there are two ways to do this.  The hard way is to get some scientists together, do some experiments, and come up with a theory that explains the data better than the existing theory.  Submit your theory to peer review, and argue your case with more data and theory.  The easy way is to get some lawyers and come up with a conspiracy theory.  Conspiracy theories are fun because they require little effort and they always give you the answer you want.  And they're indestructible!  Evidence against the conspiracy theory is proof of the conspiracy.  Lack of evidence for the conspiracy is proof that it's a good conspiracy.  Oliver Stone made a movie about a conspiracy theory, and it was nominated for 8 Academy Awards.  Christopher Horner's conspiracy theory is about 1000 times more complicated than Oliver Stone's.  It requires scientists from all over the world, including people of all sorts of religious, ethnic, and political persuasions to be embroiled.  It requires oodles of falsified data to be published in the most prestigious journals and willfully misinterpreted by compliant funding agencies.  As usual, the media and the UN are in on it too.  Oh, and Horner suggests that the motive for the conspiracy is communism.  Communism!  The Cubans and the mafia must be feeling left out.  Is there any proof that the world's scientific community is in the grips of a communist conspiracy?  Of course not -- that's how we know the conspiracy is working.  The publishers of the Politically Incorrect Guides are really on to something.  If something bothers you, they will sell you a conspiracy theory to make you feel better about it.  Given that conspiracy theories require almost no research, the profit margin has got to be huge.  Heck they published a guide to the science of Intelligent Design more than a year after the guys who invented Intelligent Design admitted that there was no science behind it.  The plot of this one had the world's biologists, geologists, and paleontologists in an atheist conspiracy.  The weird thing is that there is no end of shady dealings in the real world that one could worry about.  Why make up a bunch of wacky conspiracy theories?  I guess it's fun to pick on egghead scientists, but I think you should consider the possibility that your outrage might be more effectively directed elsewhere 
 I was disappointed. After reading the other reviews I expected something useful but this book is so basic it looked like the authors just threw together a few articles and basic web research. I would recommend this book only if you have no experience in business, have never taken a business course, nor read any other book on business ever 
 This book is hardly the ideal "mad scientist in suburbia" tale. It was read in one sitting...literally. I did not move from underneath the covers of my bed, but my wanton lethargy was not the result of an example of riveting literature. The book didn't need to go atilt on the BSA. Wasn't a rant--WAS a distraction. The tale just wasn't very interesting. Pragmatism must acquiesce to the rapture of dark allegory, and morbid chuckles were my anticipation. Look at the title; how could I reasonably anticipate anything else?? BLAH 
 This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
 The first few chapters got me up to speed on how to get around Flash and make simple animations, etc. However the last half of the book was too cursory and provided very little information on how to publish your Flash documents on the web. Additionally, many areas in this book are not up-to-date for Flash MX and instead actually refer to the Flash 5 version. My final recommendation is look for another intro Flash MX book because this one does a half-ass job, even for a Dummy for like me 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 i hated these shakers. i got them as a gift and 1. they are too big and take up too much space and 2. the rubber stoppers were not a tight fit so the salt and pepper was always leaking out the bottom and 3. the holes in the top are too big and too much comes out at once. finally one broke and i was thrilled to toss them out. the other, smaller fiesta ware ones -- the round ones -- are much much better 
 This book is a joke...There are NO Secrets to be learned here. It is written by someone who knows nothing about Tattooing and even less about telling you how to do anything. All it is is a bunch of in series photos of tattooing with a small explanation (nothing informative)with each photo, and you learn nothing from it at all. My Opinion...A TOTAL WASTE OF PAPER! Tells nothing about what you need to know to be able to do the same kind of work, which, by the way was about 75% garbage work and maybe 25% talent. Overall I wouldn't waste your money on this one! If I could give it minus stars for a rating I would 
 Usually, I avoid soundtrack cds, but this one was on sale and it had some great names on it. Half of the songs are ok, but putting them together on a disc doesn't make a good album. You can hear the various styles of the  participating artists colliding. U2, Nick Cave, Herbert Gronemeyer,  Anderson? What do these artists have in common apart from their admiration  for Wim Wenders. Like the movie, the album is an artistic overkill. It's  just too much. The instrumental parts at the end are a complete waste. They  can't surive without the images in the movie. Avoid this album unless you  want a sampler to discover some new artists. But don't play it from a to z 
 I'm surprised no other reviewer noticed! Why did Penquin place Ronald Colman and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. prominently on the cover? In this reviewer's opinion, they must secretly realize that the wonderful 1937 classic film vastly outshines the printed word. I found the  story to be poorly written and hard to follow. Its' style is too formal, too flowery and too wordy!	If I had not seen (both) versions of the film, I could not have followed the "action". I constantly referred back to mental images of the movie to orientate myself. A review of "PZ" boils down to a basic truth: While most agree that the book is usually superior, occasionally the movie wins out. "PZ" is a prime example. ("Strangers on a Train" is another!). As for the so -called sequel, "Rupert of Hentzau"- don't even bother, unless you are an Anthony Hope fanatic. Reviewing the book makes one appreciate-once again- that wonderful film fadeout as Ronald Colman rides off over the hill. Since it happens to be available on amazon, click on the movie reviews. Therein will lie the essence of the wonderful adventure story of "The Prisoner of Zenda" 
 I bought this with great anticipation.  I was quite disappointed when I got it.  Billy Idol was never one of my favorites.  I don't recommend this one.  Save your money for something else 
 It seems that the only books that the Bush administration and the neocons read were "Brave New World", "1984" and Marvel Comics "Judge Dread".  The results appear here as a garbled account for the innocent abroad and judging by its ratings it's hit its intended target audience of drones squarely between the knees.  Toilet paper is cheaper and will provide hours of endless scatalogical entertainment instead for all "ye good ole boys".  
 opened the sealed DVD case and Get Shorty was inside and not the Usual Suspects.   I sent it back requesting a replacement and did not get a replacement.  I got a credit, I think.  Not sure.  I would rather just have the correct movie 
 this was certainly not one of Cornwell's best works.  IT was almost like a couple of possible novels rolled into one.  It read like a draft for a novel rather tahn a complete novel 
 One day I decided I needed to read every type of book out there. I usually ready fantasy novels. I wanted to know if I'd be interested in other books besides fantasy. I picked up a horror novel and it was slightly entertaining. Started to read a historical fiction novel but never finished. Then I picked up this up. I read the whole thing and decided never again to read a romance novel. This guy I forget his name now but he was so pathetic and weird. He wants to marry some girl from the telephone...stupid! But what pissed me off was the ending! DUMB 
 I bought this book expecting to immerse myself in an epic struggle of Good vs. Evil.  I got a facile tale of the Southwest.  Buyers beware!  This is not the Miltonian epic, but rather a wolf in sheep's clothing 
 I'm a pretty tough guy, so clearly I thought these pants would be a good fit. But the other day, while I was wrestling a shark the inseam on the left leg of these pants ripped!   Verdict: THESE PANTS ARE NOT TOUGH ENOUG 
 I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable.  After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq.  However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.  Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction?  As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, "the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong," which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility.  You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction 
 Sure,this cover can say she looks good and trying to look hot.She's trying so hard to give off an image that's not her.She's being and mostly acts like a tramp.Have you seen her videos?  Brintey can not break out of her shell and between the rebelious and outrageous lyrics,I see a sad girl being consumed by the media.Sure,she laughs and she looks as if she is having a good time on her videos but come on!Briney hides behind her clothes and lyrics and her record deal.It's all tenn pop lyrics penned down on her notepad while she's waiting in line!  I am dissapointed and I hope she writes better songs but from the heart,go Britney!Britney rock on please! 
 I agree with the other customers of this guide that there is no detail except for in a few spots at all. I mean what do you do after you defeat all of the  the elite 4? And when you walk up to a trainer his pokemon could stink or they might whip yours. So whatever you do DON'T by this guide. Please 
 Summoning the spirit of William Bartram, Bill Belleville offers a description of the lands, people, water, wilderness, and animals around the St. Johns River in Florida. Belleville clearly likes to identify with Bartram, even refering to him as "Billy" based on a single letter from Henry Laurens to Bartram's father. Belleville is an excellent writer and offers a compelling narrative.   Yet there is much that I find disturbing about this book. Belleville's grasp of history is not very strong. While he gushes about the French Hugenot colonial experience, he seems to have little to say about the Spanish. The French were in Florida for the better part of two years; the Spanish were in Florida for well over two centuries. Belleville seems to have little to say about the black experience in Florida either. No record survives of what happened to the slaves "Billy" Bartram abandoned when his plantation went under. Maybe "Billy" was not the saint that Belleville seems to think.   Worse, Belleville seems to have little use for a lot of people. He does not like toursits. He does not like the city of Jacksonville. He resents development and so on. All well and good. But the tide of humanity, both past and present, are some of the strongest factors in what makes the St. Johns unique and it's something Belleville does not seem to fully appreciate.   
 My 3220G died as soon as I applied the latest firmware. I had first tried the 6620G ($750!) and it froze up constantly, lost its wireless grip, didn't return reliably to location settings... All in all a great concept but D-Link doesn't deliver. No tech support. Don't waste your time with these cameras. I had to return both the 3220G and 6620G to Amazon. 
 I'd give this machine 5 stars if #1)it wasn't so expensive and #2), it wasn't so darn small.  It barely fits anything inside.  It works well for pacifiers and a rattle or two, but that's about it.  Anything else just won't fit.  And the design of the inside, with the piece in the middle, makes it even more restricting.  In my personal opinion, this product is not worth the money.  I am so disappointed, because it sounded so perfect.  But, its just not 
 I was very dissapointed when this book came and there was a large sticker saying $2.99 on it.  I paid $4.99 and it only has 80 pages 
 i am a huge De Lint fan, but i cannot drag myself through Moonheart.  this is an early attempt by him to solidify his ideas about celtic and native american mythology and their presence in a modern setting, and for that perhaps it was groundbreaking at the time, but after his later books, this is painful to read.  the characters are largely flat, though the setting of tamson house is a good and intriguing one. the super secret paranormal branch of the canadian mounties (!) is never made believable or interesting and i kept losing track of the cops' names, which didn't matter as they kept dying anyway.  anytime he creates a character of a specific ethnicity, the cartoonish stereotyping and deeply labored ethnic dialogue are painful to behold (i.e., the "rasta" man who begins every sentence with "I and I"); the character of keiran with his constant declarations of "NOM DE TOUT!" and "LORD JUMPIN' JESUS!" is annoying beyond endurance -- and furthermore, what is he supposed to be, french canadian or southern gothic with those odd declarations?  the scenes with the native american "manitou" read like bad B westerns written by Carlos Castaneda.  do read De Lint, but don't start here.  his later books based in fictional Newford are his best, especially the books that are collected short stories -- they're wonderful.  if you want to read one of his early Ottawa-based books, read Jack of Kinrowan which combines two shorter novels into one and which is far, far better done.  i'd hate to have someone pick up Moonheart and think that's all there is to De Lint 
 I have been a Beatles fan since 1964, and I have distinct memories of the band's influence on my young life.  I saw Hard Day's Night, Help!, Yellow Submarine, and Let It Be in the theater when they were first released.  This film has always been the Holy Grail of Beatle fandom.  Now that I own it, I can honestly say I understand why it took so long to release it to the public.  That thirty years of isolation, locked up in a vault somewhere in London, only improved its standing in my imagination, not on actual film.  The BBC was right to bury this.  As a film, or television special, it's horrible.  But as a fan, I had to have it.  Now, that's all I can say about it; I own it.  When will Let It Be be released 
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 I bought and read this book for a class and found it very difficult to take much away from. The accounts are potentially very enlightening, but the author's writing style obfuscates their values. Her interjection of her own personal stories into the work was sloppy and often left me unsure of who I was reading about. While I don't know of any other book which tells these stories, there are many other books that contain similar accounts which are far more effective 
 I've been running Spyware Doctor for 4 years, and was having problems with v4 using massive amounts of memory.  So I followed advice from the PC Tools homepage and loaded v5--BIG MISTAKE!  Since installing the new version and downloading the updates (a bad experience in itself, filled with ominous error messages from Windows), I've had to reload the code, reboot numerous times, had 2 Windows crashes and if the OnGuard facility is left running Spyware Doctor consumes 98% CPU for 5 minutes on every screen scroll done reading html text on a site identified as trusted. Oh and the company quietly changed it's policy and has hijacked my credit card information in order to automatically renew registration. I won't be running any more PC Tools products 
 I have been a devoted Hiaasen fan from the beginning and awaited all his novels which are few and far between with much excited anticipation.  Although his writing remains flawless and some of his lines are hysterical, the story is just so silly I found it hard to keep my attention focused.  I compare reading this book with watching a sponge bob cartoon which I do with my children on occasion.  Sorry, I just couldn't finish it 
 I must say I'm really bemused at the top reviews this score has received from some of the top soundtrack critics. I'm new to Desplat's music and was really expecting something quite special and enjoyable with this score after reading some of those reviews, however, I really don't see how this score can be regarded as anything other than often monotonous, passable underscore. I haven't seen the movie, and I can sense that the music would certainly be apt but I'm afraid that as a seperate listening experience, there is very little music here that could be described as memorable or impressive. 
 i bought this book to help me get over some resentment and anger i had  toward my husband.  this book did not help me.  in fact, i havn't even got  past the 3rd chapter.  it's very hard to follow and doesn't really tell you  how to get over the pain.  there's alot of long words and the same words  and phrases are used over and over again.  i do not suggest this book 
 I've had this thing for two weeks.  Coming from the Blackberry 8700c, this phone is a big disappointment.  Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and I'm stuck with it.  All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.   The more I use the thing the less I like it.  Here's my list, good and bad.  * Battery life - attrocious.  Use the extended battery, throw away the standard one.  Trust me.  Grade: D.  * Navigation - cumbersome.  The keys are too small, the 5-way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally.  Workable if you don't have huge hands.  Grade: B  * Windows Mobile - I hate it.  Why do applications not quit when you end them?  Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager.  The menu is pre-loaded with goodies to buy from Cingular, how convenient.  Grade: C+ if you bother to learn the shortcut keys.  * Java is broken, Google email doesn't work.  Maps DOES work with the new version, thankfully.  Grade: C.  * No standard headphone jack.  HELLO??  This is suppose to be an MP3 player, right?  Somebody explain to me why this is OK.  Grade: F.  * Phone quality - Grade A.  Yes, they did something right.  The phone works great, reception is great, speakerphone is great.  Bluetooth is great.   * Outlook & email - This is workable, but difficult.  You can write an email, you can edit your schedule and tasks, but it's not easy.  If Blackberry gets and "A" (and it does), Blackjack gets a C.  It doesn't synch notes, so if you're an Outlook Notes person you're just left out, sorry.  Why??  * Hardware quality - Very good, B+.  The thing really feels solidly built.  The screen is vibrant and attractive.  The camera seems to work fine, although I may use it twice per year.  In short, if you really want to get work done on your phone get a Blackberry.  If you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice, this could be the one for you. 
 to be quite frank, he could have done better, the content was informative but his explanation were too wordy and repetative. he could have explained his system thinking theory's in half as much time by sticking to the point,  not adding paraphrases that were confusing and misleading. question is  "does he get paid by the number of words he uses or the  content?" 
 This book was the worst in his series so far.  Loved the first three books he wrote, although it was already obvious that he was in trouble. He just lost control! GRRM has a good imagination, but lacks an "inner editor".   He keeps inventing new subplots and characters, spreading your attention so thin that you essentially stop caring about the story. The story arc is broken.   The most laughable thing about GRRM introducing new characters (even minor ones) is when he crams whole background stories in blocks of a few sentences... while quite a few of these minor characters could be omitted altogether. He seems in love with his own imagination, unable to let go. I don't think it's greed... it's incompetence.  Oh... and GRRM's recommendation on Robin Hobb's "Assassin's Quest" books: "A diamond in a sea of zircons" is spot-on... his own writing is definitely one of the zircons. Read Robin Hobb instead 
 I grew up with this story - what happened?!  Somewhere in this grossly underproduced version they forgot that even in a kids story you need talented actors.  Kids know when someone sounds wooden and unskilled - and you can't pawn something as poorly done as this off on them.  They're smarter than that!  I could've done a better job in my garage.  "Under the bridge lived a troll..."  Come on 
 I enjoyed "Temple" but this book was just awful.  Reilly's books are full of amazing, improbable but fun action scenes.  You spend a few hours suspending common sense but having a good time.  In this book however there were two elements that were just so bad that they ruined the rest of the adventure.  1) The career Marine captain has a romance with an NCO who reports to him.    and 2)There was a bear family that played a key role in the story - mama bear, baby bear and papa bear.  Right.  The only place you will fine a papa bear in a bear family is in Goldylocks.  Read "Temple" instead 
 This book doesn't explain anything.  It just shows a bunch of formulas and doesn't give any hint about when and how to use them one.  One of the worst textbooks I've encountered in college (and I'm in my last semester).  I wholeheartedly agree with all the negative feedback 
 This was given to my 2 year old as a present.  It is really cute and he loved it but it is constantly falling apart.  The roof and doors keep coming off every time it is played with.  The concept is good, all the animals and farmer are built very well, but it's frustrating to me and my son that it won't stay together. 
 This wasn't any good as a hardback and reissuing it in paperback doesn't change matters. To get an idea of what you are in for, see the reviews of the hardback version. Bottom line: don't waste your money 
 I've read many books on Tupac. Cathy Scott accounts several things that contradict what everyone else has already stated as fact. The only new thing, that everyone already didn't know, she brought to the table was the autopsy photo. Which being a big Tupac fan, I could have lived my entire life without seeing. It took me two hours to read this book. I want those two hours of my life back!!!!! 
 I have to admit I was disappointed in this book.  I ordered it because I knew the author, Harvey C. Parker was involved in CHADD, a support group for parents of children with ADD.  This book does a good job covering the basics, but if you are already an educated parent about ADD and strategies, it offers nothing new or advanced.  I'd say this book might be helpful for a parent who has a child aged 4-6, and who knows very little about ADD.  The sticker charts in the book are definitely geared toward younger children.  One example:  there is a "Good Bedtime Behavior" chart with a picture of a bed with a teddy bear on it.  There are ten circles on the headboard/footboard of the bed to put stickers on for behaving at bedtime.  Definitely not for my ten year old boy 
 This book reveals just how precious and convoluted the process of cooking has become for the self-consciously culinarily sophisticated. As a previous reviewer has mentioned, many of its recipes require obscure ingredients or time consuming procedures which when closely examined would appear to have been included for the sake of sheer novelty. Case in point: the author asks the cook in several of the recipes to braid a "rope" from flour and water which is then placed inside the lid of the cooking pot, ostensibly as a seal. After cooking, this "rope" is discarded. Since most well-made casserole dishes or large stewpots include tight-sealing lids, this extra maneuver can only be viewed as the sort of one-upsmanship beloved by upscale cooks with too much time on their hands. Likewise, complex steps such as rendering one's own lard (which the author requires the cook to do in more than one recipe) or tracking down expensive, obscure spices which will in all likelihood be used only once, and then in minute quantity, simply do not justify the time or effort involved. The basic idea of a stew is to create a tasty, satisfying one-pot meal from available ingredients. When it takes weeks to assemble the ingredients and more than a day to prepare the dish, somebody is definitely missing the point.   Another problem with "Real Stews" is its seeming obsession with the exotic over the familiar. All cultures have delicious culinary traditions -- well, at least most of them do -- but to insist that American cooks precisely duplicate the ingredients and cooking conditions necessary for ethnic verisimilitude smacks of snobbery at best and condescension at worst. A little more emphasis on user-friendly and, dare it be said, familiar recipes would have made this book considerably more useful. As it is, for most home cooks, it's likely to gather considerable dust. 
 I've read all and enjoyed most of Herman's novels. Of all of them, this is my least favorite.  C'mon Richard...we know you can do better.  Give us characters we can care about 
 Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol.  That was particularly annoying.  He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
 Aries Spears is cool, but I guess that I set my expectations too high for this one...I should have bought "I Ain't Scared" instead...I'll be selling this one immediately 
 worthless -- seems like the author wrote the book so she could talk all about herself -- who cares about her favorite CD.....and for maybe one pattern worth knitting, the book is certainly not worth spending money on 
 I don't know if my experience is not enough to comment about this. However, I am writing this because this book rating is "too" much higher than it is deserved. This book is really "bad" for anyone looking for the good analog circuit layout design. This is just fair for some one looking for digital circuit layout. The entire topics covered in this book could be taught in a couple of hours meeting with the experieced layout engineer. The contents of this book are not only shallow but also miss the most of the important aspects in the layout. I borrowed this book from the my school library and looked over the most of topics. I never open this book again since the first day I read the book. I am a Ph'D student in the mixed circuit research area. I mostly refer 'CMOS Circuit Design, Layout, and Simulation' by Jacob Baker and 'Art of Analog Layout' by Hasting whenever I need help in the layout design 
 Despite what others would have me believe, I do not remember chuckling, much less laughing, at any moment while reading this book.  I just kept patiently waiting for a story, or even a point, to surface, but after finishing the Epilogue I didn't find either 
 The author does an acceptable job of presenting _what_ his opinion is, but a very poor job of explaining _why_ anyone else should share that opinion.  The footnotes and references he introduces are only rarely pertinent and never compelling to the sweeping conclusions he draws.  For example, as support for his premise that global warming and climate change (a claim which is still heatedly debated among scientists and far from being established as fact) will impact the United States' ability to project power, he invokes a single article in the NYT referencing a white house press release that carbon emissions _may_ be a factor.  Wow.  Gosh, I'm convinced.  The book is full of such cases where the author cogently and effectively presents an alternative or scenario which _may_ be true, and then blithely moves on sans proof or support of _why_ it is true to spend the next ten pages describing how that unproven premise will impact the United States and its role in the world.  The author may be correct in his suppositions and conclusions.  But I found I couldn't focus on his points since he left such glaring holes in the chain of reasoning by which he reaches those conclusions.  If you're going to say "If X then Y", you'd better spend some time showing that X is actually the case before you spend pages and pages talking about the impact of Y if you want anyone to care.  "If martians prefer bic lighters to zippos, then clearly the democratic party needs to move more toward the political center" is insufficient justification for then spending 15 pages on talking about why the political center is good for democrats.  A minor peeve of mine was that the author seemed to fall in love with his own clever terminology for things.  For example, he introduces and then gauzily defines the term "soft power" early in the book, and then never misses a chance to refer to how this or that factor might impact a nation's soft power.  To readers who weren't convinced (for the reasons outlined above) in even the _existence_ of soft power, these continuing references are at best annoying and at worst irrelevant 
 It is a cheap soccer shoe with little support. the tongue extends about 1" past the last lacing hole and digs into your ankle, one inch is also not enough for it to be bent back over the laces so it is sufficiently awkward and was enough for me to return the shoe. unfortunately no free returns so i'll be shopping elsewhere for my indoor soccer shoes. typically i wear a size 13, however these were about a size too large on me so i'd wear a 12 in this shoe. i have a pair of asics running sheos, lotto cleats and new balance cross trainers that are all 13 
 I love a good "who done it", and its even better if it adds a little humor. But come on! This story had more loose ends then a ball of yarn that my cat Socks just finished with. Tamar introduces a character and  then they disappear. She starts a story line and then stops it. She uses  more worn out phrases then 14 grandmothers at a AARP meeting. I did get a  laugh here and there, but most of the story was spent trying to understand  the lastest branch of her tree. a couple of the sub-characters are ok, the  police chief never develops, her sister never develops and the deal with  her husband already being married just lays there.  Summing it up. A good  idea for story line, too many weak characters, and too many side trips. I  do have to say that a book is like a work of art, some people love it, some  hate it and a few like myself would rather have had eggroll 
 The control of PowerPoint is excellet except the blank screen button is often accidentally pressed during the presentation.  The laser is very weak and dies often in the middle of a presentation-rather frustrating.  I liked the flash memory initially, but found it troublesome because it takes extra time for the PC to recongnize it and a folder always pops up 
 I must admit. I am not Kings biggest fan. I like the way he writes characters, but for years, I haven't been able to put my finger on why I don't like his books. After reading The Colorado Kid, I realized what it was. King is a lazy writer. He can tell a good story, but he doesn't follow through. His typical way out of a jamb is to make some inanimate object talk. Bleh. You can tell when he is done with a story. It just ends.  This book is no exception. The story rambles through the mouth of a clichï¿½d old time reporter teaching a young'un the ropes. King tells the story, he doesn't show it. I kept waiting for the narrative to stop and for the action to begin, but it never did.  And the ending! Someone, his editor, agent, family or friends, tell Mr. King that mysteries are supposed to be resolved. He doesn't resolve this mystery. That was the only reason, other than the fact that I had a 7 hour flight and nothing else to do, that kept me reading. I got to the end and I swear I almost tossed the book while on the plane. There is an after word trying to justify his ending. I didn't get past the first sentence. Authors don't write justifications for their books unless they know they are guilty of something.  If I could take away all the stars on this book, I would. Even one star is one too many. 
 At 624 pages, What to Eat certainly looks appealing and authoritative. However, while Nestle's book does contain some good information, it doesn't live up to it's bold title. I was expecting more of a treatise on healthful foods, mixed with an equal part of what foods to avoid. Instead, Nestle focuses entirely on what to avoid, brushing off, for example, vegetables with a single, scant chapter. Now, I could see the value even in this approach, but the organization of the book (a meandering collection of chapters that do not flow coherently) and Nestle's odd tone of not giving a very clear opinion of what to avoid or not to avoid, mars the book's practical value significantly. A better book that fulfills her objective more thoroughly is Andrew Weil's Eating Better for Optimum Health, which covers almost entirely the same topics, while being thoughtfully organized and much more informative. 
 I know this review is going to sound repetitive but I shall have my say.  Kasabian's first cd was a good listen with about five quality songs, no songs I found to be terrible.  This cd on the other hand, with the exception of the first two songs, Empire and Shoot The Runner, is unlistenable.  I barely made it through one listen and haven't listened to it since.  This is a career ender.  Kasabian had such potential, it is a shame they had to waste it on this garbage 
 _History on Trial:  My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier_ by Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt is supposed to be an account of her experiences with the historian David Irving in court after being sued by him.  Let me begin by saying that I believe the Holocaust did occur and accept the "convergence of evidence" proof as the correct one.  However, what I hate to see is this tragic event used as a political weapon.  Professor Lipstadt wrote a book (_Denying the Holocaust_)  in which she basically lumped all far right and far left theorists in with Holocaust deniers.  Among others she included Noam Chomsky, Patrick Buchanan, revisionist historian Harry Elmer Barnes, and the Libertarian party (described by her as a "fringe group") in with Holocaust deniers.  She also called for these individuals to be publicly excoriated for their alleged denial and to face stiffer public penalties for doing so.  In this present book describing the trial, she also describes Mel Gibson (not his father mind you!) and Norman Finkelstein as potential deniers.  One of these "vipers" who she referred to as a denier was David Irving, an autodidact historian with a somewhat dubious history.  Many of Irving's historical claims are highly dubious and as this book shows in many points he is a denier.  However, the question remains as to whether Irving has a right to express these views in any forum at all.  I believe the answer to this question to be absolutely.  There are two reasons for this.  First, he may actually believe what he writes to be true, in which case he is merely describing historical events as he sees them.  And secondly, there is the freedom of speech issue.  Currently, Irving is in a prison in Europe after being arrested for publicly denying the Holocaust.  What the politically correct have failed to realize is that not only have they made a martyr out of Irving and his ilk, but they have re-inforced the conspiracist worldview that sees the government as largely controlled by totalitarian politically correct forces.  To put it simply, the tragedy of the Holocaust is being used as a means for political gain by the ultra-politically correct.  Judging from what I've read of the case, it appears that Professor Lipstadt went after Irving, calling for stiffer public penalties for Holocaust deniers, and leading a movement to drive them underground.  While Irving's behavior was certainly despicable (particularly as concerns his litigious record and his tendencies to publicly abuse survivors), after reading this book I cannot say that Professor Lipstadt's behavior was any less despicable.  In any event, Irving sued Lipstadt and her publishing company Penguin for libel in England claiming that they were part of a worldwide conspiracy to suppress the truth.  The rest of this book is a rather boring (actually) detailed account and debunking of Irving's historical theories in court.  Irving comes across as a charlatan who fiddles with historical records as he sees fit.  On the other hand, Lipstadt comes across as an incorrigible politically correct activist who sees anti-Semitism, racism, and prejudice everywhere.  Lipstadt spends a good part of this book defending her Jewishness, making side comments about her inner state and vapid appeals to emotion, and commenting on the alleged anti-Semitism in the various plays and books she sees and reads while involved in the trial.  One has to wonder after reading Lipstadt's book if there is such a thing as legitimate criticism of the Jews, if the Jews are not above criticism, and if all criticism of Jews, Jewish organizations, or Israel is anti-Semitism.  Nevertheless, I believe she has the right to publish her views in the same way that Irving has the right to publish his.  What is despicable though is that a courtroom was required to rule on a matter of history and to rule so far as to the correct historical interpretation.  Ultimately Irving was driven underground after having lost and was forced to pay the court fees driving him into bankruptcy.  Subsequently he was arrested in Austria for his denial and is currently serving a prison sentence.  The ultimate result of all of this is that while Lipstadt was vindicated and allowed to precede with the continued publication of her rather nauseous works (as is her right of course) it will lead to a situation where historians become afraid to take unpopular or controversial views on historical matters.  Revisionism is a legitimate enterprise and while Holocaust denial may be highly malignant, not all revisionism is denial.  It is likely that in the future this situation will present a slippery slope where mainstream historical interpretation comes to be enforced in the courts and stiff penalties exist for those historians who do not toe the line (shades of 1984).  While Lipstadt certainly has the right to publish her views and the case was likely decided correctly on that point, the ultimate result of the situation has been a despicable one on all sides 
 I expected great things from Cabot's books. I was let down. I did not care for her writing style, nor did I find her information moving or educational. I am genuinely surprised that so many people find Cabot to be a literary value. I just don't see it. I would not recommend Cabot's works to anyone interested in paganism or witchcraft 
 VALIS is PKD's quasi-autobiographical crazy mystical science fiction speculations about God.  This isn't a piece of fiction as much as it is a bunch of nonsensical fantasies about the nature of god pulled from nowhere.  This work is nowhere near the quality of PKD's *actual* science fiction, and I don't recommend that anybody bother reading this book.  Stick to the earlier stuff 
 The only thing perhaps more moronic than this tripe is those who have let themselves be bamboozled into thinking that there is something of deep thought and/or substance here.  I can only assume that those who found this entertaining are extremely insecure and think that if they like something that others who are perceived to be "important" like that they too will be "important".  The part of this I truly find mind-numbing is her "deep" and "thoughtful" insight into the solution to the violence/terrorism in the world;  all we need is "vagina warriors" working at the "grass-roots level".  You know what, let me reconsider my first observation; to call this moronic is an insult to morons everywhere.  It's sub-moronic 
 I liked Time magazine a lot until they named George Bush person of the year? Oh my god, where were all the educated editors/writers when they let this moron write this article 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
  How could a book about labour ignore the most important issues of social class, race, and gender?  The book is really a collection of rah-rah essays on unions in America lacking in any analysis and rigor about the lives of workers in the U.S.  An obsequious effort to gather all perspectives without taking a position.  Why is there no critical examination of issues of race in this work?  The work does not have any essay by rank-and-file workers and seems to see the unions moving ahead by continuing in their old ways.  
 This battery only gives me about an hour of playing time on my Philips PET724 7" Portable DVD/DivX Player.  After that it claims to have 75% charge left but can't even get the player to turn on and doesn't charge it if it's turned off 
 I am life time resident in Iquitos Peru and I know Bill Lamar, scientist who organise this trip.  I read book and can see immediately is write by someone who lack experience here.  I show recently it to Lamar, who say he never receive copy from the author!  He say nothing but chuckle lot as he look through pages.  He just smile and shake head and hand back to me.  I well read about this place and have over tirty year experience in the selva here. I know the general public is inocent about the Amazon.  Is this reason I feel compell to write and inform the public they should be VERY CAREFUL about what they read about the Amazon!!! This book has lot of hot air! One star only 
 i cannot, with good conscience recommend this movie.    please, look at it! it's awful!    drew barrymore, in her sad "poison ivy" stage, is a wretched performer.  there are pothole plothole's all over the place.  and it's itchy to watch the scene with her real mother, jaid barrymore.  were they attempting reconcilliation through a b-movie?  oh! and the guy from adventures in babysitting, father of the bride & a few episodes of friends is in it, fumbling around too. where is that guy?  there's a tough broad friend, a spooky house & at one point SPOILER: drew splits in half all oogy and walks around like some really skinny anatomy horror movie thingy.  hey! now it sounds kind of good again 
 The problem is that this book is biting off more than it can chew. (There also happen to be at least a couple of factual errors in it, though that may not be the fault of the author, I wonder about some of his sourcing.) Gup is trying to give us real insight into the lives of these fine folks who died in the service of their country and the world.   But, try as he does, he is missing critical context around many of the stories. The context is key to filling out what ends up otherwise as flat. The author's bias seems to be towards enlightening the world about convert operations - as if that in itself is a higher good. Unfortunately, while I must admit that at times the "government" paints with a broad brush when it "secretizes" things, nearly everything that has to do with clandestine service needs to be kept in the dark.    The fact is, that these men understood the "deal". They volunteered. They were heroes because they went willingly to do harder work than most people can imagine because they believed in it. They understood they might "win a goald star". They knew what it meant to win a medal only to have it stored it in a box at HQ.  But they didn't give a damn about the kind of recognition Gup wants to give them. Is it hard on the families? You're damn right it is. That's why the families are true heroes as well - sacrificing so much for something bigger than themselves. But that is also besides the point.   The context is where it's at. Tell the story of each of these people by explaining what THEY understood about the life and death of the geopolitics in which they operated - and WHY they chose to operate in it, Guppy, and maybe YOU'LL earn another star.   By the way, both the Agency and a reviewer got the quote out of context: It does say, "Know ye the truth and the truth shall set you free" but what follows is, "I am the way and the Truth and the life. Whoever believes in me shall not die but shall have eternal life." It is a quote from Mathew's Gospel.  The truth is always more complex than it may seem 
 I loved the movie; I hate the CD. Sadly, the music without the movie just doesn't cut it. Some of the songs don't even sound the same and there are some extra songs added in. I have wanted to order this CD forever and finally got around to doing it recently. I just lisetened to it for the first and last time. It will go out at my next garage sale. What a waste of money.  
 In Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth, justice, and the American way. Just the title represents everything true and good about him and America. For his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and Hannity's words are the validation of those beliefs.  If this was written by a ghost writer, he should have withheld payment. If it wasn't written by a ghostwriter, Hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole.  The first chapter is written in a maudlin, "those-were-the-good-old-days" wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity, and a believer in the American dream. But before you can say "Erin Go Braugh" he is talking about the courage of George W. Bush for standing up to terrorism. Exactly how G.W. does, he doesn't elaborate. How he goes from grandfather to Dubbya is a bit of magic.  Hannity's next trick is to impugn Clinton and Gore as being soft on terrorism. His source for this is, of all people, Dick Morris who knew the Clintons and now works for the Fox Republican Advocacy Network. He quotes Morris who makes such vague statements as "It seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism," or "they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism." These "Morris mind-reads" are conjectural, but Hannity uses them, which he does with impunity.  Let's take a closer look at Hannity's unimpeachable source for a moment. It was Dick Morris who quit the Clintons shortly after the second election. It was Morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers, did some jail time, and entered alcohol rehab. You'd think SH could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring!  But, Hannity doesn't skip a beat. He points out how democrats such as Senators Kerry and Daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills. What he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills, or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills, or the many defense bills that Kerry and Daschle did vote for. He never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by Dick Cheney when he was Secretary of Defense. Such deception is called propaganda.  Propaganda is something that Hannity has no compunction using here. This he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked. Namely, it is the story of President Clinton being offered Osama bin Laden by the Sudanese government. Again, it's what he doesn't say that misdirects the reader. Sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading, lifted. However, the FBI determined that the Sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin Laden. The Sudanese also made the offer to Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis had revoked bin Laden's citizenship, and refused to take him.  Benjamin Franklin said "Statistics is a liar." Hannity uses charts for the same purpose. He shows how under Reagan, the army bought over 500 tanks. Under Clinton, the army bought none. This leads one to the assumption that Clinton did nothing for the services. He doesn't mention that the army buys tanks, not presidents. He doesn't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the Soviet Union that never came. He doesn't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles.  Be grateful that Hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history. If he could, instead of seeing a dead Captain Ahab being killed by the whale in "Moby Dick," we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption: "I caught a fish this big!"  There's something very fishy about his facts, his historical parallels which aren't parallel, and what he chooses to tell you, and what he chooses to leave out.  In this book, he tells whale-sized whoppers!        
 Was hoping to get something a little more historical but it turned out to be a fantasy dinner loosely based on history.  I intentionally left the book on the airplane 
 This book is organized into chapter topics such as Cosmic inheritances, Being, Knowing, Society, Polity and so on. The value of the book is the extensive quotations he has assembled from Calvin on each of the chapter topics. In that sense, the book functions almost as an index of Calvin's thought, and it's valuable for scholars looking for quotations from Calvin on specific topics.   The title advertises the book as a biography, but it's not. Bouwsma states that the biographical facts of Calvin's life have been covered elsewhere, and he does not plan to revisit that ground. So we have a biography of Calvin which assumes that you have already read his biography elsewhere! Much of what Bouwsma argues doesn't make much sense without knowledge of Calvin's life and time. Dividing Calvin into arbitrary and abstract topic areas fragments his thought unnecessarily, distorting his life and thought.   Bouwsma sets up a strawman to his position, that Calvin's debt to Renaissance humanism has been ignored. This is not true at all. In fact, Calvin's debt to humanism is virtually a truism of Calvin scholarship. Unfortunately, Bouwsma's approach here is typical of post-modern revisionary historical scholarship.   Bouwsma's interpretation of Calvin is deeply problematic for a number of reasons. First of all, he portrays Calvin's thought as essentially a reaction to the uncertain times in which he lived, and to Calvin's own anxieties and fears. Calvin emerges here as depressed, anxious, and neurotic. That's a very one-sided view, and there's just not enough evidence to support that claim. It seems very reductive to interpret Calvin's theology as just an expression of his personal insecurities. What's missing here is any kind of larger historical perspective that can explore and appreciate the constructive dimension to his thought. Calvin is a hugely influential thinker who contributed to the development of modernity, but to read Bouwsma, one might think Calvin was merely an obscure pastor obsessed with his own anxieties 
 King certainly lends a high-profile to this collection of latter-day noir writing and tough-guy procedurals, but I believe he created something a little too far outside the readership's expected genre for this series. The setting and characters are recognizable (now trite?) staples of his beloved Maine coast, and he works at bringing their "down east" mannerisms to life with language that rings of "Bert & I" lobstermen. I wasn't particularly caught up in the aged newspapermen's tale of their quest to identify a mysterious dead man found on the local beach. And the ending ... well, um ... the ending is definitely an open-ender. King cleverly covers himself by adding a disclaimer of sorts that the story won't appeal to many readers. Yep. You got that right, Stephen. No gunplay, no boozers, no saucy dames, no double-crosses, no slangy patter, no real satisfaction for me. I suggest Hard Crime afficionados skip this entry and look to some of the heavy-hitters from the past 
 This movie is stupid beyond words. I watched a half hour of it and COULD NOT watch any more I was so lost and BORED. Makes no sense, talks about creepy gross and disgusting things, is boring and stupid!! Don't waste time on this dull as dust film 
 This was the first book I bought when I became interested in picture framing. Since then I have read many other books on the subject, met many professional picture framers, taken courses in the subject, joined the Professional Picture Framers Association, and basically learnt much much more about the subject. I CANNOT recommend this book to any one who is new to picture framing.  First, the information is scattered between many chapters, and is difficult to pull together.  Second, many very important topics receive very little coverage.  Third (the major problem for me): the author is first-and-foremost, a wood worker, and this is reflected in the book. Thus, there are many chapters discussing tools that most professional picture framers would never buy, methods that most professional picture framers would never use, inadequate discussion of conservation framing vs. non-conservation methods, mat cutting, etc.  If you are interested in making your own wood picture frames, this is the book for you.  If you are new to the subject or are interested in many of the other aspects of picture framing, you would be much better off with one or more books by David Logan, Vivian Kistler, or others 
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 I wonder if Muffy's therapist suggested writing this book. I had great hopes from the title and her bio,but this is more a personal essay on her own childhood and relationship with her mother than a book on 'slacker' motherhood. While I agree and enjoy some of her ideas, it wasn't the book I'd hoped. This is NOT in the 'Girlfriends Guides' vein, it's more a personal bio and idea of raising her own family 
 After watching this extremely low-budget film of a tale based on the historical story of "Hamlet" it was easy to see where all the money went: to the cast members.  The cast is loaded with potential.  It includes Gabriel Byrne, Helen Mirren, Christian Bale, a youthful looking Kate Beckinsale (she has come a long, long way since this film), and a plethora of the kind of actors that make you ask, "What other movie did I see that actor in?"  But the rest of the film fails to live up to this monumental promise.  For much of the movie it looks and feels like a made-for-television romp through medieval times.  It has a small cast of haggard-looking extras in peasant clothing, royalty that, if not for the crowns they wore, would be indistinguishable from the common herd, and some very predictable and flawed direction. The followers of the king, peasantry included, number about thirty in total and they all live in this small wooden village.  The director makes the mistake of using a large amount of voice-over narration to propel the story, which by the end was whittled down to about 90 minutes of Masterpiece Theater shot in the countryside.  One scene has Hamlet dashing from a buring hall, sword in hand, but when he rounds the corner of a building his sword is missing; cut to the following scene of Hamlet confronting the new king, his murderous uncle, and the sword reappears in his hand.  That kind of blatantly poor film editing is unforgivable.  The acting ranges from good to passable, but no amount of thespian zeal could have or did save this project from gradual diminishing returns.  Except for the sighting of a schoolgirl version of Kate Beckinsale, prim and proper as all young lasses tend to be, this film is sadly a waste of time and money.    
 I used to think this film was okay but it's really lame. He's going home only cause he wants a car, shows you how greedy people in america are about christmas. They only care about the material goods they get out of the overrated season 
 While this lens has an attractive price tag, this lens has serious trouble with sharpness. Only at high shutter speeds (1/250 and above approx.) or with a good flash and middle apertures (f/8 to f/22 approx.) does it deliver sharp images. Horribly slow autofocus. I am already saving to buy and L-series or the IS USM version 
 Read the review carefully -- I didn't and I'm sorry.  The Publisher's Weekly review called their designs "gaudy" and boy are they right.  Who in the world would have a Christmas tree in their house with a full sized mannequin stuffed into the tree dressed to look like Joan Crawford or Marilyn Monroe?  And get this -- in the Joan Crawford tree, they have swan ornaments which -- everyone will know when they see them -- represent Ms. Crawford's transformation from ugly duckling to swan.  Or how about the Lucille Ball tree -- disembodied hands holding brushes sticking out of the branches.  I won't even get into the Cher tree, because it scared me.  These people need to be visted by the ghosts of Christmas and have their heads straightened out. Please don't judge Los Angeles by these people -- I've lived here all my life and have never seen anything like this.  This is a true nightmare before Christmas! 
 When you see a group of 5-star reviews, in which all of the reviewers have only one review, and none of them have the "Real Name" badge, then you know that these reviews were all posted by the same person - someone who wants to hype the product.   Also, when you see that all of the reviews have the same quirk (no capitalization for example), then you can be *CERTAIN* that they were written by the same person.  
 This book is the evident that the housing projects in the United States are mere products of the market force that lack inspiration, imagination, and progressive attitude.  People who praise this book for its beautiful photographs only expose the biggest flaw in this book: there is no content.  All the homes in this book are built on false premises of consumerist culture.  There is no attempt to make the houses affordable or challenging the notion of domestic living.  People may have bought the book because they like the drape or the furniture in it, but you will be better off buying yourself a copy of Martha Stewart's "Living" for that purpose.  Don't waste your money on propelling the cycle of our wasteful culture, give that money to the charity and you will sleep better at night 
 Sorry I bought this book....it wasn't anything that I could follow thru on...guess I'll just stick to watching my 'over active fork'....T 
 The item arrived fine and intact, but upon opening the box I found myself staring at what I can only assume is someone's sick and twisted joke.  I spent 45 minutes trying to "assemble" the rack, with the side pegs falling out on me every time I tried to put another piece in place.  I finally got down to the bottom and the last side and noticed the piece meant for the bottom is curved in a way that makes it impossible to put in place.  I'd attempt to bend it straight but it seems about as brittle as dead tree bark.  I finally just figured with a bottom that brittle it would be all of a week before it was broken anyway and threw it in the trash, which is where it belongs I feel 
 The fatal problem is this book is NOT current to the 97 Uniform Building Code, contrary to the advertised description. It is written for the 94 Code. Therefore, it is useless and dangerous for actual design and permit. This book gives a pretty good tutorial, but asumes the reader to be an engineer already and skips key explanations of the process, showing numbers in formulas without referencing where they came from, what they mean, or what units they are measured in. Too cryptic. The reference data is scattered throughout the book, and often doesn't have a cross-reference, so it took me over an hour to read each page of problem, due to hunt-and-peck for clues. The design examples are fairly good but hard to follow, and the problem questions don't have answers or process to check your work. The subject is so complex that it would be scary to formulate a real life problem. The author left out the seismic factors on foundation design, so the answers are very wrong in earthquake areas. The 97 Code changed greatly from the 94  Code, so you will be struggling to learn erroneous information 
 I ordered an assortment of purses from the same company, but this one didn't arrive 
 There are some cuts that are pretty good but doesn't live up to my expections - i would much rather listen to Thug Motivation 10 
 Based on her own definition in this book, Ms. Coulter is liberal to the core. "If you cannot articulate your opponent's position, you are not an adult; you are a liberal."   Ms. Coulter is an articulate author with an admirable command of language. Her twists of the literary knife  are a pleasure to read, even when you realize that she has severed your necktie. Or your intestine. She has a penchant for making the same point three or five or six times using eight or twelve or twenty examples, which is about as pleasant as watching a pile driver hammer a steel rod into granite.  Her thesis is that the political opinions of mainstream American media are more liberal than those of mainstream America, affecting both the choice and treatment of news topics. She raises some cogent and disturbing points. Her opening  line, "Political debate in this country is insufferable," makes clear that she can and does address fundamental problems that transcend the issues of the moment.  She also identifies the cause of these problems in her first paragraph: "It's all liberal's fault." She judges the value of any action entirely by the political stance of the actor, regardless of the action itself. Liberals who characterize conservatives as "dumb" (i.e. every liberal, everywhere) are attacking their opponents personal traits because they are unable to create or express any meaningful arguments. She does not apply the same logic to her own statement such as "All liberals hate America," or "Liberals love pedophiles." She is certainly skilled in logic, as revealed in a hair-splitting analysis of why it is reprehensible for liberals to describe right wing ideas as "Nazi" in nature, but Rush Limbaugh's term "femin-Nazi" is a discerning and accurate characterization.  
 Bears all the hallmarks of its author's self-congratulatory self-conception: vain, witless vulgarizing, power-celeb worship and sitcommish woodenness posturing as astute "irony" and relevant commentary. Utter garbage 
 Robert Kennedy says that President Bush is responsible for Hurricane Katrina to hit New Orleans because of global warming.  Not the aftermath, mind you, but the ACTUAL HURRICANE!  Wow, didn't know Bush was a wizard and had the ability to create hurricanes.  But apparently Kennedy thinks so.  Maybe Robert Kennedy is a crime against nature, eh 
 Kohn's commercial thesis (and that's all it is, folks: a ruse to garner publicity and make the bestseller lists) is a worthy one: America's schoolchildren are being needlessly burdened with homework from an increasingly early age. The assigning of after-school busywork in particular is an inhumane practice, and parents have every right and obligation to challenge this wherever it occurs. But not all homework is busywork, and parents should also beware the extent of Kohn's silly progressive agenda before buying (and buying into) this silly book. It turns out that our esteemed children's advocate and self-appointed guru Alfie would like to see a lot of other cruelties excised from the schools besides homework, including grades, honor rolls, awards assemblies, competition, objective standards, tests and quizzes, adult supervision, and specific, substantive content. In fact, the essential premise of THE HOMEWORK MYTH, and Alfie's entire career as an edu-pundit, is the abolishment of teaching itself.  Like most progressive school reformers, Kohn has his own victimization story: he was once given a homework assignment he didn't like by his fifth-grade teacher, so he turned it in under the heading "Busywork" and received a reprimand for doing so. It's a funny anecdote (recounted in numerous interviews and articles; see Kohn's web site), but it's no doubt the tip of the iceberg: if there's one thing the progressive education movement consistently stands for, it's the righting of some bitterly harbored wrong that each progressive experienced at the hands of some monstrous teacher or another when they were children. As adult reformers, they seek justice for themselves by trying to impose new wrongs, and when they succeed, a whole generation ends up suffering as a result.  Ironically, Kohn's argument would be a good deal more powerful if he would temper it a bit. But no, he doesn't just want less homework; he wants no homework. Ever. The problem with this is that homework in itself is not inherently good or bad; as many of the studies Kohn cites actually show, it depends on the structure and objectives involved. My own position as a teacher is that students won't retain what they learn in school unless they apply it in their private lives--with moderation, of course. If students don't live what they learn to some extent, then what happens in the classroom doesn't matter. I believe this is particularly true of literacy: students who read widely and regularly at home are far more successful in school, not just in English but in all their classes. And because the roots of good writing are so closely linked to introspection, individual desire, and individual experience (to paraphrase the same observation from Annie Dillard that Kohn uses), it's impossible for students to develop their writing skills only within the time limits and distractions of the classroom.   Kohn also makes an arrogant broadside at Advanced Placement courses, something he apparently can't help doing in every one of his books, in much the same way that he can't resist ridiculing E.D. Hirsch at every opportunity. "Some very fine high schools have eliminated these courses because they tend to be so poor" (p.123). Why our humble advocate would choose the phrase "very fine high schools" instead of "exclusive private schools" is a mystery, but it seems to me like rather pertinent information. The growth of AP classes in high schools across the country has arguably democratized the college admissions race by providing thousands of less privileged students access to college preparation, and thus access to college itself. But that doesn't matter to Kohn, who abhors any and all education based on objective standards, even if it helps provide the very kids whom he is presumably defending with the means to a better life. He characterizes AP classes as "poor," "lecture-based," and "textbook-oriented," a statement of such profound ignorance that it needs no refutation (but note this: the College Board makes no forced stipulations at all about teaching methods or texts, only recommendations). If elite prep-schools like New York's Fieldston are eliminating AP, it's quite likely because they're just that: elite prep schools that don't have to worry about their college admission levels one way or the other. They were no-doubt happy to offer AP when it was a rare and thus marketable thing, but now that it's déclassé (read: widely available to ordinary students) it's hardly a shock to learn that they're abandoning it in favor of their own designer electives.   Naturally an AP English class (which I teach) requires a lot of homework in the form of reading because it can't be done in the few hours of class time we have each week, and I was nearly thunderstruck to see Kohn list reading as one of the few forms of homework that "may be appropriate." Then the other shoe dropped: teachers mustn't tell students what to read, mustn't assign specified amounts or pages, and they must never, under any circumstances, require students to prove that they've read. Indeed, for a progressive reformer, Kohn comes off as quite the reactionary: he's against an awful lot of things, but what, exactly, is he for? No rules, no tests, no structure, no authority, no standards--just, apparently, schools emancipated from the iron rule of teachers, where children are free to pursue their own natural interests at their own natural paces, to dance and sing and cavort and write their names on the walls (if they can spell them), to learn only what they're intrinsically motivated to learn about (pyromania, anyone?), and above all, to just be themselves, be free, bless their tender, innocent hearts!  One more point: There is no such thing as a "`transmission' model of learning," Alfie, and you know it. This snide caricature, along with "drill and kill" and "sit'n'git," is one of the oldest and most disingenuous clichés in the progressivist's handbook. What you are referring to, as if you didn't know, is the master-apprentice model of teaching, in which young students learn directly from an adult who has mastered a particular discipline, and which has been with us since Plato at least. It is not a model limited to lecture and rote memorization, but it does place the teacher at the center of things, at least at the start--and why not? Parents, whether those of ancient Athens or modern America, pay for schools to have their children taught by adults, not by each other and not by themselves. It is progressives like you who polemicize the education debate, not traditionalists, because since Dewey you've been defining yourselves by what you're not as opposed to what you are: you're "new," not "old"; you're "learner-centered," not "teacher-centered"; you're "hands-on," not "text-oriented."   What you are, as far as I'm concerned, is part of a movement of fuzzy-wuzzy, anti-education, anti-intellectual sophists. If you honestly have the solution to our education woes, Alfie, then please, come down from the mountaintop. Take your book royalties and lucrative speaking fees and invest them in your own charter school, and show us myopic traditionalists how it ought to be done.  In short, put up or shut up 
 The first part of this 1997 edition covers material that is an "old hat". The rest of the topics are unnecessary, badly explained, too superficial, or unfocused. Don't waste your money, and your time 
 The publisher should be convinced that the automatic spell checker should not be so heavily relied upon.  The cover art is an expression of how an armchair graphic artist can be innovative with Photoshop.  If a book of such high esteem be put out for public enrichment its presentation should not be so insincere 
 I didn't like this book at all.  I couldn't even finish it.  It was too complicated and too many underlying characters 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 This movie is horrible. There is not a saving grace about it. Lucio Fulci is the worst of the Italian sub-genre directors and that is not saying much seeing as how the vast majority of Italian horror filmmakers seem to know only one language, violence... extreme violence.  The film opens up with a priest hanging himself in a town that I presume is in New England, and I live in New England, and trust me we do not all act the idiots in this film. Apparently the Italian image of New England is a bunch of inbred hicks.  Not back to the topic at hand. Apparently a hanged New England priest lets loose the last gate of Hell, how he does this is beyond me, but I am assured by the fifteen times that they say it.  A couple, which consist a reporter and a police officer, go up to investigate the occurance after a young women is buried alive (dead, but the undead... get it?) and talks about the strange inbred New England town. What happens next is all a blur to me. Something about zombies followed by insipid dialouge and then some more talk about zombies, followed by even more stupid dialouge, then a guy gets a drill in the head. Curtains.  While I am in the midst of trashing this movie I might as well bring up the zombies. These aren't your ordinary zombies, oh no, these are zombies that have the capabilites to transport from one place to another in a split second, whether or not this is intentional is beyond me. Another odd thing is, for some reason, they aren't interested in eating their victims. Rather, they enjoy pulling the backs of their heads off... you read that right, pulling the backs of their heads off. It is as weird as it sounds.  I don't remember how it ends (and I watched it only a half hour ago) and nor do I care. You will not care either. Not even a graduated gorehound like myself can enjoy this garbage. Do NOT watch this film. Ever. Sticking your money in your fireplace is better use of it then giving Lucio Fulci's estate anymore money. 
 I bought this product thinking that it was so pricey it just had to work. Well it doesn't. I followed the directions and went through two bottles with no results what so ever. I'm 24, 23 when I tried the product... no reason it should not have worked if it actually worked at all. If it doesn't work it should get 1 star because it is not delivering on its promise and the promise is why people buy this stuff. I wish I hadn't listened to the raves on this product 
 Fortunately I obtained this DVD from the library & didnt have to pay for it.  Very one sided.  Almost completely avoids discussing both sides.  Recomnmend instead, DA Vinci Codde Decoded,  Jesus, Mary & Da Vinci or Unlociking Da Vinci's Code.  Check Amazon reviews & rating on these other DVDs 
     I read a good short story by Franzen in The New Yorker a couple years ago, but this book is lame, lame, lame.  The essays contain little to no humor or insight- they are just lengthy, boring opinions on various subjects.  Imagine if you can a duller, less-relavant Andy Rooney.  If I wanted to read some loser's uninspired musings, I would get on the internet and start reading weblogs.  I hereby declare this book Unreadable 
 after being utterly discusted with this poor excuse of a study guide, i thought i would read some horrible reviews on the guide to make me feel better. to my dismay, people can't read and they only posted reviews for the text book, which is actually good but those reviews should be posted elsewhere.   You know there is something wrong with this guide when you see them call CH3-CH3 methane (pg 3 not to mention they got linoleic and linolenic mixed up) or on the multiple choice on page 19 has ribosomes as one of the right answers for proteins involved in transcription.  i have not done a lot of the questions in the book and all ready i see errors on every second page. i wonder if i will actually recieve lower grades if i study from this poorly written book.   I love study guides and have used them for stewert's calculus, campbell's biology and bruice's organic chemistry in college. were there some occasional mistakes... yes but overall they were good. this study manual however seems to have been written by a tribe of wild monkeys pounding on a keyboard. Save your 23 dollar 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 I bought this album after reading all the great reviews, having followed links from similar music. This is about as boring a disc as i've ever heard, and definitely doesn't meet my expectations for this genre. get Luxt's Chromasex Monkeydrive or something from Assemblage 23 instead 
 I received this book as a gift.  I was skeptical upon reading the praise for the book on the back cover from such political wonks as Bob Novak and Sean Hannity.  Haven't any well respected catholic theologians or scholars approved of this book?  No.  And with good reason.  It's not a history book, it's a poorly researched piece of garbage designed to bilk "the faithful" out of their hard-earned dollars.  I did read several chapters of the book to be fair.  When Crocker describes the Papal forces during the Albigensian crusade as "soldiers of God, overcoming all the odds to destroy the wicked oppression challenging the authority of the church."  I wanted to puke.  And how about the Inquisition, where Church authorities sanctioned physical torture against "heretics?"  Well, Crocker concedes that torturing someone might stray a little bit from Christ's original message of tolerance... but hey, they threatened the authority of the righteous Catholic church, so they got what they deserved.  Uh, yeah, amen brother.    These considerations aside, the book isn't even well researched, which immediately destroys its credibility with me.  For example from the Albigensian crusade, Crocker states that the armies of the heretics numbered over 100,000, yet with only a few thousand men, the Pope was able to defeat them, as they were filled with the "glory of god" or something like that.  Curiously, in his footnotes he cites nothing to back this claim up.  Maybe because it isn't true.  And any cites to books that have been critical of church policy, like, say, endorsing Mussolini, are derided as "unresearched," "politically motivated" and "shameful"  Ironically, that's exactly what "Triumph" is to me 
 VERY OLD STYLE BOOK, WITH ELEMENTARY INFORMATION GOOD ONLY FOR  TURIST 
 Being the fan of the Rolling Stones I picked up this CD thinking it was  something similar. Well they do try to emulate the stones sound but fail  miserably.  They have no originality or heart in their music who ever lets  them make CDs should be forced to listen to it.  If you buy this you are  either a masochist or an idiot 
 This book is not anywhere near the level of Bruce Bawer's While Europe Slept and Melanie Phillips' Londonistan, on the same general topic, the Islamization of Europe. Berlinski's writing is really a series of intermittently readable would-be magazine articles that, alas, were bound between book covers. In contrast to Bawer's book which skillfully ties each chapter to the Moslem problem in Europe, Berlinski fails to communicate with a unified voice and point of view. When she insisted at one point that she is definitely not saying most Moslems are disloyal, she lost me. Phillips wrote, on the contrary, that the evidence suggests most British Moslems support the terrorists. In the chapter on interfaith efforts by the mayor of Marseilles, Berlinski actually asks the mayor if his exclusion of an extremist imam from membership in the council is at odds with the spirit of the interfaith program. The mayor naturally took umbrage, and Berlinski failed to realize why her question was impertinent. She doesn't seem to know what she stands for, and neither does the reader. 
 I'm very disappointed in the video quality of this DVD. I'm not sure how it was filmed, but when dancers move across the stage, they're blurry, as if there's not enough frames per second in the film. When the camera is focused on the main dancers, the picture is OK, but any movement that travels across the stage is a mess. Even a dancer being lifted starts out in focus, then the face blurs as the dancer is lifted up, then is in focus again at the top of the lift. This DVD is unwatchable for me. I think this may have originally been a TV production and that's where the problem with quality arose. I have several ballet DVD's and this is the only one so far with this problem. 
 The "For Dummies" series is way over-done.  The original publisher made a lot of money and has moved on, and maybe so should you.  Like the vast majority of its siblings, Negotiating for Dummies is dry, poorly organized, poorly indexed, and just not funny.  If someone is really a dummy he'd expect a clear step-by-step guide, which this book is not.  .. 
 This book is not very good and it doesn't have any good baby names in it. It's lame. 
 This documentary is not one of John Grisham's best works. At times the book was hard to follow however he did make his point in the end. I think Grisham's talent is writing fiction and he should stick with that. 
 After reading the reviews and synopsis here on Amazon (which is the same as on the back of the DVD), I thought that this looked like it would be a very good movie with a promising plot.  Within the first fifteen minutes, however, it was not at all as I expected.  First, the summary stated that Anna Manni (a police investigator played by Asia Argento, daughter of the director and one of the only redeeming features of this movie) was hot on the trail of a serial killer/rapist and would be captured because of an attack of the Stendhal Syndrome.  This is misleading because this actually happens early on in the movie (before any of her tracking him down is shown).  In other words, if you are expecting to see a movie about a beautiful, strong-willed police detective that is trying to capture a serial killer, this is NOT the movie for you.  Instead it is [mostly] a journey into the mind of a greatly disturbed (possibly psychotic) rape victim.  The overall quality of this movie is also not nearly as great as it's director's reputation.  This is my first Dario Argento movie, and it is a grave disappointment.  After hearing of the "Argento Genius," I really expected a movie with great editing, dialogue and at least a decent horror movie style soundtrack.  This movie instead is the opposite on all counts.  Finally, the style presented leaves a lot to be desired.  It is basically a mashing together of sci-fi, horror, drama, and even romance that doesn't quite work (some parts are so outlandish I could not help but laugh).  In short, save your money for a worthier movie that does not follow a flawed script to begin with, and that is not an attempt at such "stylistic" filmmaking. 
 The Rocketeer is the cinematic version of all the faux-Deco buildings that have been erected in recent years around Los Angeles, particularly the Miracle Mile area. It's wafer-thin nostalgia masks a chintzy story that can't stand on its own two feet.  The plotting of The Rocketeer is sound enough for adolescent fare. Unfortunately, the characters are totally uninspired and the dialogue atrocious. Worse still is the execution of the material. Every actor is miscast and thoroughly lacking in charisma. Bill Campbell -- ever hear of him anymore? He overacts every single scene. Timothy Dalton? Hammy. Jennifer Connelly is the only one to come out unscathed.   The direction is beyond weak. When The Rocketeer appears at the nightclub it is so poorly staged, so cloyingly "goofy" that it extinguishes the promise of anything remotely thrilling from happening. Add to this foul mixture a horrendous James Horner score... you get the idea. Still, some nice set design and an effective animated film-within-a-film make for a couple high points. 
 Being a graduate student and living in an apartment, I was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments.  It prints off things quite well and it is fast.  It does not, however, print 500 pages per month.  50-100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over $20, which is high considering how often you need to buy them.  The item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition.  
 Of the over fifty books on leadership/coaching that I've read, this is by far the least useful.  There are anecdotes for basketball fans, but as far as useful ideas on success and leadership there are few.  It is the most useless book I've read in the coaching/leadership field (even worse than Coach K's or Dean Smith's). 
 I generally like David Sedaris; in fact he's one of my favorites. But when his stories veer off into the death of children, almost gratuitously, I can't see the humor. This is, please note, the first book of his that I haven't enjoyed. But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me 
 I clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here, who will all have to forgive me for thinking that Susan Cooper's "The Dark Is Rising" is plain awful. This book was recommended to Harry Potter fans who have run out of HP books to read. I must say it was a waste of my time to read "Dark."  Never have I read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero. In this case, we are told that on his 11th birthday, an English boy named Will Stanton discovers he is the last of "The Old Ones." Unlike JK Rowling who, in the first pages of Harry Potter & the Philosopher's (or Sorcerer's) Stone, provides the reader with a vivid description of Harry as skinny, with an unruly mop of black hair, startlingly green eyes, and, of course, a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Cooper does not describe Will Stanton at all. The result is that the reader, after having read 244 pages, still cannot visualize what Will looks like!!  I also find quite annoying Cooper's approach to this good vs. evil tale. She is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are The Old Ones, and who or what exactly is The Dark. As for The Dark being evil, all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that The Dark means cold, snow, and--of course--darkness. Excuse me: but is this the best Cooper can do?  Is this what this book is about?--the Druid pagan worldview of light vs. dark, summer vs. winter, warmth vs. cold? What happened to the conception of evil as MORAL evil? 
 This book was simply not up to Baldacci's usual quality.  The story goes all over the place, but doesn't get anywhere until the last 50 pages.  Even after 200, 300, and even 400 pages we are still chasing dead ends and no closer to figuring out where this thing is going.  I don't mind suspense, but you can stay "suspended" only so long until it becomes boredom.  The main character is the worst one Baldacci has ever created.  One minute she is crying her eyes out, and puking her guts out totally paralyzed by fear, and the next minute she is tracking down trained bad guys and saving the lives of the inept FBI agents and police.  This is repeated throughout the story.........I would think she had worn out all the emotional crap by the end of the book.  She makes one blunder after another resulting in the deaths of innocent people, but at the same time comes up with brilliant deductions that help her stay one step ahead of the mastermind killers.  By the end of the book I found myself pulling for the sadistic killer to finally finish this stupid [...] off.    This is one of those books to keep next to the bed in case you are having trouble sleeping. 
 Most people writing reviews for this DVD are focusing on the music and performances which I agree are great BUT unfortunately the DVD which I am reviewing was lousy. The editing was extremely ridiculous. You would be hard-pressed to find an instance of an image that lasted more than a second. It was more like 5 per second (OK that may be a slight--VERY SLIGHT-- exaggeration). This a trend in concert video editing that is evident here in the nth degree. Terrible! The images come at you like a machine gun. Please support this band by buying their CDs but unless you have the attention span of a 3-year old on speed skip this DVD 
 I have heard that Alice Walker is an incredible writer, which may be true (it is forgivable, since this was her first novel), but I found The Third Life of Grange Copeland to be extremely disappointing. First of all, I expected more quality in it -- this read like a soap opera story. This is why I shy away from best-sellers, but I thought Walker might be different. I can see her strengths in writing, but I do not even feel as if a vivid portrait of anything was painted. The characters, the home, the reasons behind many of the abrupt actions were all left unanswered. After putting up with that plot throughout the book, I expected a decent ending (I stuck it out). However, the ending was the worst part, as it came suddenly and then the novel was over. I still plan on reading other books by Alice Walker, but I would not recommend this one to anyone demanding a good plot 
 this book just reifies the old boy/girl dichotomy.  we have to move on from finger pointing to some real issues.  are we really to believe that boys are being harmed by feminism? poor things...  is there really anything inherent in being a boy or girl.  We know that there is not, so how can people still be making these passe and inflamatory arguments.  Give me a break.  
 This was the first Aishwarya Rai film I had seen after the English language version of Bride and Prejudice, so I was really looking forward to it. The music, dancing and costumes are lovely as is Ash as always.  I personally don't care for Shahrukh Khan, so when he played the total drunk, sad character in this film, it didn't help me like him any better. I am always frusterated with Indian custom of the girls father trying to pick the richest guy for his daughter, not caring about what kind of person he is or where her heart truly lies. Once again, this film followed that theme: that money and prestige are everything.  I hated the ending-this film was way too depressing for me, but the CD soundtrack is very nice as I own it and enjoy it 
 Don't become your own greatest fan, don't become a cake maker. Bakers like musicians depend on formulas to complete their works. Within the formula there is a certain area which can be explored so that new creations, having relation or similarity to the old, may bring forth fresh delight for existing and new fans. The new having resemblance to the old is almost necessary for a baker or musician to maintain it's customer base. With Evoke and the preceeding two :W: releases we expected chocolate chip cookies but found sugar cookies instead. Our taste buds sting with saccharine as we see far and forgotten are the days of Dried Blood, MFAST, and Mesner Tracks. These previous endevors had flavorful power. Evoke is little more than mushy paste. Where has our :W: gone?  EBM/Industrial music seem to be dying a protracted death of mediocrity. Perhaps Ogre was right in Skinny Puppy's song, "Ghostman", those following the footsteps really can't do it like SP did, but the joke is that SP can't do it anymore now either and they know it. I'm guessing Rudy knows he isn't able to carry the EBM banner any longer so he's really given up the ghost. I just wish it could end with dignity but it's quite the opposite. I am not bashing Rudy for trying something "different", I am calling him to task for not putting forth an effort comparable to his previous releases. This entire record seems rushed, poorly produced, and directionless.  Three shells of :W: records released within a short amount of time, Soylent soft drinks, :W: lighters, Polo shirts and lanyards. I'm expecting SPAM with a :W: branded onto the meat to come out next month. Merch is fine, that's where muscicians make their money, and I'd even like to own some of this insane crap, but it's just too much of an obvious money grab now. Rudy isn't making cakes for us or himself anymore, just his bank account. That is to say, as much as you can "cash in" on EBM, which isn't very much. Let it go or make something beautiful again Rudy.  Wumpscut is dead. Long live Wumpscut.  If you hunger for something loud yet thoughtful, give a listen to Numb. If you are up for a laugh starting a serious thought in your life, look to Laibach. If you don't care about the depth of lyrical content, and let's be honest - you wouldn't be here if you did - give a listen to Hocico, Combichrist, or Punto Omega.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Rudy's next release, but I'm not keeping my hopes up. : 
 I've heard good things about this book so I was honestly expecting to like it.  However I really was disappointed and surprised because after the third chapter the book gets boring and very repetitive.  And because it was written by Brooke Shields, the book sold.  But really, if an unknown wrote this book it would not have gone anywhere.  I also got the feeling that because Brooke Shields suffered PPD, she thought it is was so almighty important that she needed to write a book about it.  I'm sorry but I don't think that a person who goes through depression for only a few months has suffered all that much.  There are unfortunately millions of people who are poor, without health insurance, and worse without support of family and friends, that keep their depression going on for years and years and their entire lives are destroyed by this illness.  No one cares about them.  That is the saddest fact about depression in this country.    However Brooke Shields had millions of dollars to pay for help, a famous name that allowed her to write a book all about it, a career that people would die for (her lack of talent doesn't seem to have affected her career much), and most importantly a husband and friends to help her out.  She also had a doctor calling her every day which I've never heard of before!  Try being without all those things when you're suffering depression.  Trying to beat depression without love and resources is like trying to drive a nail into a board with a feather.  I was a bit annoyed that Brooke Shields was oblivious to all this in her book.  And Tom Cruise only brought more attention to the book with his rant about medications.  I admire Tom Cruise - he is certainly far more talented than Brooke and I believe his comments about her career angered her more than anything.  However he is not a doctor and he does not know what he is talking about!!!!  The book's writing is very mediocre and the people who buy the book live under very different circumstances than the author, so it's hard to get much out of it.  This book only sold because it was about Brooke Shields 
 This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American  children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I  only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is  obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who  enjoy such material will like the book more than I 
 $aban uses the words Character, Loyalty & Commitment throughout this book...Obviously this is a clear case of, "Do as I say, NOT as I Do". Mr. Webster define's Hypocrite as, "one who pretends to be pious, virtuous, etc. without really being so"...How many time will they change the color of his shirt on this book's cover 
 The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.  There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.  Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.  The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.  In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day. 
 Perhaps I just misunderstood.  But this book just wasn't what I thought it was.  I was really excited when I ordered this book.  I just couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  I wanted to see how things were done, what materials I'd have to buy (and hopefully where I could find them) and generally find out how to make this magic happend...  But no such luck.  I actually don't quite understand this book - and it really doesn't contain any text to misunderstand.  It does contain a lot of nice pictures (and I mean a lot), even though some of the ideas displayed should perhaps rather have been made of plastic and varnish, glue and gypsum for people out of this world (really, some of the things displayed are really really ugly!).  Some of the ideas don't have anything to do with anything real.  These are glossy patios suitable for I don't know whom.  But perhaps that really doesn't matter - at least if the book is just intended to be a good idea bank for different groups of people.  But I found no warning signs on Amazon.  I don't like to slaughter things, but then again I never review things as I'm doing now without having a very strong point in either direction, i.e. positive or negative...  Sadly, this book had a negative impact on me, period!  You make the math:  The book has no functionality (other than ideas) for the DIY person. The book is in fact just a big "Ikea brochure" - a lot of pictures, but little or no text. Which brings me to the last point:  The little text that actually is to be found is often wrong (typical copy-and-paste (or find-and-replace) Word failures) like "Courtesy of Courtesy of Action Concrete Services".  For any serious publisher, one failure as this one should have been enough, but this particular blunder can be found evenly distributed over the entire book!  Sorry, I just can't live with that, especially since the book is in fact nothing else than what Google would have given me with a few keystrokes.  So:  If you don't have Google, buy this book!  That's my advice.  Or, if you do have Google but want a glossy paper book with a lot of pictures in it, you might still want to buy it.  Just don't expect any help with anything other than how to contact a contractor 
 I bought this game on the fly cause the cover illustration looked so interesting that I couldn't resist. The instructions were a little confusing to understand at first, but once gameplay started it was picked up pretty easy and much fun was enjoyed by everyone. The game is geared for those ages 10 and up, but it was so easy to understand and so much fun, that my 8 year old neice was able to play without teaming up with an adult. The game promotes math skills which is a HUGE plus since many games today are only about fun. This game has it all, fun, education and the artwork on the cards is fantastic. When we played, we threw in chocolate gold pieces so we'd have real pirate plunder and everyone had to speak like a pirate. It's a really great way to spend quality time with your family and it's fun for all ages 
 I tried not to give it any stars, which is what it deserves.  I have a difficult time understanding why Mr. Eastwood continues to write the soundtrack to the films he's involved in.  There are composers like Harry Gregson-Williams, Elliot Goldenthal, James Newton Howard, David Julyan, Mark Isham, etc... that can create something meaningful and 10 times more advanced than what "Dirty Harry" can create.  Would the director and executives of another major motion picture accept a soundtrack of this quality?    I hated Mystic River's soundtrack as well.  I think he got lucky with Million Dollar Baby.  Not much music that might have ruined the acting, and no inspirational music when she is winning all the fights, unlike the Rocky movies.    I am very aware that he doesn't posess the education, training, and experience that all of the major Hollywood composers do.  But he should stick to acting and directing.  He has proven himself to be very good at both of those with the awards he has recieved in his lifetime.  I think he is just trying to show off at how much he can contribute to a movie.  And his "music" is nothing noteworthy at all, in my opinion.     While his attempt to write another score is surprising, it leaves so much to be desired in a film like Flags of Our Fathers.  It's a tremendous film, with an interesting story, great characters, great acting, and authentic battle scenes, much like Saving Private Ryan (John Williams).  They have a meaningful well-made film ready for a composer to add thier ideas and talents to, and make a great movie-going experience.  And then we get the same boring nursery rhyme style melody and chord progression over and over and over again.  And then on top of that, it's rudementally orchestrated between guitar, piano, and trumpet with those long droning strings.  Granted, not much to work with for Lennie Niehaus who orchestrated it.    I got so sick of it on just one viewing only.  And the scene when the son is looking at the pictures and the medal, as stupidly simple as that melody is, I think it's completely intrusive in that scene.  It ruined a moment that could have been very moving with anything different musically, or maybe no music at all.  I believe everyone has a job when making a movie, and when one person is doing too much, the quality suffers.  And that's if Clint Eastwood was an educated composer, which he isn't.  No one can deny that, not even him.  As I mentioned before there are so many composers out there that could have made that film even more moving and powerful.  I think that the executives looked the other way and let something like this happen because of a big name like Clint Eastwood.  Film music is an evolving art form constantly struggling to get the recognition it deserves.  And with good moives being made that are horribly scored in this way, it's not helping the film music world at all.  It is admirable for someone to try new things and contribute in ways not thought of before.  But when they don't have any talent, they shouldn't be allowed to do it.  I am an aspiring film composer taking classes, going to movies, and buying soundtracks to learn as much as I can about it.  It gives me a moment of pause when decisions like this are being made about major films.  I know it's just Clint Eastwood attempting this, but what if more actors and/or non-composers try doing it?    Please, no more soundtracks Mr. Eastwood!  You do what you are good at and leave the music to the established, experienced, and well-known composers of Hollywood.  Bryan Arata              
 It gave me format errors out of the box..  I returned it to Tiger Direct for an exchange and got a refund instead. Not to happy about paying all the shipping costs for nothing 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 I remember years ago hearing people say how Grant Morrison saved and revitalized the JLA. As a matter of fact I still hear people say this. Some consider his JLA stories to be groundbreaking epics of altered consciousness painted on a grand scale. His work on JLA was a very popular in terms of sales and fan reaction. But I have to ask am I the only one who finds this more than a little puzzling? I have now read all six JLA trades comprising Morrison's run on the title and I don't see what all the praise is about. I will grant that his use of the White Martians at the start of his run was an interesting idea but it didn't amount to much in the end. And that I see as a consistent trait with his JLA work. He seems to insist on working on a huge canvas when from what I can tell he is not much beyond paint by numbers. His stories are choppy and inconsistent leaving the reader wondering what's going on from moment to moment. In his stories he plays with our perceptions of dimension, time and consciousness with often little regard to characterization. I think he is more concerned with creating some grand catastrophe for his characters to battle than he is in making the story actually work for the reader.  This trade which reprints JLA 34-41 concerns the formation of a new Injustice Gang and the imminent threat of a 15 billion year old galaxy destroying doomsday weapon called Mageddon. This is yet another Grant Morrison tale that goes through the motions of giving you lots of action but very little story. We are told that this Mageddon is an unstoppable doomsday weapon that causes those of an evil nature to wage war against those of a good nature until all are corrupted by its influence. But before the JLA can face Mageddon they have to deal with the Injustice Gang. After bypassing the JLA's security measures the Injustice Gang decimates the Watchtower leaving the team in disarray.   Now this brings us to the character of Prometheus. Morrison has described this character he created as "the anti-Batman." As we all know Batman trained himself to be a weapon against crime after seeing his parents killed by a criminal. Prometheus trained himself to be a weapon against law after seeing his criminal parents killed by the police. He created a helmet that feeds the skills and abilities of others he keeps stored on compact discs directly into his central nervous system. He confronts Oracle in her clock tower and offers to use his technology to restore her legs if she will betray the JLA. When she refuses he knocks her through the face of the clock leaving her hanging on to one of the clock hands. When we see Oracle again next issue she is safe and sound back in her wheelchair inside the clock tower but we never find out how this happened. I guess this happened in one of the Batman related books. It would have been nice if Morrison had made some mention of how she survived since she had no way to call for help.   Despite having no weapons available Oracle somehow managed to damage Prometheus' helmet when he attacked her. During a previous fight the JLA had with Prometheus Batman had captured one of his helmets and ran tests on it to find out how it worked. When he returns to get his spare helmet he knocks out Huntress and is then confronted by Batman. During their fight Batman pulls out a device that rewrites the information on his disc leaving him helpless. Why would Batman even bother to fight him if he didn't have to? This doesn't sound like the master strategist Batman is supposed to be.  I would have given this trade a one star review if not for the Spectre story in issue 35. It concerns Hal Jordan trying to find a way to balance his role as The Spectre against his humanity. It's an interesting story that shows some members of the JLA could be open to judgement by the Spectre. J.M DeMatteis wrote this story.   Having now read Morrison's work on JLA I'm not inclined to try anything else of his. If over reaching convoluted stories are your idea of good comics you may just like Grant Morrison's JLA. But if you prefer your comics have great stories and well written characters I suggest you buy Kurt Busiek's Avengers stories or his creator owned work in Astro City. You'll be glad you did. 
 Although the book has great illustrations, it just doesn't give much information.  Yes, the author discusses the sharpening of virtually every cutting instrument, but usually only using a certain jig that you probably don't have.  There is little depth to this book; it's like a vast ocean that is only an inch deep.  The book is a better review of sharpening tools and jigs on the market than it is about sharpening, and if you have these tools, you don't need the book to tell you how to use them.    I would have liked to see in-depth sharpening information- what a tool that is sharp looks like and how to get it there with basic tools.  The book rarely achieves this.  
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 Up to now I haven't received the product that you've sent me for the second time.  Zuleid 
 I feel compelled to add my review, as I bought this CD based on what I'd read here...  what a disappointment.  Tedious, predictable, unimaginative "electro-pop".  There's SO much more interesting stuff out there, and I listen to alot. I found this CD remarkably disposable. No offense.. 
 Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!  Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 This product had been given to me to help me relax.  I suffer from an anxiety disorder and the chiropractor said it is good for it.  DO NOT TAKE this if that is the case.  It made me sick as a dog.  I went to my doctor and he prescribed me medicine that is for people like me who has anxiety attacks.  I was then made aware that Herbel Remedies can make anxiety worse and not better.  Always check with a doctor before taking this 
 Maybe my expectaions were too high. It's hard to beat an album like Dr. Octagynocologist and Dr. Doom. This album has sick beats and 50% of the songs are about urinating on people. Check out the Deltron 3030 and skip this one 
 Had a huge crush on Deven when I was little.  Silly little movie with very little plot.  But Brought back found memories.  
 More self absorbed swill!! 
 I love Ford harrison movies and this is not a bad story but the film is shot in such dark showdy lighthing by the cinematographer that it is unwatchable that it ruins the film and all the acting, directing and writing in it. 
 The DocuPen holds, at a maximum, 10 pages.  When I called customer service about this, I was told that the unit's capacity was being exceeded because I was scanning "high resolution images."  Photos?  No.  Pictures?  No.  I was scanning printed pages from books.  Apparently the DocuPen can only hold around 10 pages of normal text.  The 50 page limit described in their advertising apparently refers to pages with a sentence or 2 on them, rather than actual pages in books or journals--very odd considering it's touted as a tool for students.  A complete waste of time and money.  I returned it and now I'm back to using the photocopier.  Don't bother with this one, it's not at all what they claim 
 I really thought these were the cutest bumper pads, but after hearing over and over again how you shouldn't use bumper pads because of risk of suffication, I decided it wouldn't be worth the risk to put them on the crib.  I don't think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one, and even if there were I wouldn't be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them.  She has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these.  Again, cute for the nursery set up pre-baby, but I wouldn't use afterwards 
 Most professional historians at least try to feign objectivity in their treatment of historical figures.  Harry Kelsey does not.  The author despises Drake and makes no attempt to hide that fact.  Kelsey set out to do a hatchet job and he certainly wasn't going to let history get in the way.    Although the author does a reasonable job of addressing many of the established historical events, he deliberately fails to report dozens of well documented incidents of Drake's mercy and largesse.  While Drake's Spanish contemporaries were torturing or executing the Englishmen they captured, Drake repeatedly spared his captives' lives, fed and treated them well, then eventually released them unharmed.  These accounts are well documented BY DRAKE'S CONTEMPORARY SPANISH ENEMIES, yet Kelsey cannot bring himself to report these incidents.    Why?  Harry Kelsey loathes Drake and cannot force himself to simply objectively report the positive things that Drake's own enemies said about him.   More objective treatments of Drake include  1. "Francis Drake" by John Cummings  2. "The Secret Voyage of Sir Francis Drake" by Samuel Bawlf  3. Passing treatment of Drake in "The Queen's Slave Trader" (biography of John Hawkins) by Nick Hazlewood  Even Kelsey's own more recent (2003) work "Sir John Hawkins -- Queen Elizabeth's Slave Trader" treats Drake (albeit incidentally) more evenhandedly than his "Sir Francis Drake:  The Queen's Pirate" 
 I've purchased several of these bras in the past from Qvc as their ad states and was surprised to see it so cheap here. Though I was suspicious, I ordered one anyway. Not surprisingly, the cups puckered when I tried it on. Never had this problem with any ordered from QVC. When I inquired about returning it, I was disappointed to find they have a no return policy (though not posted anywhere I could find easily).   I believe this company sells '2nds' though does not advertise that fact.  I will not purchase from this company again, and I am now leery about purchasing through Amazon in general 
 Amazing how a writer can attempt to make an immoral organization, the corporation, look moral. Only someone like Al Capone could sympathize with this group on the Oregon. How can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the Oregon. The US apparently is willing to finance the group, but the US also financed Sadam, Noriega, ... Unfortunately, in this sense it is too much like real American policy, which absolutely disgusts me (the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind, as long as they are not righteous Americans). The characters are clichï¿½, there is no suspense since everything goes as planned, and anyone in the crew can just about do anything, including being a successful rock band. It makes me look back on the Dirk Pitt books and wonder about Dirk's morality 
 Ahhhh, what a great movie.  I cry at the end every time.  I remember when I was young and prayed for the safe return of the astronauts of Apollo 13.  However, I am SEVERELY dissappointed with the widescreen DVD.  Those who created it did not use the original film, but chopped top and bottom from the fullscreen VHS version.  There are many instances when this is evident, but the most glaring is the scene in the back yard of the Lovell house after the walk on the moon when Jim says, "I want to go back there".  When the scene opens, he is cut off at mid-thigh and you never see below his knees. On the fullscreen VHS you can see his shoes.  When I buy the widescreen, I want the WHOLE movie, not less than the fullscreen VHS tape.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  Buy the VHS 
 I should have listened to Yael's review... dead on.  Nothing special about this book.  I'll be donating it to the library 
 my other management textbooks were able to cover nearly the same amount of information in 1/4 the space without being needlessly complex or as paralizingly boring. it would be an excellent cure for insomnia. professors PLEASE don't make anyone buy this thing. 
 I have seen this movie several times over the years and it never fails to delight me 
 This critically acclaimed set of short stories from Junot Diaz is at best a childish diary that was put together by incompetent editors desperate to publish anything that sounds remotely different from the monumental garbage that they continously publish every year.  The writer's main preoccupation seems to be channeling his anger about his absentee, unfaithful father and the effects on his mother in the Dominican Republic. This would be fine if it didn't read like some troubled child's diary. The writer repeatedly throws in spanish slang and sayings which I felt were used just to prove to his readers that he's bilingual as they add absolutely nothing to the plot or story, not there's any in any of the stories anyway.  The stories end abruptly, they're worst than mediocre, and he doesn't use quotations to separate his terrible dialouge. The reviews for the book were excellent but that should be expected from unqualified writers such as Junot Diaz. Critics only praise books that deal with tormented souls who use their depravity to channel it into elementary and generic prose. One must be aware that the writer is an MFA in literature, which just proves how lackluster American Higher Education has become. A terrible read 
 I am a HUGE Laymon fan and it pains me to give anything bearing his name one star. But in the midst of all the gaudy sex (which comprises the bulk of the novel), and the tiresome use of "Christ" as a swear on every page, I found I kept asking myself if Laymon had even written this book. This is not one of his better novels in my opinion. It's not scary, it's not creepy, it's just vulgar. The mummy plot was a good one, but there were too many other plots mixed in which watered it down, and by the end of the novel I didn't care anymore. There were new characters being introduced and killed off too far into the book (like chapter 45). All of the sub-plots (if we may call them that) tied together in the end rather messily and, for me, didn't make much sense. I had no idea what any of those people really had to do with the mummy at all. Those extra plots could've been taken out of To Wake the Dead and made into separate novels - that would've been better. I love Richard Laymon's writing, but I had to force myself to finish this book, I hate to say. If you want prime Laymon check out Madman Stan from Cemetery Dance Publications (cemeterydance.com), or, for prime Laymon at a cheaper price check out In the Dark or Blood Games. Anything before this book will do. 
 This is a little far fetched but bare with, a London born Actress transplants herself to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap...and then writes about a London born Actress being transplanted  to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap. Got it? Personally this psuedo semiautobiographical novel about Hughes life (or lack there of) is testament that some actors should remain just that! The cynical nature in which her character sees Los Angles and the people surrounding her is way too close to accurate for this to be classified as true "fiction" and the parallels between her main "villain" Meredith Contini and a certain fabulous legendary New York Based All My Children icon is so blatant it borders on insulting. Her work on General Hospital was good, Her work on All My Children was tolerable, at best, but her work as a writer makes me ashamed to admit Finola Hughes is a fellow Brit. 
 IMO, this is a terrible book for beginners.  The structure is non-linear; within the first few pages the author references more advanced Photoshop techniques as if the reader understands what he's referring to.  Frankly, I'm surprised the "for Dummies" group ever published the book.  If you're new to Photoshop, this book will almost certainly confuse & frustrate.   It simply is not a text that "Dummies" (read beginners) will get much out of.  I read the first 3 chapters, and I still had no understanding of Photoshop's basic features.   Perhaps it will be a good reference book as I become more adept at Photoshop, but I wanted a book that would teach me the basics.     I've found both the "Photoshop CS2 for Beginners" DVD and "Adobe Photoshop CS2 Classroom in a Book" to be far superior choices for Photoshop novices.  If I could rate this book a zero rather than a one, I would.      
 Having read reviews prior to purchasing the book, I thought, it can't be that bad. I was wrong. All of the reviews are accurate and true descriptions of the book. I purchased the book as required text for a graduate introductory course in data communications. What can you do if you're stuck with this book and you must read it " for class"? Read the summary at the end of each chapter FIRST. This might help you grasp what the author is trying to say in a long, extended, technical and scientific way.   The book includes scientific descriptions of data communication. Perhaps the book is extremely on point for engineering students or someone with interest in creating a data communications or telecommunications system from scratch for an organization. However, addressing the issues from a business perspective is not the primary focus of the book. Reading the chapter demands utmost concentration and the ability to extract key concepts about the subject under discussion. It is not clear why this book seems to pop up so often as the required text.  There are many books that address data communications from a business perspective. It is an arcane academic selection as required text for a non-engineering data communications course.     
 I wanted to see a romantic and touching movie.  This movie is contrived. The character that Reeve plays acts like a star-struck groupie.  Personally, I don't find his behavior to be romantic.  He seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him.  This is not romantic to most women nowadays.  He is not suave in the role he is playing.  It seems like a cheesy 70's contrived romance that does a bad job of it 
 This book is puzzling. It's a contorted read that breathes platitude after platitude, but does more to demonstrate how to write obscurely than with clarity. At first, I thought the book was a satire, deliberatly using ambiguity, the absence of punctuation, and the lack of clarity to make its points. But, that's clearly not the case. The authors seriously believe they are about making "truth" clearer, but then fail to make a single argument to support any of its propositions. This is one of the worst books on style and clarity I've seen. Not only is it superficial, but its grammatical and syntactical mistakes are glaring. Do the authors know anything of punctuation? IF they do, they don't show it 
 The "filler" songs on this CD are some of the worst I've ever heard. The lyrics sound like they were written by sixth-graders and the music has no character. I thought I was getting something similar to the unique, gritty sound of The Cranberries, but alas, this is closer to Hilary Duff. Aside from "Rebel Heart" (which is one of my favorite songs ever), I can hardly tell they have any Celtic connection at all! 
 Both my wife and I have high blood pressure, which our doctor would like us to track at home. After checking out many brands and styles of automatic monitors, and based on the reviews here, I didn't hesitate to buy the Mark of Fitness, Inc monitor (Prevention edition).  When I received it, there were two problems: First, there was no owner's manual inside. Since I kept getting an "err 2" message, I had no way of checking what that meant. (Amazon.com suggested I look online for a pdf version somewhere. Unfortunately, the Mark of Fitness' web site didn't have online manuals.)  The second and more important problem with this product was that it was clearly very inaccurate.  When I finally was able to get some readings, they were: 112/64, 106/60, 96/61, 106/62, 109/64, and 115/62.  Oh, how I wish some of those WERE my readings!  Maybe it was just my misfortune to get that one in 500 lemons with no owner's manual and who knows what else wrong with it, but unfortunately, I won't take a chance on trying another one.  It's going back today 
 This monograph documents the firms finest projects over the last 35 years  in microsized barely readable format.  The work is beautiful but the book  is absurdly small.  It's an example of the new 50% sized architectural  monographs aimed at architects who look at images and do not care to read  micro text. Many of the postage stamp sized photographs are not legible.   Why  include 1"x1" photographs? Why are 2 important buildings on  the front and back covers mislabeled?  Gwathmey Siegel are fine architects  doing high profile projects that are aesthetic and functional.  This book  is aesthetic without being functional. I am amazed that  an established,  leader of the architectural profession allowed such impressive work to be  published in such a poorly designed book.  This book confirms the worst  fears about our profession: architects care about aesthetics at the expense  of function 
 This book was a bit dissapointing, really. You think a book of this size and price would at least include more and better information, and many of my desired majors it had absolutely no information on. Totally was not worth it 
 In today's rap market the hot commodities are the albums that have the most materialism, disrespect to women, and "gangsta fairytales". Well Shawnna's album has all of the above and her sales are poor. So what does that say for Shawnna. She can't even sell in a market that caters to commercial BS!!!!!! This album is garbage, Shawnna is chi-town garbage and needs to find a new occupation. I suggest her finding either the nearest strip club (since she is from the chi I suggest Arnie's in Harvey!) or find the nearest porn studio for a more productive career 
 Hmm, quite a disappointment, especially after splurging on the hardcover edition.  Set as a kind of "Rockies Rear Window," this is one slow story.  Endless pages of crazy-making when I'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through.  Finally skipped ahead to finish the book.  I had really looked forward to Angels Fall, too :(  If you are a Roberts fan, don't spend the money on the hardcover, wait for the paperback, go to the library, or borrow from a friend.  Not worth the price. 
 You know how you sometimes go to those action movies ("guy flicks") and from the moment you sit back in your seat until the closing credits 90 minutes later, you are assaulted by car chase after car chase, explosion after explosion, and you have no idea where to look first or what's really going on? That is how I felt reading "Club Dead."   I consider myself a fairly intelligent person, but I seriously had no clue where the plot line was -- or if there even was one. Yes, there was a ton of action, but it was enough for three or four books instead of just one. And the motivations about what was going on was never really explained.   A lot happened in this book, but I'm not really sure what it was -- or why it occurred. Too bad, as I really enjoy the characters, and Harris has a great way with words.  
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 This purported economist cherry picks his stats (a common historical comparison of his hodgepodge of stats would provide greater credence) in order to substantiate his position that Americans are infected with a consumption fever.  Although his overall contention about the increased consumption of "luxury goods" is true, his patent moralizing discredits what should otherwise be his nonbiased academic standing and casts doubts about his recommendations.  What is even more offensive is his implicit assumption that Americans are weak & stupid because of things such as the proliferation of credit cards "causes" them to spend beyond their means.  This assumption is akin to overweight Americans blaming McDonald's for their obesity.   This book is for you if you believe that government officials (i.e. Big Brother) should be the arbiters of your behavior and that the individual is never to blame or to take the consequences of his/her actions. I recommend reading "Living It Up" by Twitchell instead. 
 I love all the other Little Bear books in her series but this one was strange.  I'm sure that 30 years ago it wouldn't have seemed odd to tell your child a story about kisses being passed from one person to another but in today's age it just left a strange feeling with me esp at the part where the skunks kept kissing eachother back & forth.  At least they get married at the end of the story.  I took it back to the libray.  Glad I didn't buy it.  I own all the others she wrote however and love them 
 While the book is amusing, I highly doubt it is based on fact. I am not arguing the entire book to be false, but I did research (ended up doing a paper on it for one of my college classes in fact) on the so-called real Ten Commandments.  Technically, Kick is correct. The "Ritual Commandments" he listed are labeled in the Bible as the Ten Commandments. However, if he had read any other part of the Bible he would have seen that this was the second list given to Moses; the first one being the "Ethical Commandments" which we are all familiar with. Both of these lists, among several other decrees, were equally important to the people. Whenever referring back to the commandments, the ethical ones are always used. Plus, for Christians anyway, after Jesus all of the old laws were abolished. The Ethical Commandments were summed up in two laws: Love God and only God, and Love your neighbor as yourself. It only took me 10 minutes to read part of Exodus and see he was twisting the truth. If he can get such an easily researchable topic wrong, then how am I to have faith in anything else he says 
 The reason I can never fully like this album is because of what it created in it's wake, the "float on" kids. I've been listening to modest mouse since when they began and I am disappointed going to a show and having a thousand kids scream at the top of their lungs for that song. If you listen to any of their other stuff, you will realize that it sounds nothing like original modest and they have made their first "mass produced" superhit. The album has it's moments with "blame it on the tetons" and "the world at large" but "dance hall" and "satin in a coffin" bring it down. If you enjoyed listening to modest mouse before this cd came out, don't buy it. You will be disappointed 
 I remember this movie back in the 70's as being much, much funnier. I bought it. I saw it and I will never watch it again. It is in the give away pil 
 The item didn't work at all.  As a matter of fact.  My dog didn't even flinch when I tested it right next to her head.  No, she's not deaf either.  We yell for her to stop barking from across the house and she hears that fine.  The item actually melted in the sun (it still worked though).  I was going to return it but it said it had to be in good condition and it was all warped from the sun - oh well - lesson learned.  I'm not trying to sound bitter but don't waste your money on this item.  I'm gonna try the shock collar next.  Maybe I'll have better luck.  Thanks anyways,  Mik 
 In his magnum opus, 1984, George Orwell famously wrote,  "Who controls the past, controls the future and who controls the present controls the past". This is a lesson that Jared Diamond has obviously learned well.  In his latest book "Collapse" Jared Diamond" continues to push the Europhobic liberal agenda. Hiding behind the facade of environmentalism Diamond crafts a sub-text that calls for Europeans to embrace the values of failed third-world cultures and abandon the pursuit of technological advancement that has created global European cultural hegemony. Unfortunately for Diamond, genuine scientific research is revealing much of his work to be based on nothing more than wishful thinking and an overactive imagination.  Diamond makes the assertion that Easter Island experienced a cultural collapse due to depletion of natural resources and overpopulation. This may conflate well with the tenets of liberalism but unfortunately for Mr Diamond, it does not conflate well with the factual findings of the latest archaeological investigations. Radiocarbon dating of soil samples, by Carl Lipo and Terry Hunt, indicate that Easter Island was not inhabited until two to eight hundred years after the occupation time that Diamond's theory would require. Quite simply, the new evidence uncovered by Lipo and Hunt indicates that the period of human habitation of Easter Island was far too short for Diamond's putative collapse to have been the result of overpopulation. To quote Carl Lipo,   "It fits our 21st century view of us as ecological monsters. There's no doubt that we do terrible things ecologically, but we're passing that on to the past, which may not have been actually the case, to stick our plight on to them is unfair"  It is difficult to over-emphasise just how badly compromised Diamond is by this evidence. The Easter Island chapter is a major plank in his argument, the fact that Diamond is rank ignorant of the latest archeological research reveals him to be an amateur polemicist rather than a scientific authority figure.  Those who may think that Diamond's Easter Island fantasy is simply an abberation might want to introduce some hard science into their analysis of Diamond's version of the history of Greenland. The extinction of Greenland's Viking colony is used by Diamond to enforce the ideology of modern liberalism. Diamond claims that the Vikings perished because a racist contempt for the Inuit prevented them from assimilating ideas that would have prevented their slow starvation. A cultural superiority complex caused the Viking colonists to cling to an unviable agricultural lifestyle and, in Diamonds words, "The Greenland colonists starved to death surrounded by oceans teeming with fish". This is an analysis that neatly dovetails with modern pro-immigrant, liberal cultural relativism and the dogma of multiculturalism. The major flaw in Diamond's argument is that the latest historical research shows that by the time of the colony's extinction the Greenland Vikings had, in point of fact, switched from a diet that was 80% farm food to a diet that was 80% marine food.  In otherwords, the Viking colonists proved to be perfectly capable of adapting to environmental change without having to learn lessons from stone age primitives. To present the Vikings as beloning to a soley agrarian culture in the first place would be the cause for much derisive laughter among genuine historians. The Vikings are well known (unless you are Diamond) to have exploited a rich variety of marine life as a food resource.   The alternative explanation for the Vikings demise is that the mini-ice age that caused the Vikings to switch diets also witnessed a mass immigration of Alaskan Inuit who competed with the Vikings for food and finally massacred them in an unrecorded genocide. We know about the mini ice-age from the evidence of core samples and tree rings. We know about the Innuit peregrinations through archeology and folk record. In the face of genuine science and history I'm afraid Mr Diamond is left up a certain creek without means of conveyance. Historians tend not to write about evolutionary biology, perhaps evolutionary biologists might in future restrain their urge to embarrass themselves by writing about history?  
 I was not into this movie at all.  My mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through.  A middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life, so he takes a dance class.  Ofcourse there's a fine dance instructor, a crush is pursued, a wife gets jealous, hires a detective, and *gasp* his crush is found out.  The movie was too predictable and it just wasn't for me.  Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea.  Richard Gere was cute as usual, which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end, besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since "So You Think You Can Dance" never had contestants who mastered it 
 An appalling book. Boring, poorly written, poorly edited.  Try Algorithm design manual by  Steven S. Skiena or  Thomas H. Cormen's Introduction to Algorithms or Kleinberg and  Tardos' Algorithm Design or the excellent Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms by Anany V. Levitin  instead of this mish-mash 
 it's a fan only! NOT a heater!!! 
 I was shocked to discover that according to Gittleman I am supposed to exist on 4 - 6 oz of protein a day! Is she kidding with this? If you actually adopted her eating guides you might survive, but you would wish you were dead. Save your money, this is an extremely restrictive diet! Very unrealistic! 
 I have to agree with many of the other reviewers about how repetitious this book is.  After every page I turned it felt as if the author was just saying the same thing over and over again without ever coming to any kind of conclusion.  I was amazed at how someone could babble on for 200-some odd pages without actually saying anything.  The whole time I was reading the book I just felt like it wasn't really going anywhere and I felt as if right around the next page I was going to find some conclusion that would tie everything together and make some kind of sense of it all, but there never was such a page.  Being quite a pessimist myself, I really wanted to like this book but I really didn't and so I don't recommend this book 
 i did a fast skimming through this book and noticed that for an Essential Monster Movie Guide, it certainly doesn't praise or hype the genre that well. this book comes across like it was written by an elitist who's too good for horror. nearly every movie/special gets a low rating and i can't understand why a book like this that could've been a good companion to the horror fan would be so anti-horror as a whole. horror fans, in general, want to be be entertained and or scared...i for one don't want logical stories and things that make sense IF it detracts from the entertainment factor because typically what makes sense and uses logic in horror is BORING. it gets 2 stars from me because it offers a diverse selection of films and includes mini biographies of horror legends like Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Lon Chaney, Boris Karloff, etc. But for a horror movie book, the writers certainly didn't help their genre by bad-mouthing it so much in this book 
 Disappointing, but I read until the end and then laughed at myself for doing so. If you are reading this review to decide whether or not to read this book next - my recommendation is grab another book from your stacks.  The storyline is more fantasy (silly) with a splash of romance than thriller. It is unfortunate because the storyline could have been solid with a bit more focus and character development.   So many books and so little time - pass on this one unless you have a need to read every book Stephen Frey puts his name to.  Two ½ stars. 
 How can one man be endowed with such knowledge, how to cure every single disease known!!! How do you do it? What is the secret to your genius!?!  Please, the world is dying to know---Wait, I think there's a cure for that on page 87...  
 This translation, one of the Barnes and Noble "Classics Editions", is the 1874 English translation by Edward Roth, a Philadelphia school-teacher. In no sense a translation, it is more a parody or retelling of the French original with many embelishments and additions by the author. The editor is Aaron Parett, an English professor from Montana. In an appendix the editor mentions that for furthur reading one might try the complete translation by Walter James Miller, "The Annotated Jules Verne: From the Earth to the Moon" published by Crowell: 1978 and reprinted by Gramercy: 1995.

 MaryJanice, STOP WITH THE IRONIC* QUIRKS!  It's cute once or twice, but it's just not working anymore.  Not only is Fred allergic to shellfish, she's unable to swim unless she's in mermaid form.  Jonas appears flamingly gay, but he's really straight and likes being spanked.  And the male leads.  *sigh*  I've never before found two male leads so completely boring.  This book left a lot of questions for me.  Answers to those questions could have made this book much more interesting.  Like say... 1.  How did Fred manage with blue/green hair in elementary school?  And all through life?  Hasn't some hairdresser noticed yet?  Why wasn't the story of a blue haired girl picked up by the National Enquirer?     2.  Is Fred a virgin?  It goes on an on about how she hasn't had a date in 6 years and has bad luck dating.  Has she no libido?  Why doesn't she have at least a marginally interesting romantic history? 3.  How can a marginally intelligent marine biologist not have ever considered her own biology? 4.  Why does there have to be this whole undersea world with a hierarchy and everything in the very first book?  Why not Fred, a lone mermaid, feeling isolated, lashing out, coming across a stranded, ill merman who has lost his memory or something?  Why does the very first book have to introduce this entire hidden society?  Why not lay the character groundwork first?  I find the Queen Betsy books a bit trying because Betsy is, well, almost mentally retarded at times.  She's not charmingly self-absorbed; she's just dumb.  And the werewolf stories, I thought those had real potential.  Still do, but the Rachel Ray fanwanking has to go.  Her recipes are vile.    *I mean Alanis Morrissette Irony not O. Henry Irony.  
 Clavell is often ranked among the greatest writers of the last quarter of the twentieth-century, and I am not at all sure he belongs there. I've read several of his books and while I loved Shogun, ALL his novels had:   A) The same recurring themes and in a few cases literally the same storylines (and even the same sentences) recycled for re-use....   B) The same frustrating lack of a definite ending...   C) A habit of carrying the "Asia good/Europe bad" tone a little too far.   Clavell here dishes up a looooong, slow as a melting glacier, story of westerners in 1860's Japan, all of whom are trying to better themselves with economic or political opportunities in this newly-opened Asian kingdom. The French, the Americans, and the British are all in competition for control of the island, as are a number of cut-throat international corporations. Gai-Jin (a rude Japanese term for a person of foreign birth, roughly equal to such western slurs as "WOP" "Spic" or "Mic") is simultaneously the story of internal strife in a Japan in transition from the age of the samurai to the era of industrialization: and ultimately global ambitions.   Clavell introduces generally well-conceived characters but there isn't much of a story to move them through. As is so often the case with this man, there is a constant sense that "wow, something big is going to happen soon in this novel" and then upon reaching what passes for an ending, discovering that despite your long-held hopes, nothing ever does happen.   When I completed this demanding, often far-fetched novel, I cannot say I had regrets for having read it, but I do remember a strong sense of letdown. For those interested in saving themselves roughly a hundred hours of reading time but getting the same story in return, watch Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai, which is set in the same time and place as Gai-Jin, and deals with roughly the same themes and issues 
 Over half of this movie consists of scenes taken  from the original 1939 classic film directed by Zoltan Korda. Even those scenes can't disguise the remake's network TV-movie quality. Beau Bridges is generally a good actor,  but he is terribly miscast on this film. Go rent both versions of The Four  Feathers and see it for yourself 
   I purchased both of Annie Duke's DVDs. The information is valuable but as a No Limit player,  I found the discussion of both Limit and No Limit distracting.   My BIGGEST COMPLAINT is that the setting is identical to a funeral home, including the crimson velvet curtains framing an urn. Ms. Duke wears the same ugly shirt throughout both videos.   I would really enjoy these DVD's if they were produced in a visually appealing setting, and if Ms. Duke changed her peasant blouse. It is unfortunate that so much good information is wasted by poor production.  
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 First of all, in this book Monique said that she weighs 220lbs.  I dont think so.  Maybe at one time she did, in high school.  I dont think she was really being real in this book for some reason.  I read the first chapter and maybe 2 pages into the next chapter but couldnt get any futher.  Instead I looked at the black and white pictures she had through out the book.  Being as I dont have anything to read at this monment I might pick the book up and try to read it again in one of my totally bored moments.  Other than that, I really expected more out of this book.  Glad I borrowed it from my sister instead of buying it.  Better luck next time Monique 
  I usually trust Amazon reviewers on movie reviews, but this time ....NO WAY!   This silly, totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment, hoping the movie would liven up.  Sadly, it didn't. To those who rave about the film...you must be in another dimension or something.  Thumbs DOWN. 
 Lightweight, simplistic treatment of investing in apartment buildings. If you're serious about this subject, other books on Amazon are a better bet. 
 Not a very good book on any level. Not horrific, but overall really lame. A whodunit that you could never predict, because there was nothing to predict. It's like the author wrote the book and then when it came time to publish it, chose a character at random that 'did it' and wrote the last 10 pages. So save yourself some time, read the last few pages and make up your own adventure 
     I can't remember when I was more angry at the ending of a book.  When I finished THE GRAVE MAURICE I swore that I would never read another Martha Grimes book, and so far I haven't.  I admit I miss Richard Jury and Melrose Plant as I would any other old friends, but I am tired of endings that feel like a kick in the stomach!  So, no more Martha.  I will find new friends elsewhere 
 While there are many books that provide us with beautiful and harsh truths about our culture, this novel is not one of them. A chaotically written story that bounces around the life of the central character, combined with weak character development and far too many adjectives in every sentence, make this the worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read. The book is wholly depressing and utterly incomprehensible and Ana Castillo is the lazy man's Sandra Cisneros 
 I generally like and admire Faulkner's work, but this novel (or whatever it is) got the better of me.  Usually I make myself finish any book I read no matter how difficult, but with "A Fable" I simply couldn't do  it (and I've managed the entirety of James Joyce's "Ulysses" and  Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past".)  I may have a Master's  Degree in English, but I still had great trouble following what was going  on in the book, much less appreciating what it was trying to say.  It's  amazing to me that the Pulitzer Prize committee could even manage to get  through this thing, much less give it an award.  I haven't given up on  Faulkner, but for the first time since I was a college undergraduate, I've  given up on a book.  It took "A Fable" to bring me to my knees 
 Simply put, this book is terrible.  It's advertised as "hard sci fi" but the ideas, not even to mention the story or characters, just aren't there.  The characters are all paper cutouts and the storyline drags very badly.  I kept checking the page number and thinking, "Is it possible I've read this many pages and still feel like the interesting part hasn't started yet?"  Worst of all, the "hard sci fi" consists of a Jovian gas-based society (which has been done much better by other authors) and nanotech machines, the Wheelers, which they simply *skip* actually describing in detail in the book!  By the end I felt scammed by the marketing of this book.  If you are looking for hard sci fi, do yourself a favor and buy anything by Vernor Vinge, Ian Banks, Greg Egan, or any of the many other authors writing much better works in this genre 
 After many years, I decided to finally give Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan series a go.  So, where better to start than her debut novel 'Deja Dead' which introduces Reichs' heroine.  Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist working in Montreal for what I'm guessing is the French-Canadian equivalent of a Medical Examiner's office.  Of course our heroine is head strong, independent, and unlucky in love (aren't they all?).  Well, some murders start turning up and, amazingly enough, our intrepid anthropologist is the only person that links the crimes together.  Do the police believe her?  No, so she must investigate the crimes on her own.  And by doing so, the murderer then turns his attention to Brennan and her family and friends (don't all killers eventually do that?).  First off, the book is bloated.  The book (at least the paperback version) clocks in at about 530 pages.  Reichs' writes too much about menial tasks that her character, Brennan, does during her usual day.  Does anyone really want to hear repeatedly about what a character had for dinner or what paperwork she does at work?  I know I don't want to read it.  Now I'm a person who enjoys a nice, long book but 'Deja Dead' (where did she get that title anyway?) is about two hundred pages too long.  And it is a very slow read.    Secondly, her main character, Brennan, just isn't likeable.  In fact, I found her quite annoying.  The policemen in the novel are portrayed as incompetent, arrogant jerks who are too worried about being right than they are about doing the right thing.  When in fact I think that they just didn't want to deal with this overly nosy anthropologist who is obviously stepping on toes and irritating people who are just trying to do their jobs.  Reichs' tries to portray Brennan as a lone crusader fighting against all these odds to get to the criminal.  When in fact she is an irritating anthropologist who has no business investigating a murder.  She is, basically, a laboratory-based employee who should not be in the field.  So I don't blame the cops in the book that don't like her.  She's butting her nose in where it doesn't belong and, in a part I actually liked, she ends up bringing irreparable damage to her family and friends.  I thought it a just outcome.  Also, after about the twentieth time of Brennan looking at some cop's rear end and saying "I like the way his butt looks...Oh, stop!  You need to get laid." I wanted to scream.  Dr. Brennan, at least in this debut novel, is extremely irritating.  Thirdly, I have read the basic plot of this book in a hundred other novels.  The suprise "switcheroo" ending is not suprising but more annoying...  It is just a cheap way to trick the reader.  And if I have to read about one more main character who ends up becoming the target of the "killer", I will scream.  Its pathetic.  How many times does it need to be written?  Its ridiculous.  Now, 'Deja Dead' is the first of Reichs' books that I've read.  I've heard that the following books in the Brennan series are better and I certainly hope this is the case.  I really didn't like the book:  not the characters, the plot, the writing...  But I will give Reichs another try and read the next book in the series.  If its as bad as 'Deja Dead', I don't think I ever read another one her books 
 Lethargic but prescient novel about dull, spoiled American leisure class brats in trouble: a blueprint for the Reagan Irrevolution & the Bush-Clinton wastrels & wastrelettes 
 Generally, didactic novels are rather tired and trite, offering platitudes that only please a particular group, while alienating all others.  This book avoids much of that by telling a mildly entertaining (if meandering and redundant) tale set in a (somewhat overly) detailed future.  However, it fails because this book suffers from the "a moral in search of a plot" syndrome.  The original Canticle was a masterpiece because it offered no easy answers and deftly explored the tensions that came with a life of faith.  This new work knows the truth from the beginning, and its entire purpose is to destroy the basis of the previous novel:  The Catholic church is evil, and organized religion is the bane of civilization.    Whereas Miller's first novel dealt with the church as a more or less (but not always) positive force, this book clearly knows the Catholic church is an evil, evil thing.  This, of course, represents the loss of faith Miller suffered later in life, but he let this disillusionment take over the narrative so that the plot becomes submerged by numerous diatribes and examples meant to reveal the utter corruptness of the church hierarchy.  This is fine if you agree with that stance.  But if you don't (and I am not a Catholic) or even think that novels should stimulate thinking rather than preach to you, then the tale becomes rather annoying.   
 Any positive review of  this book is probably by someone trying to sell it to you. 
 Paulo Coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and I wonder why, commercialism?  Good read, but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book, contradictions over. I am waiting for his next novel that will re-institute him as the best ...  Alas don't buy this book, borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time, better entertainment watching Carnaval or Rome on HBO 
 If you're considering this book, you're probably like me- concerned about the continuation of societal complexity in the face of fiscal irresponsibility and the end of cheap oil.  You probably want to find that perfect place to buy cheap land, produce your own food, and in the event of calamity, escape the hungry hordes.  You're probably hoping this book will help you find that place. Trust me: it won't.  This book provides a stage for Joel Skousen to drone on and on about his conspiracy theories (Russian communists have gone underground and are preparing to nuke us!) and crackpot and racist ideas.  One could probably have gleaned at least a little information from the maps, but they are of such poor quality as to be almost useless.  Don't waste the money 
 After listening to this, I would not recommend it to the casual listener.  A very odd and certainly different vocal selections.  Still not one of my favorite singers 
     Two stars for the version. I was heartened to see that this was a two-disc edition, as I figured it meant both the original version and the less-effective director's cut would be available. Alas, there is just a completely different movie on the second disc, and the headlining film is the lesser version. If you want to see this movie properly, with Delphine Seyrig's sung theme song, and tighter, more effective editing (why do we always suppose that meddling is an improvement?), you're going to have to get on EBay and find the original VHS, with the big, oversized box (not to be confused with the VHS of the original release of the director's cut). [NOTE: according to the comment below, the longer version came first, not second, as I had thought, so make of that what you will, although that hardly changes my opinion of the two versions.] It won't be DVD, and it won't be widescreen, but it will be worth it. When I first saw the director's cut, I was surprised by how saggy it made the film (and the dropping of that theme song is criminal). What a disappointment that the second DVD release of this film has not remedied the error, or at least given us both versions.      By the way--what is with giving an "unhelpful" review to reviews that don't recommend something, regardless of whether they have been helpful or not? It's kind of weird. I don't care if my review is tagged as unhelpful, esp if you actually think it is, but if you read a review and it doesn't say what you wanted it to say, that is not "unhelpful," it is "something you disagree with," and there is no rating system for that. 
 I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.  Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.  With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.   Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.   At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.   I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.   I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.   The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.   We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.   Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling. 
 I didn't have high expectations for this movie, yet it still managed to completely disappoint me.  I adore Robin Williams, and his performance was the best part of the movie.  But the script was abysmal and Sara, played by Marcia Gay Harden, was a completely one dimensional character.  The antics of the sidekick robot and the "flubber" itself were just plain embarrasing to watch.  Too bad, because the idea is great - but frankly, the original was pretty bad too. They really could have done so much with this story either the first OR the second time around 
 The concept was great. But after only a month or so, flaws started showing. The inserts started bending and warping, seperating at the edges and cracking. I purchased them for my Mother who gave them to my Daughter as a gift. She loved the idea, but will go back to the wooden boards because I don't think these will be around long. And they were not cheap either 
 Having first seen the movie, I was prepared that this was not a starry-eyed wholesale endorsement of high school football, but I was still thrilled when my wife surprised me with a copy to read.  I have never been so dissapointed with a book on football, or all of sports for that matter. I enjoyed Next Man Up and A Civil War, due to Feinstein's balance between negative and positive lights on the game. Bissinger, in Friday Night Lights, shows no such balance. He does not "follow the season" in any logical fashion, sometimes skipping entire games, and spends a chapter instead focusing on national politics. Honestly, you'll see the name of Michael Dukakis more than you will the name of Permian's starting quarterback.  I love football, I love high school athletics, and found this book to be very annoying. Check it out in a library before you spend your dollars on it 
 I didn't like it.  I own Ultra Chilled 01 and 02, and really dig them both...but this one really isn't my style at all - didn't like any of the sounds I heard. Thought it would have been as good or better than 1 and 2, but it wasn't.   
 AC/DC is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time, but they are not growing as musicians. Sure, they can rock like they used too, but they seem to be out of ideas. The well is dry. Put out a anthology already!!! At least my favorite band Deep Purple keep coming up with good stuff, and with imagination! The fact that Purple's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber.   Anyway, better luck next time Angus & Co.  Stiff Upper Lip ~ AC/DC : 2 stars  
 I concur with my fellow reviewers that this Casebook contains more typos and grammaticla errors than a first-grader's book-report!!  If your Torts prof is excellent (and mine was) such editorial problems won't keep you from getting a good grade.  But, to be sure, buy the Examples and Explanations by Glannon and a good commercial outline to supplement this POOR casebook!  Finally, I wholeheartedly agree with one of the reviewers who indicated that this casebook is VERY much biased towards the plaintiff's bar and against defendents, businesses, or "the MAN" 
 This is a very basic, thinly-written guide for restaurant workers. A good part of the book seems to be spent identifying who does what in a restaurant; definitely not for anyone who has ever worked in an upscale restaurant. There are also plenty of cute illustrations to help drive the authors' points home to the reader; they were somewhat unnecessary and actually gave me the feeling of being something of a fluff tactic and an effort to fill up space. The book would certainly benefit those who had never worked in a restaurant or had only served/hosted/bartended/bussed in a more casual place. Do not buy this book if you have ever owned a crumber 
 I am one of the Vietnam veterans referred to on page 217, the ones that didn't agree with anything the VVAW had to say.Someone wrote in their revue " the myth of civilian disrespect to the soldiers during this period of time", I would have to say it felt quite real to me. The only reason I checked this book out of my local library was to confirm a couple of things about John Kerry and the VVAW. All my questions were answered either by the book or by a recent interview with Gerald Nicosia. The first was that the other members of VVAW felt that John Kerry was just using the organization to gain public notoriety to help him with his political career. The second was that he was at the november 1971 meeting. This is when the anti war VVAW considered assassination of pro war Senators. Simply amazing 
 I was just called to a new client site last week that has 11 of these cameras installed. Of the 11, half at any given time will drop off the network and/or lock up. He was continually calling his exiting tech guy who performed the install to reset them and eventually called me in because he wasn't getting in his own words "what he paid for".  I've used netstumlber and a few other apps to verify the wireless network health, which in my opinion is very good. At the farthest point, I am still receiving 92% signal with a non-enhanced Linksys router. Other devices on his network are problem free; the issues are isolated to the cameras.  Short of recommending the client box them and send them back for a refund, I've emailed DLink for any opinions or aftermarket "fixes". They are running the latest firmware. I've tried to pick a few up on E-Bay to at least test them in a controlled environment, but spending $400 per camera when there are obvious problems would not be something I would be willing to invest in. It would be something I would be interested in since if they do work as promised, I could recommend them to future clients.  My credentials, ex-NYPD officer and instructor, CCNP/CCDP CISSP, have a 10+ year networking business serving major Brokerage houses in Manhattan and have a smaller business auditing networks, recommending network security, and wireless solutions.  I will follow-up if Dlink provides an actual solution. AIM is my username above if anyone has jumped this hurdle 
 I started this book because I love the quote about writing being but a different word for conversation.  Yes, there are moments of great wit.  However, they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a Little Golden Book.  It's not the sublime non-linearity of Joyce's writing or Ornette Coleman's playing.  It's the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree.  Certainly a unique achievement, I guess.  But so is Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music.&quot 
 As mentioned by many reviewers, this book has a lot of preaching about the invalidity of the concept of races.  What interests me to the book was the title "Mapping Human History".  10% of this book content is in this area, and if those content are condensed into a short paper, it'd make really good reading.  The whole book is a quick read. The key "mapping" can be summarized as follows: 1. "Out of Africa" hypothesis (sole source of modern homo sapiens is from Africa) is affirmed by genetic research. 2. First wave out of Africa (~65,000 years ago) is by sea along Arabian peninsula to Indian Ocean which has two streams afterwards, one earlier stream down Oceania and a later stream up East Asia.  3. "Mongoloid" characteristics are formed relatively late (~20,000 years ago? I don't recall anymore) 4. Second wave is through Sinai peninsula by land ~45,000 years ago and completely displaced Neaderthals in Middle East & Europe by around ~30,000 years ago 5. First wave and second wave met in (north) Central Asia from different directions 6. Primarily the East Asia stream entered the Americas ~15,000 years ago (but could be earlier), though some genes from the ME/Europe stream have also entered (because of 5.) 7. All these really happenned before the invention of agriculture (and culture).  Agriculture (and potentially other key technologies such as use of iron) privileges the groups who are the first to under-go population explosion.  A lot of racial mixing especially on the fringes afterwards.  This is where Jared Diamond's "Guns, Germs and Steel" picked up.  If you're just interested in the mapping, you don't need to buy the book-- save it for something else.     
 I have most of EJD's books and I was definitely not impressed with this one. It actually took me a little over a week to finish it which is unheard of with me and my beloved EJD books. I'm just not feeling this one but I still buy the hardcover out of loyalty and because a bad EJD book is better than a whole lot of other garbage out there that's disguised as "good" fiction.   EJD chose to write a plot involving scams, murder and suspense like he did with "Thieves Paradise," wish was not my favorite either. The main character Driver gets caught up with married lover Lisa. She is a psycho to the tenth power. Reading about how she kept up with Driver's every move just made me shudder to think how easy it is for a person to stalk you if they choose.   I like that the backdrop is Los Angeles. Although EJD is not originally from Los Angeles, he's lived there long enough to have effortlessly captured in his novels the love-hate relationship you can easily develop for this city. You can't really describe it, you just have to live there to understand and appreciate his descriptions. I do like the appearance of characters from his previous books such as Arizona, Pam, and Panther. I'll admit Rufus was funny for words. The twists and turns of the story was okay but when it came to the end of the story I couldn't care less what happen just as long I was done.     The good news is that I am ready for another dose of EJD. The man is a great author who really takes the time to write books that the majority of black people can relate to in one way or another. Like I said earlier suspense novels are fine but I'm hoping the next one goes back to his roots and deals with relationships. 
 The book should have been titled " I have my cake and eat it too! A CD's guide to enablement and manipulation"  As a married CD in a committed relationship of 17 years. I was astonished on how self-absorbed and manipulative Dr. Novic came through in his "memoir." As a life-long admirer of the feminine, I do not perceive that he (and I mean "he") has an understanding of the feminine power that is within us all. He seems purely absorbed in obtaining sexual gratification. Which is fine, I just do not hold him as a positive representative of our closet community.  I also have dealt with mixing cross-dressing and the family. I am blessed with a supportive, open-minded wife who challenges me to be a better person and understands we possess both masculine and feminine in our psyche. To meet this challenge and keep my cross-dressing as a positive in our family, I have learned to cook, sew, do my equal share of housework, listen, nurture, care for our children and elderly relatives -- in essence, experience first-hand what a woman's role is. I am richer because of it. I still enjoy the sensuality of silks, wonderful garments and make-up, but we strive for balance and finding the "right place and the right time."  If you are a married CD, be careful about showing this book to your wife. My wife read it first and gave me the icy stare, "is this what you really want." I hadn't read it yet, so I had some bridge mending to do as I was guilty by association.   In summary, I did not increase my knowledge on the subject of cross-dressing nor did I see much of myself to relate this story. To me, Dr. Novic's memoir reads as an entitled, self-absorbed CD who has found a way to get it all and blame anyone (1st wife, parents, counselors) who got in his way. 
 The book is interesting, and well written. It contains little unique or scarcely known or understood information. Novice runners might like it and get more from it than experienced runners. 
    All this is iis a bunch of 1:00 long songs that are all crap. They should have put This Might Be A Wiki or at least Boss of Me on here. But, unfortunately, it's a FLOP! FLOP! FLOP! Useless noise!      LOCAL CRAZY MONKE 
 Talal Asad describes his book as an attempt to give an anthropological reading of the meaning and history of the 'secular', especially as it relates to modern Western thinking. What he does in practice, however, is muse on the various interpretations people in present and past have given to the term, make some random observations about religious practices, and delve into subjects only tangentially related to secularism (like human rights) or not at all (like the 'meaning of pain').  The book misses any greater 'storyline' or reasoning, making each chapter seem a separate essay, and not one very clearly connected to the one before at that. Now this would not be such a problem if the chapters themselves were insightful enough to cause the reader to view secularism or the importance of it in a new light. But unfortunately, this is not the case either. I don't know whether it's the anthropological way of analysing things or whether he is just too modest: but either way, he absolutely avoids making any judgement or even a conclusion, instead preferring to spend endless paragraphs pondering the genealogy of words and concepts. Every time it seems matters might get interesting, every time Asad seems to make the connection to current events or political theory, he seems to rebuff his own interest in the subject; invariably any mentioning of a moral judgement or a political analysis will be followed by "but I'm not interested in whether this is true or not, but only in showing that people have looked at it in this way".   It may be that I myself are simply too uninterested in cultural anthropology to find that exciting, but either way the whole book failed at even holding my passive interest at any point. The subject might have been a very useful and interesting analysis, and clearly Asad is intelligent enough to make one. But more's the pity that he apparently feels such an analysis is beyond the pale, making the book pointless and contentless 
 This book repeatedly emphasizes that germs are mean and that they are everywhere and that their sole purpose is to GET YOU. Very scary, actually. It puts them in your body, in your food, in the air and the miminally addressed topic of keeping yourself clean does not banish them. The next page just puts them all back somewhere else. It is not clear at all that handwashing, not letting other people sneeze on you, washing the floor, not leaving food overnight on the counter are effective ways to keep healthier. The emphasis is on a ton of very cute cartoony germs in multitudes. The health aspects are implied only--and poorly at that. Behaviors like nose-picking are RIDICULED. Not good for kids up to about age 10, especially if you're trying to teach health and cleanliness issues 
 Do not expect this book to shed any light on the culture and people of Hong Kong...  I bought this book because the stories were set in my hometown, despite the fact that I usually do not like short stories. I was quite disappointed mostly because the Chinese people depicted in those stories seem more alien to me than anything else. They were definitely not the everyday Hong Kong people one would meet. I felt that the the writer was still trying to portray Hong Kong as a mysterious place when it is definitely not.   The writing is not bad, but the contents and plots left much to be desired 
 This book lacked a lot of focus in what it wanted to accomplish.  Was it trying to give tips on how to win at Monopoly or trying to show how the game teaches lessons to be applied to real life?  In both cases, it came up lacking.  The tips it gave were rather common-sensical, the stories it shared didn't really give any insight into how the game applies to business, and to top it off, it didn't not give accurate rules to the game.  For example, the book said that you couldn't collect rent while in jail, so you should always try to stay out of jail and in the game, just like in life.  That's a nice maxim to live by, but you CAN collect rent while in jail and every good business person knows that there are times to be aggressive and times to be conservative.  Overall, the book was very disappointing and I hope only to spare others from making the same mistake of wasting time reading it 
 We have only had this showerhead for one month.  Already the nozzles are clogging.  The spray has become more like pins and needles than a gentle waterfall.  Do NOT purchase this product if you have hard water 
 Having read and seen more than my fair share of Holocaust-related books and films, I was hoping for some provocative, or at least thought-provoking, analysis here. Instead, I was treated to a superficial and incomplete overview. From start to finish, Cole's contention is that in literary and cinematographic works the Holocaust has been packaged to supply consumers with a "happy ending", and that in endeavours such as museums the full horror is deliberately (although the reader is left in some doubt as to how consciously) blanked out or softened.   In fact, many survivors have pointed out that the full horror can never be known, as even their own experience could only be partial. Another fact is that all the first-hand accounts, however gruesome, have been given by survivors, which does tend to leave an impression of the Holocaust as something which could be (and in fact was) survived, if only by a minority. It is a pity that Cole did not take a closer look at the abundant literature describing the damage wreaked on survivors and their families, for instance Art Spiegelman's depiction of his parents, Lily Brett's of her mother, or Charlotte Delbo's wrenching account of the individual lives of her fellow deportees before, during and after their imprisonment in Auschwitz.  There are also occurrences of sloppy thinking. For instance, Cole has accomplished the tour de force of simultaneously criticising the early presentation of Anne Frank for "stripping her of her sexuality" and drawing a veil over her appalling death. Actually, that early presentation was almost exclusively based on the first published version of the Diary, which made no secret of Anne's romance with Peter (sexual enough to cause her parents serious concern), and surely it is not common for diarists to record their own demise, least of all in a death camp?  Finally, there are a number of careless errors not acceptable in a scholarly work. The recurrent misspelling of "Birkeneau" is especially irritating in view of Cole's credentials, "the girl in the red coat" of "Schindler's List", whom Cole dismisses as a "myth" incorporated by Spielberg into his film, does in fact appear in Keneally's book under the name "Red Genia", and the Jews in the "Train of Life" do not escape to freedom - the last scene shows the narrator in prisoner's garb, possibly German, possibly Soviet, behind barbed wire, leaving it unclear whether the train story was a fantasy or whether the Gulag ultimately caught up with the escaped Jews.  In a word, disappointing 
 This is a moderately well-spun book about the "No Spin Zone." Should be called the "Know Spin Zone" since really nothing in it is objective.  O'Reilly is a case-study in the typesubjective journalism that is prevalent in the media these days and the book shows this.  In other words it's a must read for everyone with the ability to see through it.  If you can't see through O'Reilly's bias then this book is poison 
 When I got this book I was expecting some good advice. But what I found was a bunch of ridiculous crap. She suggests that all meat eaters are "blocked vegetarians" ... they really want to be vegetarians but they have fears. Give me a break, she couldn't be more wrong. The book does not offer practical advice and just adds to the idea that vegetarians are weird people. Trying telling a meat eater you think they are a blocked vegetarian and see the roars that will get you. This author offers a fantasy world, it's not based on reality. Plus she starts the book out with bumper stickers and saying about vegetarians... like vegetarians don't also have bumper stickers and saying about meat eating? Please! She portrays us as victims of meat eaters, and misses the idea that groups like PETA are out there making vegetarians look like complete idiots. If you want to read this book I would suggest you get it used or at the library, it's not worth buying. It's good for a laugh only. "Blocked vegetarians"... LOL! Give me a break 
 I bought these socks to wear for work.  They didn't even last one day.  By the end of the first day, there was a hole in one of the socks at my heal.  By the end of the week both socks had quarter sized holes at the heels.  I bought three pairs so I tossed out the first pair.  The next week I put on a new pair of socks, and once again by the end of the day there was a quarter sized hole in one of the heels.    
 One year it's: Eat every 3 hours. The next year it's: Eat every 5 to 6 hours. I WILL try taking antioxidants before I go walking in the morning. Frankly, I get so sick of all this diet stuff--everyone wants to get rich on their brilliant ideas. The "elephant in the room" is: Eat less, exercise more. Period. If that doesn't work, eat even less, exercise even more. Sorry, I'm not going to waste any more money on diet books 
 This book is just another 'low fat/high carb is the way to go' and a vegetarian diet is the best for everyone piece of junk. The authors have little nutritional knowledge and, at one point, advise a vegetable fast for diabetics! Very poor quality book and I advise you to avoid it 
 I ordered this book and realized the day after I placed the order that my boyfriend had bought it for himself. When I emailed the seller to see if it was too late to cancel my order and the reason I got no response. I sent another email 2 days later and I still never received a response. I then got the book (which I'm stuck with) and not even in good condition! BAD EXPERIENCE 
 When will MTV learn? and when will anyone ever come to reality? Who in the world told this child that she could sing? She can't! Yes I agree totally with someone on this review the girl is just as nasally as I am when my sinusis are backed up. My cat can sing better then that...  Heck why not let me do a reality show you don't have to know how to sing all you need is just a pretty face. And that sums her up in a shampoo bottle.  She's young, pretty, petite, and talentless.  I say CAN Cheyenne! 
 I have had this book for about a year and needless to say, I am not even on page 100.  Every time I have tried to read this book, it seems like I am reading about the authors experiences, rather than the experiences she has had with her daughter. It got so boring that I have to put it down.  Every time I pick it up, I forgot what was going on in the pages before. On a recent family trip in the car, I brought this book with me, with yet again, another attempt to TRY to read it and give it yet, another chance.  After only reading a few pages, I said to my husband and daughter, "No matter how I try, I can't read this book!"  The author has taught me nothing about my tween, almost 12 years old.  I only read about HER (the author's) feelings and experiences about herself growing up and things that are happening with her, which hardly touched on the experiences she was having with her daughter or the interactions she has had with her daughter or any conflicts, hard times or happy times she has had with her daughter.  In my opinion, save your money or try to get it from the library.  I thought I was going to read a book about my tween in training, but the best training is going through the daily grinds and figuring it out yourself. There is no better training than to be with your own girl and her friends and being a part of their lives and trying to come down to their level, singing, being silly, and sitting on the floor eating popcorn with them.  Sorry 
 I found the recipes in this book to be simple and bland. I am actually in the process of returning the book.  Anyone who cooks can come up with combinations better than this.  
 I no longer have this book, so I can't comment on the details, but it was the main text of a class that I took at UC Santa Barbara.  I was very excited about the class, which was an amalgamation of two of my favorite disciplines: music and physics.  Well, the class and the text were both disappointing, and I dropped the class.  What I remember of the book is that it seemed rather dull, and it tended towards older ways of thinking about music, particularly in regards to the psychology of pitch (consonance = happy! dissonance = disturbed!).   It did not seem like a real scholarly work to me.  And I have to agree with a previous reviewer that the computer music section was totally out-of-date 
 To be fair to this book, I must admit I have not read the entire book in detail...though the reason is that I found the book unreadable. I borrowed the book from the library, as I was reading a number of texts dealing with  the philisophical implications of quantum physics, but was dismayed to find  this book is a hodge-podge of 19th century physics and 20th century  'new-age-rhetoric'.  Perhaps an exerpt from the section dealing with  colours will give a clue to the writing style:     Red is the male force.   This color is represented by C and C#.  The male force is expansive,  energetic, doing, building, expressive.  Red is the color given Adam, the  first materialized Man.  This is the beginning point of material  manifestation.  Energy always manifests in a triangular fashion, i.e., a  single source manifesting in a dual nature or way.  Hence from this  position the next color to be manifest is Blue or the female color.  This  has been eternally symbolized as Eve taken from the twelfth rib of Adam 
 "Sling" is a misnomer for this gimmick...think "tourniquet" and you'll be closer to the reality.   There are several buttons and eyes on the "sling" to adjust the fit.  I tried every configuration, and they all felt too tight.  A snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put, but my experience was the same as that of other reviewers:  the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around.   Despite the problems with the strap, I like the briefs.  My recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap.  The sling technology needs more R&D before it's ready for the Big time 
 It has been over a month and I have YET to receive my movie!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Both of the recipes I tried were total flops.  I made the Savory Scraps on p. 55.  It is supposed to produce 9 squares from an 8 X 8 pan, but the result was a crumbly, non-cuttable mixture that I had to stir into the dog food.  The other recipe, Mutther's Day Puppy Seed Bread on p. 64 turned out burned on the edges, raw in the center, and unedible for my dog.  I pride myself in being a good cook who can follow a recipe.  I think they failed to verify their ingredient lists for these 2 recipes.  I hesitate to try any more of the recipes.  Perhaps they didn't verify the ingredient list.  My dog likes the food and the notations in the cookbook are very cute, but I think the customer should expect the recipes to turn out.    
 Asko Parpola has been hawking his theory of the Indus script for close to  three decades. As new evidence comes in counter to his claims, he shifts  his theory accordingly but without abandoning the framework as should have  been done long ago. Paropla's analysis of the Indus script as well as the  Vedic texts is very flawed. He is surprisingly not aware of key  information. For example, he sees the Gilgamesh motif of the Harappan art  as having been borrowed from the Mesopotaminas, but the same motif occurs  in the much earlier rock art of Central India. According to the  archaeologists, there is a continuity in the Indian culture during  8000-1000 BC; Parpola ignores this to assert his immigration hypothesis 
 Professor Jenkins has written with insight and clarity on a number of controversial topics, unfortunately, while this book raises some important points, it is rather tendentious compared to his past works. At one point, he claims that the Clinton Administration's Health Security Initiative failed to make it into law because of the Administration's petty aversion to having the Catholic Church as an ally. This strange assertion will come as news to many, including Theda Skocpol, author of the most comprehensive study on the failure of the Clinton health care proposal. Elsewhere, Professor Jenkins explores the pedigree of anti-Catholic prejudice in America in depth, but he fails to do the same for Vatican hostility to the United States which has a long pedigree of its own. Despite the good feelings towards the Catholic Church in the United States at independence (due in part to French aid against the British) and the disestablishment of Protestant churches, the Vatican regarded the U.S. "as the bastard brat of Jacobinism" (to quote Samuel Eliot Morison) and warned against the heresy of "Americanism". This hostility persisted right up until the papacy of John XXIII. Also, during the 19th century, the Vatican made no bones about its opposition to freedom of religion, freedom of thought, and freedom of conscience. This hostility persisted right up until the Second Vatican Council. Unfortunately, while none of the Vatican II reforms have been formally rescinded during the papacy of John Paul II, they now seem to be as much a dead letter as the splendid list of rights embalmed in the old Soviet constitution.   Nevertheless, it is deplorable that Roman Catholics have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in actions this book indisputably documents. Such treatment deserves condemnation wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others that endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. But the proper reaction to outrages committed against Catholics should not be to claim that all who take a critical view of the church are motivated by prejudice. There is an immense and inordinate effort by the Vatican in some countries (e.g., Poland, Italy, the United States) to manipulate civil-statutes and to have its doctrines written into the secular law. Even when the Vatican's efforts may seriously threaten the lives and well being of a large number of people, (as in attempts to hamstring public health efforts against sexually transmitted disease) its advocates remain undeterred and refuse to consider the magnitude of the risks involved. Although the authoritarian inclination of the Church is not a crime, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered towards clericalism; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective threat to a democratic polity. When the Church seeks to illegitimately extend its power in democratic societies, or when civil legislation is introduced to confer privileges to which no one denomination has any conceivable right, neither the Vatican nor Professor Jenkins should be surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground, and irrational and violent reactions increase.  Therefore special concern and attention should be directed toward those who have this inclination, lest they be led to believe that the subversion of the U.S. Constitution is a morally acceptable option. It is not.  With all this in mind, decent Catholics should ask their Bishops to be especially cautious of any programs that may seek to pressure American law and society to abrogate the rights of any citizens, even while claiming not to do so. A careful examination of the public statements and the activities conservative Catholic pressure groups promote reveals a blatant duplicity by which they attempt to mislead Catholics and the general public alike. For example, they may present the teaching of the Magisterium as if it were the mandatory source for all secular laws. Its specific authority is held to be binding on the entire society. Some of these groups will use the word "democratic" to describe either the organization or its intended actions, yet they do not defend and promote the interests of American society; indeed, they even openly attack it. Those within the Church who argue in this fashion often have close ties with those with similar views outside it. These latter groups are guided by a vision bitterly opposed to American liberty and pluralism. They reflect, even if not entirely consciously, a 'sacral state' ideology that denies the democratic nature of the United States, as well as the rights of every individual. This does not mean that conservative Catholics are not generous and giving of themselves on occasion, but when they engage in seditious activity against fellow citizens, they confirm within themselves a disordered political inclination that is essentially self-indulgent.   Jesus promised, "You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free" (Jn. 8:32). Conservative Catholics (including the hierarchy here and in the Vatican) should have the truth about American society and its secular democratic culture clearly explained to them so they will stop denigrating it so incessantly. After all, without the defeat of Nazism and U.S. opposition to Soviet communism, the young Karol Wojtyla might well have been shot in a secret police cellar instead of going on to become pontiff. There has never been a society in human history that afforded so many--Catholics included--the opportunity to practice their religion so freely as the United States. However, Catholics must be trustworthy custodians of other's freedoms as well as their own.  Perhaps Professor Jenkins's next book can take up this challenge. 
 I'm hoping that most of the people who wrote these reviews didn't actually stoop so low as to buy the book.  I read a few pages of it, and this is truly 7th-8th grade level writing.  I didn't realize that Bill's narcissism extended to the point at which he actually thought his writing was INTERESTING, rather than just blatantly one-sided and sickeningly arrogant.  Bill should stick to repetitive, "I know better," conservative babble - it gives us liberals/radicals/freethinkers something to make fun of 
 This book has a very serious omission on the subject of outdoor cats.  The book does not mention at all that outdoor cats are in grave danger of attack by coyotes in many parts of the country.  Coyotes are in places where many people wouldn't even expect them, such as in cities.  There are precautions you can take to eliminate this danger or greatly reduce the chance of an attack.  Unfortunately, this book does not list the precautions that should be taken.  And by the way, bobcats will also be happy to kill a house cat and similar precautions would apply 
 THE POOR QUALITY OF THE SOUND TRACKS(WHICH MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR) IS ONLY EXCEED BY YOUR TERRIBLE SERVICE IN MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBE TO MAKE A RETURN 
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 The publishers and Stephen Hawking evidently think they are reprinting Galileo's famous book supporting the Copernican viewpoint, "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems".  Instead, they've given us "Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences", a magnificent book (I use it as a text in my Galileo and Einstein course, see my website) BUT this book has nothing to say about planets or Copernicus -- the furthest object from earth in this book is a cannonball in flight!  It's a five star book, but not if you want to find out what Galileo thought of Copernicus.. 
   Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by  GM's unhealthy cost structure. The  company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger Smith becomes the reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney  UAW sponsored lies to  shift attention away from the  primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it.  Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and  how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore  is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a "documentary." 
 In page xvii of the introduction, Dr. Amen writes "Stimulant medications such as Adderall, Ritalin, or Dexedrine are among the safest and most effective medications in psychiatry". That sounds reassuring until you read the article in Medical News Today (August 22, 2006) mentioning that "Dexedrine and Ritalin are drugs used to treat ADHD. The FDA announced changes to their labels, and possibly those of some other ADHD drugs, to include a warning of a risk of heart problems and psychotic behavior". That is not reassuring at all. This book is writing in an authoritative style - sort of the bible of ADHD, the book that tells you what it is, and how to go about it. The only problem is that it is flawed.  
 I waited over 30 years to see this film, and now that I have -- I'm glad I waited that long.  Its glaring defects might not have been so obvious to me 30 years ago.    Nicholas, Alexandra, their daughters, their son, the people surrounding them -- not only are they not fictional, but thanks to the era in which they lived, they were photographed, we know what they actually looked like.  So who on earth did the casting?!  It was impossible to tell one Grand Duchess from another, and as for Alexandra -- in the first few scenes, I had trouble distinguishing the actress from someone in drag.  Janet Suzman was the worst casting flub of all, unless you count the stilted manner in which Michael Jayston delivered his lines.  What a stiff and boring character he makes Nicholas to be.  Yet there are photos extant of Nicholas smiling as he played with his children.  Nicholas was also portrayed as obsessed with holding on to his power as Tsar.  But in the Robert Massie book after which the movie was purportedly modeled, it was very clear that Nicholas was acutely aware of his responsibilities to the Russian people, as well as to his family, and above all his son, the future Tsar.  There was nothing exceptional about his behavior; most of Europe at the time was ruled by kings and queens, and to all of them, the thought of losing their thrones was simply unthinkable.  Yet this film falls into the trap most of us do, of judging history not on the basis of its own terms, but with our usual spectacularly accurate 20/20 hindsight.  Having been fed Soviet propaganda for 75 years, we have it entrenched in our minds that Nicholas was an extremely poor ruler.  That's the stunning success of the Massie book, that someone who had absolutely no connection to Russians, and no connection to royalty save for the one coincidence of both their sons having hemophilia, was able to overcome the general (and erroneous) "knowledge" of his time and write the kind of sympathetic biography of this family that was long lacking.  The movie, on the other hand, makes Nicholas look petty, and Alexandra slightly over the edge.  One petty anachronism was the scene that showed the royal family praying just prior to Nicholas's sending off his troops into World War I.  It was badly researched, to the point of ludicrousness.  The Tsars of Russia were all Orthodox Christians.  Orthodox Christianity has its own very distinctive music; in fact, Russian Orthodox chant is very different from Greek Orthodox chant.  So what kind of background music did the director choose?  Gregorian, of course!  Can we at least *strive* for a little authenticity?!  Apparently not.  Massie wrote in considerable detail about the attitude of the Romanovs towards their captors, how their guards had to be changed every three or so months because they kept winning over the Bolsheviks:  "You aren't anything like what we thought," was the most frequently quoted comment on the subject.  The movie showed nothing of that.  Well -- in the end, it was this exact trait of graciousness and consideration towards their captors that ended up getting the Romanov family canonized in the Russian Orthodox Church.  That movement was well underway by 1971; I wonder, if the directors and producers had done a little more thorough research, if the film would have been a tad more sympathetic to these five people caught between two worlds and two cultures.  All in all, purchasing the movie was a waste of money.  Maybe the Bolsheviks over at the University's Russian Department will appreciate my donating it -- that way, others can get to see it without wasting their money 
 In a nutshell: If you own a Mac, do NOT buy this machine. I struggled with Brother's tech support system several times to make it work with my iBook running OS 10.4, and still have not been able to scan a thing. I've also begun having problems sending faxes, as the machine eats the documents. Last time I had to send an important document, I went to an Office Depot and paid to send it for fear of it being eaten by this machine. Buyer beware--especially Mac users 
 Borrow the book from the library.  Wasting your money on fables is not wise (unless you like wasting money).  While entertaining, this is not worthy of a library collection item 
 About 25% of this book is a good argument for a pacifism based on liberal protestant Christianity. The other 75% the same old defense of liberalism by using favorite Bible verses and biased interpretations of the same. (This can be done by right-wingers as well using their favorite verses, of course, and it often is.) His false or unproven premises outside the sphere of religion are one of the things that kill his arguments, e.g., the supposed mistreatment of war prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the supposed military support of Saddam's army which turns out to be 1% of his arms (he got the other 99% from the former Soviet Union.)  Another interesting thing to note is that most people who make arguments from the way in which the "early Christians" lived (33-300 AD) usually pick and choose what they like. The early Christians believed in strict penances for sin, some of them even believing that a Christian could only be forgiven once for a given sin. They also believed celibacy was a higher state than married life, abortion was a grave moral evil and that the Bishop of Rome was infallible when he spoke on faith and morals.  I realize that these do not directly touch the subject of this book, but Martos takes the "puritan" approach by insinuating that development of the just war doctrine was purely pragmatic and we need to take the supposed pacifism of the early Christians to heart yet not their devout Roman Catholicism 
 This is made-up fake stuff by a wanna-be. Why not read the real - try Marryat's "Mr Midshipman Easy", etc. Marryat joined the Royal Navy in 1806 (yes 18) and fought against the French in the Med. He wrote this book in 1836 (yes 18) - it and other sources were  used by Forrester to create the Hornblower character. Read this book and compare situations to the early Hornblower actions - like identical. 
 I admit, I haven't finished this book.  A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia.  I was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing UNTIL she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels.  Granted, I am not a firm believer in just "the hard facts" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her! 
 Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid 
 The only reason I purchased this book was because I heard this particular author on the radio giving great advice to female callers concerning their relationships. If this book was written as well as he speaks this book WOULD have been a great read. I found nothing thought provoking in this book what so ever. A lot of his thoughts were outdated and he seriously needed a spell check or fire his editor. The typo's in this book are horrendous leaving me to wonder how it got published in the first place. Big boom should stick to public speaking. He's a far better speaker then he'll ever be at writing. 
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
 If you want to watch a bunch of the Undertakers best matches then this is a good DVD.  If you want to learn anything of the history of the Undertaker, either the man or the character you won't get any of that here.  This is bascially a bunch of matches with a little voice over in between, similar to the Ric Flair DVD (but without the great promos as Taker isn't exactly one of wrestlings great speakers, nor is Paul Bearer for that mater lol).  This DVD has no vignette with interviews with the wrestler or history of the character from McMahon and company whatsover (unlike the Bret Hart, Hogan and Warrior DVD's).  Furthermore the cover art is horrible and all of the discs are all stuffed into one side of the box (as opposed to it opening up to several DVD flaps with picture art (e.g. Flair and Hart DVD's).  If you are a wrestling purist then it is okay, else wait for the inevitable second 5 or 6 disc DVD WWE will release when he retires in a year or two.  
 Don't waste your time on this book, even for 1st timers this stuff is old and out of date.  Get Jeff Galloway's Marathon instead 
 I picked this up after reading Calder's Dead Things trillogy which I enjoyed a great deal for its fetishistic, perverse, and increasingly disjointed world.   Frenzetta does create an interesting world which could provide an interesting story but it seems that Calder has lost his pace.  One of the major drives in Dead Things was the fetishistic intensity which he sucessfully integrated into the plot.  The same intensity is present in this book but the world he created disallows the same integration in to the story.   As a result, it comes off as obscessive rather than interesting.     I was even more dissapointed by The Twist so while this wasn't as good as I expected, it was still readable.   If you're a Calder fan, its worth a read... as long as you find it used.    Otherwise Calder needs to give up on the deadly dolly thing until he can make it work again 
 I bought this book because I became curious after reading the various posted reviews. I do Yoga occasionally, and I was lucky enough to find an excellent book when I was 14 (over 25 years ago...), which was written by a Briton who was extremely balanced, pleasant, and clear in his writing. I cannot say that this book had the same effect on me. I found the author of the secret art rather pompous and arrogant and, in the circumstances, this made it harder for me to take seriously the whole book. While the movements make a nice workout, which I have no doubt can be healthy and cleansing of both mind and body, the messenger is not a very good advertisement. Making fun and speaking with such superiority about everything that is not the secret art, and accusing just about everybody of being superficial and stupid (unless, of course, one practices the art) suggests to me that the art in question has not really worked its magic on this teacher. Giving advice about being tolerant and well-disposed towards others sounds pretty moot, coming from this source. I gave the book two stars because of the practical part, even though I found some of the explanations of the movements rather wanting, although overall clear enough 
 I completely agree with TonyGreen7.  This book was a total disappointment.  How are you supposed to learn such a complicated technology when have the time you are fighting your way through typos, ommissions and grammatical errors. UGH!!!! 
 I bought this toy for my shark-crazed 5 year-old... she was so stoked and we prepped the tank, added the recommended water chemicals and dropped in two small goldfish. Less than 24 hours later, they were dead. Repeat... 40 hours later... same story. We tried a single Betta, Frank, but less than 4 days later... he's dead. We don't know what it is. The water was tested, it's fine. We think it is the overall design of the tank, could the tight-fitting lid be responsible? Possibly ammonia by-product buildup from the fish? Who knows. But we have given up and are dumping this promising toy into the trash bin 
 There are so many better books on the market and this is quite frankly unimpressive. If Schiffman is a good salesman he does not demonstrate it. I had phone interaction with him once and found him to be obnoxious. The only good thing about this book is that it doesn't cost much 
 Wish I had heeded the advice of most of the reviewers before I purchased this. I went ahead and purchased this because it was replacing a Braun coffee maker that we had had for 10 - 15 years.  After it got the new plastic taste out of it, it made good coffee. Even without the Brita Filter.  Just like all the reviewers indicated, the carafe leaked and spilled badly unless you poured very slowly and carefully.  Unfortunately, it has quit working after only 2 1/2 months.  The seller, Etronics, is declining to do anything about it saying it is now outside of their 30 return period.  That will be the last thing I buy through them.  Like uhh, since they sell Braun,one would think they would have some recourse through Braun and try to help their customers.  So, here I am between the proverbial rock and a hard place,  try to find a Braun warranty center and wait for it to get repaired or replaced, or just bite the bullet an go buy another. (want to bet it won't be a Braun?) Additionally, what do we do for coffee in the mean time?  Such are the hazards of purchasing an electric appliance on the internet 
 The drive has great capacity and works fast enough. However, after seeking it makes a very high pitched noise. It is not even that loud and yet I can't stand it at all. Would not recommend based on this if you have any kind of sensitive hearing. Additionally the drive has no means to set it to run slower but with less noise unlike other drives 
 The music is fine but if you listen to your music on a computer, be aware that the disk is "copy protected" (a nice way of saying "defective by design") so that one track won't play correctly on a computer or transfer to an iPod or MP3 player. You gets pops and stutters. Apparently the makers of the disk presume that we are all thieves and act accordingly; I wanted a legal copy on my iPod because that's how I listen to my music but no dice. They stole my money. Don't let them steal yours. 
 If you are looking for love, romance, witty banter and everything else that has made Suzanne Brockmann a hit....don't expect it from this book!!  The romance is undeveloped, sparse and stale.  The suspense is based on gore and the end is abrupt.  A great read if you're looking for nightmares.  
 This is no longer a good book. Its too out of date and is in serious need of a good overhaul. Look for something else. 
 I found this book to be flat, dull and boring and the authour to be rather self-congratulatory.  The author travels from one small Sicilian town to another trying to ... do what?  I dunno.  I read every word, and she didn't have much to say about Sicily or her people except that she likes them.  She really likes them!    As the series of vignettes progressed, it became difficult to follow any kind of time line. What happened when and with whom?  Dunno.  I am still unclear on how this book of little stories was organized, if indeed it was.    Finally, I don't know that I gleaned anything from the book except that the author really likes Sicily and she's really glad that she got to live there and she's really lucky that anyone would publish her book 
 I must live on the edge of Cingular's (and everyone  else's) coverage area.  This phone can't hold a call at my house, and I have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows several bars strength.  Part of the problem is the coverage area, but part is the phone, too.  I have friends who have made and received calls from my home with no problem.  If you live like I do in a pothole on the Information Superhighway, avoid this phone.  
 After 18 months over dating , I thought I would give this book to my boyfriend in hopes he could come to a decision about marriage or the possibility in the following year.Before this everything was fine!After I put this PRESSURE on him to think about what he wants, etc. He BOLTED and cheated on me- something that is not even natural for him out of total fear!I think the realtionship is over for good now because I could not wait until HE WAS READY to do this on his own- Don't make the same mistakes I did- throw out "the Rules" and these other manipulative this that tell you how to make a man marry you and give ultimatums. Any time you use these tactics you are taking a risk they will backfire on you. I would do anything to take back what I did, but it is to late (probably) and I will have to learn from my mistakes 
 ... an attempt by her publisher to make some "free" money. they slap Weiner's name on a cover, get some buzz, and watch it go. the problem is - these stories are sub-par. if she was not Jennifer Weiner, they would not have been  published. and i think it's a shame that they convinced her to hand them over. even in her notes after the last story, she mentions how more than a few were rejected. i think i know why: the themes are repetitive, the story arcs are weak or non-existent and the characters start blending together after a while. i think in the future she should stick to novels, or write some brand new short stories, with a fresh perspective and featuring characters of more depth. and no more marketing ploys 
 I have watched all of Jack Black's films and I have found this one to be his worst. My Wife and I couldn't keep from sleeping through it. I will admit that there were some silly parts and somewhat funny parts, but for the most part we had to force ourselves to laugh at this ridiculous movie. I'll more cautious before I rent another Jack Black movie. I hope this doesn't ruin his career 
 I found this book to be very biased and offensive.  I agree with one of the other reviewers, her section on hyperemesis is downright wrong and condescending.  As long as you have a healthy pregnancy and want a natural childbirth, you might like this book.  For the rest of the world that lives in reality, you might find her narrow-minded approach offensive 
 I do not understand what the hype about this dvd is. I baught it according to [] reviews, but unfortunatly, was very dissapointed. I def felt a burn in my upper abs, but you are laying on your back THE ENTIRE TIME. There is no changing positions and targeting the abs from diferent angles. To me, it was basically crunch after crunch after crunch. Would not recommend it unless you want buldge in your upper abs 
 I have to start by saying that I have been a huge fan of every sound Paul  has ever recorded since In The City (which I still listen to on vinyl.)   That being said, this isn't just a bad Paul Weller album; it would be a bad  Winger album.  I kept listening to it, trying to find a redeeming quality.   Sorry Paul, it seems we both failed 
 The authors provide a lot of sophisticated-sounding analysis to substantiate their "novel" approach to market timing.  As evidenced by some of the reviews on this site, this approach succeeds in garnering the authors their share of believers.    However, their analysis is in reality quite unsophisticated.  Scratch beneath the surface and you will come across profound breakdowns in logic and a host of invalid analytical techniques.  Some of the book's most egregious failings are detailed by reviewer Gaetan Lion.  I recommend you read his review---he hits the nail right on the head.   
 As another reviewer said in his 1-star review of this book, the sections on poker are excellent but they are buried inside of seemingly endless chapters on Ted Binion's murder, the author's grandparents, and all kinds of other nonsense.  While those subjects could possibly be fascinating, McManus isn't nearly good enough as a writer to make them interesting.  So what we're left with is a highly-compelling description of the 2000 WSOP for about 1/3rd of the book and then 2/3rds garbage.    Best avoided if you're looking for a poker book 
 I gave the record two stars because the guitar playing is decent. Other than that this thing doesn't have much going for it. The songs all sound similar and no effort was put into creating decent lyrics. If Soma were music, there's a good chance it would sound very similar to this album 
 I was rather dissappointed at the content offered and barely impressed at the book's attempt at teaching new skills.  I bought the book for my 5, 7 and 9 year old children and the 9 year-old had already mastered all of the skills offered, the 7 year-old was bored very quickly and only the 5 year old's attention was held any length of time, but his age group lacks the concetration level to hang on for long.  The content was far too simple and barely progressed through the entire book...this book should be marketed to only highly introverted 4-6 year-olds in my opinion, and then it would get only 3 stars... 
 Keneally writes reasonably well -- not exciting, but serviceable prose. Possibly if you are a committed Catholic and interested in the difference between today's Catholic beliefs and those of fifty years ago, this novel might keep you awake. Otherwise, this novel is exhausting in its exploration of an inexperienced priest's coming-of-age, and the plot is slow-paced--I couldn't make it to the promised murder. Besides, the victim was so uninteresting, I couldn't bring myself to care who might have killed her 
 My daughter got this came for Christmas and it is still fun to play, but the new graphics are very confusing and hard to follow.  They want a little overboard in their updating of this one.  New colors would have been fine, but all the curves, zig-zags, etc, make this version a poor substitute for the older versions.  I'm going to ebay! 
 As the sole dissenting view so far, I'll say that perhaps one has to have read Byatt's critically acclaimed "Possession" in order to appreciate what she's done here but I must admit I was unable to do so.  I found it sorely misleading to lable these stories as horror stories since absolutely nothing about them was scary or even remotely horrific in any way. I wasn't expecting to find a Stephen King story here but neither was I expecting to find "Body Art" - a story about a doctor who gets a young woman pregnant and forces her to have the baby. An interesting character study perhaps but nothing at all supernatural or like anything that's advertised on the back of the cover.  Something may be said for the author's poetic writing style and she does effectively pull off the modern fairy tale for grown-ups tone but frankly it was a tone that lulled me to boredom and eventually to sleep.  I found most of the characters dull and many of them unlikable.  I thought that these stories would be an interesting and short introduction to an author I keep hearing so much about. Sadly, as I was barely able to finish this little black book I doubt I'll be picking up any of her longer works. If you're looking for poetic character studies with dark tones, I recommend this one. If you're looking for something scary that won't bore you to death with page long descriptions of nature at every turn look somewhere else because you won't find it here.         
 This book may be written about a fascinating literary figure at an interesting time in our history, with a potentially atmospheric setting and an intriguing mystery to boot--but it all adds up to nothing when the prose is so bad. I listened to about half this book on tape, but found I just could not bear another minute of it. It was stilted, repetitive, and trite. The language used in dialog and at moments of high drama was just plain embarrassing. Some suggest that the author was trying to emulate the way people spoke in the 19th c, but I don't believe anyone in history would've been this ponderous or repetitive in everyday speech; if so, such conversations are best forgotten.  I love mysteries and historical fiction, but have read boilerplate novels in these genres which are far less agonizing and more entertaining to read. 
 ........from reading Danielle Steel.  Here's the book:  three bachelors meet three women.  They all break up, they all end up happily ever after.  BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.  I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.  Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel.  My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers.  THAT'S sad 
 If you enjoy reading hyper-intellectual bloviating pontificating verbiage about very little, then this is the book for you.  A gift from a friend, I expected to be uplifted by this book, and to learn more about Jesus, but instead I found very little about Jesus at all.  It is telling that I had to go to basically the middle of the book to actually find scripture.  This is a book by man with no Spirit in it.  The Catholic church has nothing to fear from this book.  Most will be dead by boredom long before they finish 
 I never recieved any replacement paln informtion regarding my warenty. I had customer service email stating they would send me the paperwork for the plan but never did. II sure hope when I need to use it I will be able to. 
 Stick with the 2002 and 2003 CD's. This one lacks the kick of the others and the chosen songs don't flow well 
 Never seen a worse, less intuitive, inconvenient to use and worsely documented software that iTunes. Apples is up to it's usual standard. That's precisely why I prefer not to mess with it 
 I didn't see the VH1 show, or I might have been more prepared for what I was buying.  Saw the duration of the dvd and figured the listed songs must be extended versions.    So I put in the dvd and sat back, planning to enjoy an evening of great music.  But then Bruce began to talk...and talk...and then he talked some more.  Yes, he talked about the songs and the story they told.  He talked about his philosphy of life that was inherent in those songs and the stories they told.  Had I not been expecting and looking forward to hearing him sing songs, perhaps I would have been more interested in his outlook on life.  But frankly if I want philosophy I don't go to Bruce Springsteen.    I go to Tom Cruise. 
 Why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water?! How many calories does water have to begin with?! It would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial(?a cheeseburger?). Please do NOT buy this. Fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to.... NO CALORIES! Give the money that you would have spend to charity. The makers of this water are thieves and con artists 
 American Pie: an immature, mindless, vapid, boring, blandly disgusting, humor lacking piece of over-rated trash packed full of cliches, highschool sterotypes, annoying horny teenaged behavior performed by a wonderful cast of grade A douchebags. 
 I picked up this book because it sounded like something that EVERYONE should read.  We definitely need to slow down, become involved in our communities and bring more happiness back into our lives.  What I was subjected to in this book, however, was the author's political rants about how Conservatives have ruined this country!  I'm an independent and I actually felt sorry for any conservative who might be reading this book - it was harsh.  We are ALL a part of the problem, which makes us ALL a part of the solution.  She does have some great quotes and some ideas that sound good no matter what your political party may be - hence the two stars.  The joy is hidden in the vitriol in this book 
 I bought this book for ideas and best practices. I work in retail design. The quality of the printing of the book was not very good; photos didn't give much of a sense of scale, materials used. And the examples seemed very dated to me.  If you are a retail design professional, you are better off heading to a local mall, taking some notes and pics yourself 
 I received this subscription as a trial, and found it one of the most boring publications that I have ever read.  By the last few issues that I got, I wasn't even looking at the pictures anymore.  There are drawn-out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life, which were very materialistic.  At the end of every issue there were pictures of "real-life" wedding announcements.  Perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper, but it struck me as out of place in a magazine 
 If you read the outside cover of the CD Audiobook, you get the impression that the volume strongly will deal with the manner in which FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt led the country during World War II.  However, what you get is more often innuendo about FDR's fascination with women other than his wife, whether his prviate secretaries, a visiting princess, or his mistress of many years.  Eleanor is covered in more detail than was expected, but she comes off pretty well, her husband's wandering eye notwithstanding.  Goodwin does provide some insight into the challenges of running the United States during the critical war years, but the amount of time devoted to private pursuits was not what was expected.  I had hoped for a lot more detail on the warimte effects of the economy, and the challenges it served the president.  I had hopes of more on FDR's handling of race and labor issues, but did not get it.  I had hopes of learning more about FDR's partnership with the Congress to achieve the nation's goals, but was disappointed there as well.  This was the first Goodwin book I picked up, and it didn't put me off enough to avoid her amazingly good Team of Rivals, about Lincoln and his cabinet.  Still, I remain disappointed that the book's cover and inside clearly focused on other issues than what was projected 
 I was at my cousan's house and we were listenening to these old tapes that were in a shobox. It was really funny. This is nothing like the music or today. This is the music you hear in groshery stores. We also listened to pink floyd the wall, dark side of the moon, and the first cut. These were a little better becuase they sound all angry and loud and how they hate school. 
 If you can get past the over-the-top exagerations, you might even finish this book.  Example (pages 57 & 58):    "The most gut-wrenching loss I personally experienced was a $10 million betting disaster when I was 17."  "They were all kingpins, sitting on ridiculous cash surpluses."   "They played, as did I, soley with C-notes..."  "The pot was brewing, $30 million strong..."  $30 million is the equivilent of 300,000 C-notes...just how big was the table?         
 Professor Ellis is a very intelligent man, but he plays fast and loose with the facts, and sometimes he uses his gift for writing prose in ways that mislead the reader especially in, American Sphinx.  Ellis has obviously covered all of the ground with regard to what is known about Jefferson--but he doesn't objectively present all of the factual scholarship existing about our 3rd President.   If you want to know more of the detail of what was all involved with Sally Hemings, you MUST read Douglass Adair's essay "The Jefferson Scandals."  This essay is found in the book: Fame of the Founding Fathers: Essays by Douglass Adair.  Published by W.W. Norton.  Sally Hemings was the daughter of Jefferson's father-in-law; and Sally's lover was not T.J. but T.J.'s nephew (his sister's son).  That's why Jefferson never talked about the "scandal" because his close family relatives were involved; however, not the way Prof. Ellis says.  The unfortunate fact is that Prof. Ellis mentions Douglass Adair in American Sphinx, but he never mentions Adair's research (which Ellis cannot reasonably be ignorant of) on the alleged Sally Hemings-Thomas Jefferson liason.  It's obvious from American Sphinx that Ellis has read Adair's essays.  Prof. Ellis must know that the best evidence exonerates Thomas Jefferson, but he never tells us about that. The well publicized DNA test does NOT prove TJ was the father of any of Hemings' children.  TJ never fathered any children with Hemings and Ellis knows it. Prof. Ellis is intellectually dishonest on this point, and on many other points of Jefferson's life.  Too bad because he would otherwise have written a tour-de-force.  Instead it's a tour-de-FRAUD 
 I found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written, but also insidiously demeaning to women. Rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships, the author focused on the weakness and instability of women. In addition, his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage. I found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes. My fiancee and I have read Chapman's Five Love Languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise 
 The content of this book is nothing short of a diaster! I had to read this book for my Ethics in the Information Age class here at the Rochester Institute of Technology and I must say that this is the worst textbook I ever had to read. It felt more like a highschool essay thats 155 pages long. The book is plagued with wordy sentences that can confused and bemuddle anyone who isn't an english major. Practically every sentence is littered with words that a bare few of us remember from the SATs (perhaps to lengthen the book?). The book's content doesn't provide a sense of contraversy about ethics in cyberspace. I beleive that he tried to stay neutral in the arguments but it only seemed to confuse me. The auther included a lot of references to other sources suggesting that he too doesn't even know a thing about Cyber Ethics, resorting to other people's works. The writng is too abstract and at most times I ended up rereading the book several times just to make sense of it. If I didn't need this for class, I recommend not buying this book. I am sure there are plenty of other well written Cyber Ethics books than this 
 I'm fascinated by the rave reviews for this text. I used it for a community college stats course and once I was in the classroom with it, I became aware that I had some problems. It is true that it's written in a friendly style and has plenty of exercises, but I found it to be poor preparation for my students who will be going on to higher levels of statistics in behavioral science courses.  I found myself explaining, more times than I wish to recall, how formulas look different in other statistics books, and I was disconcerted at the lack of use of symbols that one usually sees in beginning statistics courses. Simple terms most commonly used in statistics were not introduced at all, and most statistical tests were not mentioned. Many students found it to be cumbersome and a bit overwhelming.   It's my own fault, really. I did not spend enough time perusing texts. And my familiarity with statistics prevented me, when looking it over, from realizing how much was really missing. I realized that my students would enter bachelor's programs lacking some very basic information that is always used in statistics for the behavioral sciences. Most of my students plan to earn graduate degrees; I had to spend quite a bit of time preparing notes for them as well as lectures explaining formulas, symbols, and terminology that "some of" their higher courses might use. And with nary a mention of ANOVA or any other higher level tests, I felt I really had done my students a disservice.  I began to wonder - have I been out of school so long that things have changed this much and I'm not aware of it? But - as I am teaching at a state college, stats texts started trickling in from other publishers. I saw that it was not me. This massive text, costing my students $120, is lacking quite a bit that they should be exposed to - to better prepare them for future statistics studies in the behavioral sciences. This was certainly a bitter lesson for me! I had to waste far too much time putting together information that was missing just so my students would have the course they should have.  I recommend Sally Caldwell's text, "Statistics Unplugged" for beginning students - at least in behavioral sciences programs. It's a third the cost, a third the SIZE, and much more reader-friendly. And it contains the information that I had to supply to my students just so they would get what they paid for.   I do not recommend this book. I'll certainly be much more careful in future when choosing textbooks 
 My alarm clock is set at 3:40. Superhero underwear is cool. CD Drives blink. I got a concussion from the fire alarm. Puppies will conquer the world. Wonder Woman Would beat up Superman. U r the coolest person in the world. Thank you for looking at this useless revie 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 This book wasn't the best offering I have ever had.  It was very poorly written and hard to understand.  This fact is proven when they are discussing the city roads and you can't follow a thing. On the other hand there is a load of information, but it is not worth it.  I only got through have the book.  It was incredibly hard to follow, and there were little explanations for the things that happened.  It included information that was never neccesary.  This book isn't worth picking up.  Unfortunately there aren't many othr books on the case 
 Like the idea of getting some samples, but once you refrig these it is tough to get the sauce out of the small bottles.   Do not buy. 
 The story is set in late 1943 but is unbelievable due to bad costumes and worse acting. A decent plot exploring the relationship between man and his enemy may be enough to keep the watcher awake, but maybe not. 
 This book gets one star because you can't give zero. I have a B.A. in European History and I am utterly horrified by the historical inaccuracies in this series. As examples taken at random (there are lots, lots more of them): in Book One, Bauer describes Alcibiades as betraying Athens and leading an army into the city. Utterly incorrect. She admits she moved Boudicca's revolt until a later date in order to show that the Roman Empire was breaking down. Hello, you can't move historic dates in order to "prove" a hypothesis. In book Two, in her description of Justinian's rise to Emperor she basically says that he left the farm, studied hard and was chosen emperor. In point of fact, his uncle was emperor. Her historical errors go on and on. The author evidently didn't even bother to check her "facts" against something as simple as wikipedia. Bauer, according to her cover blurb, is a novelist and journalist with no apparent academic training in history, and, boy, does that lack of academic training show. She writes appealing journalistic hyperbole but doesn't bother to back her breezy simplifications with historical facts. Bauer also has a strong religous agenda. I'm a Christian myself but find the presentation of bible stories as historical events offensive. Anyone using this book to teach history to their child is doing their child a vast disservice. 
 Beautiful mug and the coffee stays hot. When they say leakproof lid, however, they really mean it. Even in the open position NOTHING comes out!!! Can't figure out if it is possible to adjust the lid. We have to drink our beverages with the lid off which defies to whole purpose of "travel mugs". I took advantage of the 5 year warrenty and the replacements had the same problem. Apperently as the gasket on the lid heats up it expands. Then the seal is just as tight as if it were in the closed position. We are very unhappy with this product and I wish to give it -5 Stars 
 "...Allosaurus liked to hunt,and when it caught its quarry,it tore it open,back and front,and never said," I'm sorry!" Allosaurus liked to eat,and using teeth and talons,it stuffed itself with tons of meat,and  guzzled blood by gallons." If you think your child does not see enough  violence on TV then you should buy this book 
 dont buy this gadget. it is bad choice and the quality of the signal is affull. alot static in the 4 frecuency 
 Of the many books and periodical articles that I have read concerning the Spanish Inquisition, this is the most biased and speculative and opinionated.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It is extremely long and tedious. We realize that the Inquisition was shameful. However, this work substitutes one prejudice for another 
 but stupid and mindless. Presley was never an actor, and proves it once again here. But the songs are even worse than his acting. There are no good ones. None. Not even the title song, whioch was never a major hit for him. The rest of the cast is the usual melange of unknowns or semi-knowns who either totally non-act, or overact with the extremely limited talent they have. Only Harry Morgan, who was likely the only really talented one in the bunch (OK, Strauss to a degree, too) seemed to be having a good time; it's almost as if he went into the movie with a "Hell, it's a paycheck" attitude. The ending goes beyond trite into fantasy. And what can you say about Donna Douglas? Well, she was slightly better here than as Ellie May Clampett. But that's like saying one shade of battleship gray is a bit less dull than the other. The humor in the Beverly Hillbillies rarely, if ever, developed from her. Catch this on TV if you have a few minutes to kill 
 I was very excited when i bought this book since i am from the Caribbean.However i was disappointed with it. The authors way of telling the story is very dry and sometimes hard to follow.On several parts of the book i found myself trying to read fast so i can get to the real interesting parts. I believe that the author relies too much on the economics of the region while avoiding telling us important events and information on the region.For example he never tells us why the islands were named with the names that they have today.Why Cuba? Where doest it come from? Why Antigua? Why Martinique? Sometimes this book reads like an economics report which makes it very dull and boring at times.I guess the author assumes you know most of the story.Again, very dull and dry history on a region that is full of history and action. 
 Although many lessons are given, not many examples are shown. It assumes that one knows a lot about teaching the subject and has had similar lessons in the past. Good for experienced teachers, not so good for those new to the subject. I would recommend Resnick's "Design for Communication" instead 
 Not a book for beginners, since it is extremely confusing and poorly organized. You have to deeply study the book in order to get any benefit as opposed to reading it. The presentation and the drawings are all jumbled up and hard to follow. NOT WORTH I 
 Sorry for the sarcasm, but I can't help thinking just how uninspired this book is.  Imagine a counter to this book.  This book would promote "hate", "dishonesty", "immorality", "ignorance, "ingratitude".... you get the picture.  This Mormon leader's great contribution to world is to say we should be honest?  Now that was profound!  Sadly, Gordo and his wrinkled cadre have this bad habit of taking the basic decency of the members of the church and attributing it to the implausible myths they peddle to the world.   As an avowed atheist, I encourage everyone to be honest, moral, learned, and all the things Gordo promotes in this book.  There is nothing wrong with promoting these and they have nothing to do with Mormonism.  But this book is written for children and sheep.  Promoting this book among the various books that seriously discuss morality, ethics and other serious issues is like watching a high school team play the New England Patriots or comparing a Janice Kapp Perry vapid song to Bach's Mass in B minor.    Mormonism is declining in real terms because their leadership does not have the capacity to address and provide any illumination to the relevant issues of the 21st century.  This book should confine itself to the children's section or to the local Deseret Book store.   
 I've been a huge fan of Ms Cornwell for a long time, and I have a hard time believing that the author who wrote the first nine Scarpetta books is the same person who wrote Blowfly, Trace, Predator, and now, At Risk.  The last of Ms Cornwell's books that I actually purchased was Blowfly (big mistake!), and since then I will not spend a cent on one of her books until I've read a copy from the library.  When I first read the jacket on At Risk, I was very surprised and pleased to see that it wasn't another Scarpetta novel - all her characters in that series had become much too bizzare, pathetic, or just plain unlikeable - and had great hopes that she had written something new and fresh.  However, At Risk is no better (and probably worse in many ways) than her last three.  It actually doesn't start out too badly (not brilliant, but the characters and plot have some potential), but then, just as the plot and suspense are rising, you start the next chapter and find out that the detectives have it all solved!  The story has no rhythm, continuity, or logic to it.  The last half of the book reads like it was thrown together in about an hour.  Very disappointing.  I'm still hoping that Ms Cornwell will write another wonderful thriller (particularly if she continues to concentrate on fresh material and forget about the Scarpetta series) - after all, that talent must still be in there somewhere!  In the meantime, I won't waste my money and will be using my library card more 
 Being that it is only about 90 pages long, I was able to finish this story in one afternoon. It is easy to see why Whites and Blacks get such different messages from the book.   The reader is encouraged, throughout the story, to be sympathetic to the White characters. Since most Whites, even in the 21st century, have yet to shed their racist garments, they will naturally emphathize with the plight of these poor White guys who, unfortunately, are "forced" to put up with the strangeness of this strange land in order to steal the resources from that land's inhabitants. After all, White guys are having to put up with similar trials even today in order to steal the resources from, yeah, that's right, the same country, the Congo. Oh, pity those poor French military advisors who are forced to go into the "Heart of Darkness" to keep the natives fighting each other, to make sure they don't turn on the real theives of their abundant mineral resources. The horror! The horror!  By contrast, Conrad's treatment of his black characters is non-existent. They are soul-less beasts of burden. Conrad doesn't even bother to give them names. They are just referred to as niggers. When they are described as being beaten, or left alone to die, or forced to work on Marlow's ship for over a month with no food except rotten hippo meat (Marlow's only concern was that the smell of the rotted meat was annoying the White guys), Conrad writes of these incidents with no more sympathy than what you would expect from a description of an ant being stepped on by our poor embattled protagonist. Only a Black fool would not be offended by Conrad's work and Barak Obama is anything but that.  To get some idea of just how bad Conrad's character development is, compare it to that of one of his contemporaries who actually had talent ... Mark Twain. It is a sign of Twain's genius that he could suck Whites in by using the word "nigger", but at the same time get them to see his black characters as human beings. His black characters had names, families, they could even feel love and pain. Just like White people. Imagine that. 
 Compared to the British series of the same title this is a very bad rip off.  The acting is of poor quality as well as the dialogue.  I would not waste my dime on this, instead I would get the original 
 Of all the books I have read and discussed, there is one book that we never should trust...when I got this book out from the library I was all geared up for a great read...therefore was greatly disappointed as I read this book.  MacDonald is unfortunately negative about all of The Beatles songs, and in particular has it in for George and Ringo's numbers. I found that he did not have a single positive comment about any of The Beatles songs - no matter who wrote them. It makes one wonder why he wrote a book on them. If you are looking for a book with a positive approach to the Beatles masterpieces, this isn't the book you should be buying. I reccommend "A Day In The Life, the Music and Artistry of The Beatles, by Mark Hertsgaard, instead of MacDonald's sloppy, single-minded musings. This book should be put to shame 
 We meet Josie Flynn a soon to be divorcee, who is just starting to get over her divorce from Damien. For her winter vacation from work she is headed to New York for her cousin Martha's wedding. While on the plane, she is seated next to the charming and handsome Matt, the rock journalist, who is also recently divorced. They share their horror stories, and seem to becoming friends. Once they land in NY they decided to meet for an afternoon at the Statue of Liberty. After this point the book serisoulsy goes down hill. We are then treated to a cat and mouse game while Matt is looking for Josie. Throw into the mix an unbelievably lavish wedding, an affair (or 2 depending how you look at it), an ex husband who comes toting an expensive gift to win back Josie's affection, and a duck and it make a very unbelievable book. 
 Preparing cow brains and eels might be simple for some, but most will find this a very impractical guide to French cooking. "Pretentious French Food," would be a more appropriate title 
 F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life 
 Brick's biggest hit, "Dazz" is spectacular in its long version, with its whistling/flute combo which I've never heard before or since in any musical genre.  You'd think it would naturally be included on the greatest hits album, since they are essentially a one hit wonder.  No such luck, as this compilation contains the short radio version of the song.  "Dusic" is the only other song which is halfway decent, but hardly warrants shelling out $10.  What a disappointment.. 
 Yet another book twisting imagination with presumably commercial intent. If you believe Atlantis was 5 million years ago ... dream on. In my opinion, another waste of paper not to praise. Yes, I do buy these books, to save others their valuable time 
 I'm a big fan of Outlaw and Texas Country, however, still album was not for me.  Hank III is too raw, too basic, and too lacking for me.  However, he does have a very unique sound and style and I can't think of anyone else out there that he sounds like.  Still I'd be cautious about buy this CD and listen to the song samples that Amazon provides 
 There's a reason Oar flopped when it was released back in 1969: it sucks.  Thirty eight years later, with Skip Spence safely in his grave, some now give this pitiful mess *five* stars.  Since you can't give more than five stars here, they're saying Oar is on a level with masterpieces like Sergeant Pepper... Dark Side of the Moon... Led Zeppelin 4....!  Just between you and me, I think the government is still secretly drugging people.    With all due respect to Skip's venerable memory, Oar is a painful aural experience.  The first two tracks, Little Hands and Cripple Creek, are halfway good, and show some production values; but things quickly deteriorate from there.  One gets the impression the rest of Oar was cobbled together in the recording studio just prior to taping - then put in the can after only one or two takes.  Lastly, the bass playing and drumming are just awful.  Yes, it's too bad that things ended up like they did for Skip. And it's hard not to sympathize with him - he flew high only to crash hard.  But let's keep a sense of perspective: His tragedy did not translate into good music.  One extra star in his memory. 
 I'm not Christian. I'm Agnostic and I picked up the book because I thought it looked interesting and I wanted to learn something about Christianity.  This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read. Let me be clear that I am saying nothing against religion in this review. I cant judge that, but I can review this terrible writing. LaHaye and Jenkins seem to have no concept of motivation, logic, or storytelling. It's as if when writing the book they had ideas of where the characters should end up, but then used the first idea that popped into their heads about how that should happen with no critical thought at all.   As stated before, the names of the characters should have given me pause, the most egregous being Chang Wong, a name so stereotyped that I cant believe the authors have ever met an Asian. At this book in the series the world has devolved into a right wing nutjob survivalist fantasy, where the TribForce(...) is living literally underground, in rebellion against the New World Order(who call themselves, wait for it: the New World Order).   The final battle of the Apocalypse is fought on ATV's and horses.  Jesus. 
 I am disgusted that you would even think to ask me what my thoughts are. I emailed you with a complaint that the copy I bought was listed as new. I complained that the page edges gave the appearance they had been torn using a ruler rather than guillatined. I was very disapointed with the book and even moreso that you failed to reply to my email - I have bought a few books fom you and intended to buy more but your professionalism is so lacking that I think from now on I'll shop elsewhere.

 This is a perfect example of why "Chicano" literature took so long to catch on. America had to wait until its population was saturated with the Mexican filth. This use of hispanic language is this book was distracting and gratuitous; however, the most disturbing part of the novel was the incessant mention of some act of incest between Sonny, the stories protagonist, and his first cousing. Please excuse me while I vomit. I want to defecate on this book before I turn it back in to the library. 
 First of all, the book's not written by Douglas Rushkoff. He only wrote the foreward.  The book doesn't have a lot of useful content. It mostly lists supposed marketing innovations and data mining techniques with large neon graphics (like WIRED magazine circa 1999) and minimal analysis. Its aim seems only to scare you in a conspiratorial tone: you are being watched! your every move is being analyzed!  Too bad it accepts the claims of the companies trying to market these surveillance and date mining systems at face value. Without finding out whether they actually work, you are likely just scaring yourself for no reason 
 I'm a native of Chicago, where the Art Institute has the largest collection of French Impressionism outside of Paris.  So I've seen many of the originals of the works in this book.  I'm also a photographer, so I have a critical eye, and I know how hard it is to get a good reproduction in a book of a work of art.  Nonetheless, this book contains some of the worst prints I've seen.  The colors are flat and lifeless and the shadows are clipped, which has blocked up the blacks and therefore ruined the contrast.    There's lot of in-depth information on the history of the art form.  But visually it's a stinker.  If you've never seen the magnificent work of the impressionists, this book will NOT ignite your interest in this genre, it's just too poorly printed.  
 Sorry for the sarcastic title. I've read most of this book. I'm still reading the last chapter which is actually the most hopeful chapter. I'll start with what I liked. Harris lays out some good suggestions on handling the pyhsical aspects of a dating relationship (or courtship if you get caught up in semantics) However, Harris offers nothing else except a rudimentary courtship model that involves physical boundaries and guarding against things moving too quickly. I think this is good wisdom, but the book completely lacks in many other apects of pursuing a relationship. He talks very little about communication skills. Also you won't find much on personality traits or compatibility.  When I began a relationship with my girlfriend I read this book. I don't regret reading it, but it lacks in a lot of areas. Part of this is due to the fact that I don't know what credentials Joshua Harris has to make his claims. He is not a Phd, or a relationship or family counselor. He had two substantial romantic relationships in his life. One with the girl who inspired him to write his first book, and the other with his current wife. When it comes to relationships, I would hardly call Joshua Harris and authority on the subject. He has no more experience or wisdom that the average person who would pick his book up off the shelf. I support the crux of what Harris talks about. I respect the fact that him and his wife Shannon waited to their wedding day for their first kiss. The book is chivalrous and romantic. It is a hopeful book.  But it paints only a partial picture of how to persue a relationship. If you are into reading relationship books, just be sure this isn't your only resource. 
 The city of Fort Myers, FL is disparraged in this book as a menagerie of NASCAR fans and strip clubs. Anyone who's spent time in Fort Myers knows that there aren't many strip clubs and the ones that are here aren't a big part of the local scene (what to do on a random Saturday night) like they are in other parts of Florida, like Tampa, Clearwater, or Miami 
 Although there is much practical advice and interesting facts about child development, the overall result is a tired and dated manual. Some of the advice is downright dangerous!  The book explored the conflict between putting infants to sleep on their back as opposed stomach. There is a  clinically accepted link between Babies sleeping on their stomach and SIDS,  Sudden Infant Death Syndrom. There isn't a pediatrition or health nurse on  the planet who would recomend putiing an infant to sleep on their belly, let  alone give an option between the two 
 I bought the Explorist which I am generally happy with, but this software is lousy and there is no product support for it on the website.  The version I have 2.0 has not been updated to work well with the Explorist, and the 64MB limitation is a pain when you have a 512MB SD card.  In general, the routing works but the interface is nowhere near as good as Streets and Trips 
 ..and being that this movie is close to twenty years old makes it possible. The book passed through several hands as a film property and eventually ended up in those of Wes Craven. His name was most certainly at the forefront of horror directors. The result: ugly stereotypes, anorexic socio-political allegory, scant scares, and Bill Pullman - that's "The Serpent and the Rainbow" in a nutshell. Based on Wade Davis' novel, Wes Craven's lame documentary-flavored horror story follows anthropologist Dennis Alan (Pullman) as he searches revolutionary Haiti for a mystery drug that reportedly raises the dead. With the help of a local psychiatric institution doctor (Mona Lisa's Cathy Tyson), Alan undergoes a crash coarse in the island's history, discovering a culture where 110 percent of the population practices voodoo, including an evil political leader (Zakes Mokae) who's using zombifying white powder as a means of silencing opponents. Imagery of people being buried alive is the film's calling card, and Craven handles his suffocating coffin-encased dream sequences with sufficient skill. Yet in every other respect, the film is either offensive or incompetent, from the sight of blacks behaving like superstitious witch doctors or the dance floor-gyrating possessed, to Pullman's unbearably overwrought performance as the altruistic Alan, to the persistently aggravating narration, which wants to function as helpful connective tissue between scenes but instead only provides a wealth of superfluous information that neither complements nor amplifies the already dull, pointless action.  I have seen this movie twice in my life and if its one thing "Serpent And The Rainbow" is, it's stylish. Filmed in my homeland, the movie is loaded with colorful scenery. There's tons of unforgettable religious imagery (due in no small part to the colorful nature of voodoo) as well as lots of great scenes in Haitian graveyards that stick in the brain. There's also tons of Craven-style shots (the nightmare sequences reminded me immensely of Cravens previous works) as well as some bits that came out rather nicely (the shot of a man inside the coffin being lowered into the ground). Performances are decent, especially Zakes Mokae, who plays Peytraud with subtly psychotic menace. Pullman is as wooden as ever (how does this guy keep his job?) delivering lines right from that invisible teleprompter hanging about six inches from his nose.  I also question the "based on a true story" factor: people tearing their own head off and tossing them isn't true to life. Hollywood, at times, loves to pick on voodoo given its "minority" status among the faiths and treat it a bit backwards. In reality Voodoo is not based on evil premises as is often portrayed, but instead has it's foundation in Catholicism. The Spirits that are such cornerstones of Voodoo are, in effect, angels with God and Jesus reigning supreme over all. And, there is a dark side. It is the dark side where the elements of control over others and evil show themselves, and this dark world of evil Voodoo is indeed scary. The trouble is, when making a movie with Voodoo elements it takes time and effort to explain the reality of the practice...and it is much easier to just rely on the frightening stereotypes instead. But in this film Craven explores voodoo on a rather scientific level. Although many of the events depicted are still mystic, they are always rational, and if they actually venture into the realms of the supernatural, Craven makes sure the viewer understands that voodoo has also very much to do with mental states and hallucinations inseparably embedded in the Haitian culture. This movie could have been so much better if Craven would have learned that the scariest things often have nothing to do with special effects but the root of all. Recommending this film probably wouldn't be very wise in my part but reading the book is highly beneficial.  
 I was expecting a lot from this book, and I certainly walked away feeling disappointed.  Jayna Davis comes off as something of a literal Michael Moore for the right here.  I say that because much like Moore used his film to ambiguously blame the 9/11 attacks on Saudi Arabia, Ms. Davis seems to be insinuating that Saddam Hussein was responsible for this attack.    First, yes, there is much more to this story than has been told to us.  John Doe number 2 is a legit question and the evidence does seem to indicate that he may have been a former Iraqi who was brought over to America by the first President Bush (along with many others).  But that does not mean that he, or anyone involved in the bombing, was funded or linked to Saddam (or Al Qaeda).    A things to take into consideration: I've read a few of the previous reviews that seem to indicate that because there are endorsements from former CIA director R. James Woolsey and Reagan DOD official Frank Gaffney, this makes the book completely legit.  Not quite.  Woolsey and Gaffney have become two of the loudest underground neoconservative voices of the last few years.  Woolsey also endorsed "A Study of Revenge" which pins the first WTC bombing on Hussein.  Clearly, he's more interested in justifying the war started by his peers than helping the American people find the truth.   Further, since these are two people who have the ears of the White House (especially the VP), why wouldn't this have been used to justify the second Gulf War if the evidence is so strong linking Saddam to this attack??  It certainly would have helped make the case, and given the American people a solid reason for taking the man out.  Considering that this adminstration has no problem playing fast and loose with the facts, I would imagine they would have run with this premise, even if they have minor doubts.    Personally, I don't believe Saddam had the ability to pull something like this off.  Throughout the 90's he was heavily contained and monitored.  I can't see him pulling off an attack like this (or the first WTC).    Still, this book raises some important questions that remain unanswered to this day.  And those questions should continue to be asked, just as many questions about 9/11 persist.  But raving endorsements from Glenn Beck, Woolsey and Gaffney actually hurt the credibility of this book rather than help it. 
 Like some of the other reviewers I cannot say that this is an interesting book. I have read many New Age books, many of them quite scholarly. This is just not a good book. Sorry, Mr. Taylor -- better luck in the next life,  eh 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well.I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 I absolutely loved Wren to the Rescue.  I picked it up in third grade, and haven't come across many books that willl eat it.  HOWEVER, I was REALLY disapointed in this one.  Connor's charachter undergoes a very BIG change,  and many other details also mysteriosly changed.  This goes also for Wren's  War.  Yes the plot was okay, but I think she could have put more heart and  thought into this book.     I also thought it was alot like her first Wren  book.  Tyron was turned into a dog, and Wren a fish.  Hmmmm. Sound  familiar?  I think Sherwood Smith could have come up with new and different  ways to incorporate majic in her books 
 If I Could See What You See? What would I see? A big, fat bank account maybe? If I could see what you could see while looking in the mirror I'd see a bloated, fat pig with a bad haircut and an unsightly gut. I'd see a gluttonous turd, a sham artist with no credentials or talents. I'd see some white trash Long Island ex-house wife wearing a bed sheet as a muumuu. Conning people into thinking you're talking to ghosts is arguably the lamest and least-talented form of scamming known to man. Even the snake oil salesmen of the world are embarrassed to have you included in their ilk. If you could see what I see you'd off yourself 
 I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations 
 ....and it was true love. Shudder. I really expected the best from this book. The premise was so great, but the execution was so terribly awful. Mona, the main character was poorly fleshed out, and, while I truly felt sad for the tragedy in her past, I found that she was so consistently disengaged from her own life, that I could not empathize like I wanted to. I had hoped that with the word "reinventing" in the title, I would see some sort of cathartic metamorphosis in her character, but she seemed to stay the same. I thought that at the very least, I would get detailed accounts of her physical makeover, fashion choices, and lifestyle changes, but felt that there were many missed opportunities to add color to the story. I hated the F-bombs dropped so frequently by more than just the main character. Come on, puhleease, write me a real dialogue! Put some effort into it! A steady stream of obscenities is just a signal to me that I, the reader, was not worth the effort.  As for the Mike, the male lead, so to speak, he simply came across as a misogynist of the highest degree. Having Mona keep saying that "there was more to him than that" did not make it apparent to my mind. I could not see what either saw in each other. She came across as seriously whacked and manipulative, and he was absolutely the worst the male world could possibly offer, an insult to men everywhere. Stereotypes and cliches abounded. It was a wasted opportunity for the author, and a waste of my time. Sorry. 
 When I finished my classical training, I picked up this book with enthusiasm and have been working with it on & off for 2 years. Levine wrote a book that was sorely needed in music education, but I am anticipating another edition since I have severe criticisms of the book that are probably more the fault of Levine's editors than his.   Firstly, there are too many musical examples in this book. It would be better to stick to a handful of artists to demonstrate a lot of points. Levine frequently goes off into tangents of just listing artists . The book could have been cut in half because of this and more time devoted to explaining concepts. Secondly, the book is written in a conversational style which often makes it difficult to follow because written and spoken word are two different entities.  Thirdly, the book is overwhelming because of the first reason I mentioned as well as some of the chapters are huge. Ch. 3 should have been 3 seperate chapters.  Fourthly, Levine needs to work with his editors in finding a better way to present the core concepts, especially in Pt. 1, I found myself scratching my head sometimes trying to figure out just what Levine was getting at even though I understand harmony well. It is often on the tip of Levine's tongue and he doesn't lay it out for his reader. Finally, only half of the page is printed on. Sher Music Publishing could have used the entire page and reduced the price of the book. This isn't related to the actual content of the book, but if your a student tight on money, this is significant.  The fundamental question for any jazz theory book is this: what distinguishes jazz from other types of music? Improvisation is not a sufficient answer since Jazz has some serious rules just as any human language does. Levine still needs to better synthesize his knowledge so it is more accesible to his readers. After reading his book, I still feel that I need to go to another book to find more information 
 This book is about Dave's late high school years, while he was in the foster care system.  This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times.  I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe.  But the book turned out to be more of a "guy" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends.  This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting.  The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much.  The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times.  As a result, the book became a little boring.  I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across.  About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review.  The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers.    Secondly, I did not like the book.  Plain and simple.  That is OK.  Not every book jives with everybody.  I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring.  I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus.  You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you.  I am free to express my opinions on these books.  And yes, I read "Lost Boy", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life.  You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me.  So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers.  I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it.  I'm sure I'll lose helpful votes on what I've just said to "Gingerwoman", but it's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other 
 First, know this, it is a trimmer not a shaver!  With the included height attachment, your bound to have a little fuzz still left.  Without the attachment, you get closer results, but still very visible hair lines.  I am quite disapointed with the product, because it runs on two AAA batteries, the motor is nearly powerful enought and will lock up sometimes when cutting hair in different angles.  This lock up rips the hair out of your skin and sometimes even cuts you.  I would certainly not recommend this product, but might be necessary if you'll be traveling and need a small portable trimmer that will get more results than just letting your hair grow wild.   
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 If a person constantly predicts a bear market over a period of years, eventually he will prove right, since, as we all know, bull markets do not last forever, and bear markets are regular features of the stock market landscape. However, it is not enough simply to predict a bear market, one must predict a bear market at the right time. A prediction of a bear market during the early and mid 1990s (and there were many) would not be particularly helpful, since the bull continued to 2000. The same applies here to Mauldin. Mauldin predicted a bear market in 2004. He was wrong. A consistent bull market lasted from early 2003 until early 2006. The market has turned down since May of 2006, but as of this writing (Aug. 3), the market is still up significantly for the year. If you listened to John Mauldin's advice, you would have missed the bull market of 2004, 2005, and early 2006, especially in small-mid caps and foreign markets.   According to John Mauldin, bull and bear markets always last approximately 7-15 years. The facts do not support this conclusion. A bear market lasts for as long as it continues, and no longer. The bear market of 2000-2003 lasted only 3 years. Now according to Mauldin, the bull market of 2003-2006 is simply a "bear rally." But three plus years of positive returns cannot be so easily dismissed. In practical terms, for investors, you simply cannot afford to sit out a market rally like the 2003-2006 one.    Study after study has shown that the best way to minimize your risk and maximize your returns is to diversify, invest for the long run, and choose your mutual funds and stocks with great care after substantial research. One should not "buy and hold" blindly, but it's been proved that if your investment horizon is 9 years or more, a diversified portfolio of stocks will consistently outperform bonds. Furthermore, it's impossible to time the market successfully on any kind of consistent basis.   Mauldin is in the hedge fund business; hedge funds are designed to produce positive returns during bear markets. So it is in his personal interest to convince people that a bear market is coming. Hedge funds are limited to people with over a million dollars, so they are not exactly a viable solution for average investors. In addition, hedge funds are not the cure-all that Mauldin suggests. In fact, many hedge funds lose money and go out of business. They are, in fact, extremely risky investments, despite Mauldin's claims.   Mauldin believes in a deep value approach to stock picking, which I happen to agree with. Value stocks have lower volatility and tend to outperform the market in the long run. However, they don't do as well as growth stocks during bull markets, as several value fund managers learned during the late 1990s, some of whom even lost their jobs.   The argument Mauldin makes for a coming recession is pretty persuasive although not original. Trade deficits, budget deficits, an aging population, pension and medicare obligations; these all point to increased inflation (the least painful and only politically acceptable way to pay off our obligations) leading to recession and depressed stock prices. With the current market and economic conditions (Aug. 2006), it's time to think about some defensive investment choices: value and high-dividend stocks, and bonds. But we are not in a recession yet, and it's not inevitable. As Mauldin points out, quoting Greenspan, the market is so large and complex that it's essentially impossible to make accurate predictions. And the market is so efficient, that if it were possible to predict the future by any means, that information would be immediately and permanently discounted. 
 it seems that as long as reguritate the dominate social narrative of an oppressed/underpresented group the work is considered a "masterpiece" and "touching". Well this left me cold. How many times does this novel need to be written? there are many ways to create unforgettable characters and working the hell out of tired stereotypes is not one of them.  Also, read something by Julius Lester if you want to see this kind of thing done well 
 I read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn't folow all of it but I read all of it anyway. I wouldn't recommend it. TOO SLOW MOVING, and BORING because of the flashbacks. The movie was the same way 
 Just plain common sense. There wasn't profound thought through out the whole book.  I finished in thirty minutes 
 It usually takes me about a week or two to get through a paperback. I've been  struggling to read this every night in bed for two months. It's boring and uninteresting. I quit 
 I purchased this set, and upon arrival, I found the circular polarizer to be defective.  Amazon quickly replaced the set, and this polarizer did not work either!  I returned the set, as I am not going to waste any more time trying to get a polarizer that works.  I'll pay more, and get a quality product from a different maker.  I will say that Amazon is second to nobody for customer service.  I appreciate that, and will continue to be an Amazon customer.  However, I can't say the same for Tiffen. 
 I'm a huge fan of McGovern, but this book isn't worth the money.  You can actually read the first section of the book - the part I really loved - at his web site for free: www.gerrymcgovern.com.  The "sample web style guide" at the end of the book is woefully underwritten.  Buy CONTENT CRITICAL instead 
 Matthew 24:24 "For there shall arise false Christs, insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect."  I have met Glenda and read her first book, Love Without End, too.  She is sincere in describing her meetings with an amazing spirit of light.  The books are very New Age, and it is difficult to grasp what the point is.  The point is to contradict the Bible teachings of judgment and "the good news" of salvation.  Jesus continues talking in Matthew 24:23&26 - "Then if any man shall say unto you, lo, here is Christ, he is in the secret chambers, believe it not."  And, II Corinthians 11:14 - "for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.&quot 
 He told us what was wrong with current belief-what is the replacement and where is the scientific backing for his view 
 I have to admit that I have not read this book.  I was reading the reviews published here to decided whether or not to read it.  I was amazed at the number of errors in the review by Rudy Avila.  For example, Callas never married Onassis...that's a biggie.  And, who on earth wouldn't know that Jackie Kennedy is usually spelled with an "ie" and not a "y"?  Of course, if he really knew his stuff, he would know that Mrs. Kennedy never referred to herself as "Jackie", preferring the more formal "Jacqueline".  If he got his information from this book, then this book is extremely inaccurate and misleading.  If he is just making stuff up, he should not be writing reviews.  Now that I have gotten myself all worked up over this, I suppose that I will have to read it and write an ACCURATE review when I am done 
 Mr. North broke the law, violated his oath as an officer and dishonored the Marine Corps.  Because of a technicality he 'walked'rather than serve a considerable sentence at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, Ft. Leavenworth and then being subjected to the public humiliation of being drummed out of the Corps before assembled Marines and dishonorably discharged. Much of what is wrong with corporate America was exemplified by Mr. North's behavior.  Shame on all who look up to Mr. North as a hero.  He isn't 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 I love historical novels.  I really like a good romantic tale woven into those stories. For that reason I read and enjoyed "Katherine" by Anya Seton.  I later tried "Green Darkness" and was disappointed... and then tried Seton's "Dragonwyck" and really didn't care for it either. I saw these rave reviews over "Avalon" and decided to try another republished Seton book one last time. People, it is a chore to finish. I am doing so out of a sense of obligation... this book can't hold my interest at all.  The writing is simplistic.  The "romance" is dull.  The story is painfully slow. The characters are FLAT. I just don't get it. There are so many wonderfully written historical romances out there - all I can think is that the reviewers who've raved about it aren't regular readers of this genre and therefore aren't comparing it to other books & authors such as Sharon Kay Penman, Nicole Galland, or even Elizabeth Chadwick (more pure romance set against history than a blend of the two). I just can't recommend this book 
 FIRST let me echo what another reviewer shared in that this is NOT an attack on Jeremy Camp. Nor is it a question of his heart or faith or anything else. Given what he's been through in his life I simply could NOT do that. That said ,it seems to me that this music is rubber stamped CCM.I too was excited when Stay released with the rawness of many of the songs. ESPECIALLY Understand and Take My Life. But have been disappointed with each subsequent release. If,as another reviewer has stated, God is indeed writing these songs, then I need to ask His forgiveness. But He has made us all different and this is just my opinion. IF you like Contemporary Christian Music then this is for you. If you're wanting to rock then I'd continue my search elsewhere 
 I find it much more difficult to navigate this book than, say, Moreland and Fleisher's book of Latin grammar. Furthermore, it's verbosity is frequently difficult to penetrate. The author seems to have an aversion to synthetic explanation, relying instead on an overabundance of examples that serve to clarify little of the readers confusion 
 Hollywood quality controlled by the bottom line? Gee, what an original concept. The question is, does Tinseltown point its checkbook any which way new media outlet winds blow or does it take a moral philosophical stance in a chaotic evil-is-hip era defined by a fantasy video game role playing culture of death?   Do most films today suck because they're only made for kids? And should it not matter because they're an easy target audience? That's a cop out. In the days of old Hollywood, moguls created demand across a wide demographic spectrum. Only advances in home media in the past 30 years have disaffected the issue of quality.    Epstein's new age filmic disorder tome basically applies cold harsh statistical reality to a cultural traffic accident and doesn't make a reasonable value judgment on what's happening. He's too busy dotting his is and crossing his ts with stat data to care. His beef is to say that's the way it is. Tough cookies.  As such, stating the facts and stressing the obvious is not rocket science when the largest demographic of Americans in 40 somethings are left out in the cold in ageist exclusion. Mature adults would rather stay at home because suits have decided only kids are worth making movies for. So they fear good filmmaking.  Any entertainment consumer with a clue is staying away in droves because the current generation of talent have no brains, style, taste or creativity for anything except that which will appeal to the lowest common denominator. And when the dream machine's quality control chicken is its egg, apathy becomes its own vice.  So don't blame the the demise of Americana on the rise of home video. Instead, blame the missing vision and low IQ of modern media decision makers and end users. Generations X and Y rule the roost. At the end of the alphabet, only Z is left. Does this signal our end days? Take in the latest 50 Cent flick to decide.  If we live in a world where movies and music contain no more important civil messages and merely serve as escapist pastime and we experience societal downfall as a result, soon there will be no bottom line to speak of. A show business peddling dreck to kids while good will falls to ruin doesn't deserve to survive.  The only useful thing this book has to say is that corporate entities make most of their profits in direct home DVD sales. So if you're making a movie, bypass bohemian green lighters who set the substandards and go straight to digital video. Not only is quality old hat these days. Film itself is an endangered species 
 In another rehashed treatise on Savage's perverted sense of truth, he sells a miserable, peripatetic screed to his lemming-like followers.  This man's politics and principles have been condemned by such well-established conservative journals as The Economist.  We all need someone to trust, and for Savage that person is the MD who will prescribe him some thorazine.  Gets 2 stars only because of the book's educational value as an example of the ramblings of a lunatic.  Barry Goldwater must be spinning in his grave 
 	It sounded like an interesting enough YA book. Betsy Balcombe, a resident of St. Helena, returns home from her London boarding school. St. Helena, you might recognize, was one of the islands Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled too. Betsy arrives home only to have Napoleon arrive several days later, and with his lodgings not yet finished, he is sent to live in her guesthouse. A relationship begins between the two, and while I'm pretty sure the author was trying to create a friendship between Betsey and Napoleon, I found it sort of creepy that Napoleon would want a purely platonic friendship with a fourteen year old. Putting that bit aside, the book moved incredibly slowly, and while I kept expecting things to really pick up, they didn't till the very end. By that point, I just wanted to finish 
 Jewel Cases are diffucult to open and are extremely fragile 
       What is remarkable about this onetime best-selling book -- which could well be described as a coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel -- is not that Fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24.  Nope, the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced "The Great Gatsby" a mere five years later.           "This Side of Paradise" is a mess: it is as uneven, affected, feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero, the tiresomely self-conscious young Minnesotan-gone-to-Princeton Amory Blaine.  (One suspects, in fact, that had Fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as Amory's diary the result would have been considerably more readable -- or the book's structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable, at least.)         That the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 -- it was to prove the most popular book, in terms of sales, ever produced by its author -- presumably speaks to the public's recognition of something new and revealing in it.  Okay, Amory Blaine may well have been the original Jazz Age prototype; and the drinking and shameless smooching (etc.) that he and his prep school and Princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably, one can accept, a revelation to see in print (and likely a titillating one) for an American audience raised on McGuffy's Readers -- and ready for some sort of Great Departure after the Great War.  Welp, here it comes:         "On the Triangle trip Amory had come into constant contact with that great current American phenomenon, the `petting party.'        None of the Victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were Victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed."   To the reader at a remove of some 80-plus years this is, of course, very small beer.  What was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now, in the best cases of the Paradise narrative, as unalarming quaintness. While this is not exactly Fitzgerald's "fault", so to speak, it is also true that the use of "shocking revelations" of this type -- scandals specific to a place and time -- represents a risk a writer takes: the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and/or universal in such episodes.  In any event, the price the reader pays here, in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds Amory's adventures in quaintness during the nascent Roaring Twenties, is very, very high for payoffs of such modest proportions.  I mean, come on:   "For years afterward when Amory thought of Eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart.  The night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds, he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore; and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it.  Eleanor was, say, the last time evil crept close to Amory under the mask of beauty, the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes."  Yikes.  I don't care what New Generation you're talking about, can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody?  (Can it represent ANYTHING to anybody?)         There are things to like, even admire, here and there in Paradise.  Fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark (e.g., "They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered." "Sometimes I wish I'd been an Englishman; American life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy." "It's better to leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes; they do it so much better.")  And the political incorrectness of some of the narrator's observations is, in its now-curious way, refreshingly, bracingly funny:   "Slowly and inevitably, yet with a sudden surge at the last, while Amory talked and dreamed [which is about all Amory ever does-MHT], war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where Princeton played.  Every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings.  When Amory went to Washington the next weekend, he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the Pullman car coming back, for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens-Greeks, he guessed, or Russians."  Nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there's a war on, I always say.           Anyway, most of the novel consists of young Amory's elaborate ponderings -- romantic, philosophical and egotistical -- which are as forgivable as they are forgettable.  I've forgotten them already. At some level, in any case, Fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character -- who was, of course, a not-very-disguised version of himself.   For how else, if not as commendably self-deprecating irony, are we to take this observation?   "Amory was in full stride, confident, nervous, and jubilant.  Scurrying back to Minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do, so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him, and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty-six hours."         In the end, in any event, one comes back to the initial Fitzgerald vs. Fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder.  In Paradise almost nothing works: form, content, narrative stance, dialogue, character development, pacing -- you name it, it's a problem.  Yet in Gatsby, five years later, everything works -- everything.  If there is to be a Great American Novel, it will have to supplant Gatsby for the honor.  While it is hard to see how Fitzgerald got from point A to point B, the fact is that he did -- and without point A the journey could not have begun. So while "This Side of Paradise" hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon, it surely deserves our respect, and indeed our gratitude, for what it led to. 
 (Warning, rent this series first to see how you respond to it unless you have watched it previously and know that you like it)! I wasn't just dissapointed after my first viewing of Season 1 of the Legacy, I was looking for a means of disposing of the DVD set!!   I usually feel I can rely on a consensus of opinion of Amazon viewers and ordered the Lagacy (sight unseen) after reading the reviews of other customers.  I know now that when it comes to certain subjects I can not go with the flow.  I am a long time fan of science fiction and horror going back to Forbidden Planet and the old Universal horror movies (Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolf Man, etc.). I also loved the motion picture POLTERGEIST as well as all of the newer horrow movies (HELLRAISER to the BUTTERFLY EFFECT). I am not a "high brow" person and I have adapted to the times making a point of seeing and generally enjoying almost every new horror movie for what I could (except for the slash movies).  This series was embarrasing to watch and I can't believe any self respecting horror movie fan would rate it highly.  The special effects are poorly computer generated, the script is terrible, the characters are pathetic and after five minutes I didn't care what happened to the entire cast.  My son walked out after five minutes and he is a Steven King fan (i.e., not "high brow"). I had to agree with him.  The only thing I can say good about this product is that the price was right for so large a collection of episodes. AMAZON I am not trying to hurt sales, I am trying to help them.  
 I read The New Money Masters after the Market Wizards and the New Market Wizards. When I saw "winning investment strategies of: Soros, Lynch, Rogers, etc etc on the front cover, I immediately bought it. Like any trader who jumps into the market without a plan or thorough study, I lost this trade. Train tried to portrait what's in those masters' minds but he failed. Even worse, his writing skill had been too bad for me to finish reading the whole book. Well, how am I supposed to expect something great from a 379 page book that carries 147 pages of appendix 
 I bought this book expecting to share some fascinating stories and experiences, instead each chapter began a buildup and then suddenly you were left standing there alone wondering what happened where did the story go. Very aggravating, then oh yes, this is by the way, where we were, toodle oo on the next tale, or a portion of it anyway 
 The nail clippers,hairbrush, and comb are great but I did not care for the rest. It would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company 
 This book was clearly for beginners only.  Although the book says "for dummies", you'd really HAVE to be a dummy to get much out of this.  The book is simply too vague when talking about important internet concepts and doen't show you how to REALLY get an online business going.  I personally would reccomend 33 Days to Profits by Yank Silver  www.33daystoprofits.com as a much better way to get PRACTICAL advice on starting an online business 
 Once again Catherine Coulter has written a very stupid book!  I could not believe she could actually call this a love story. If I want to read porn books, I would go to the adult shop. I hate the explicit sex scenes in her  books. I am looking for love, not lust. And then to have an uncle who would  treat a neice this way, like a sex object, come on Catherine. I hate her  books and have read quite a few, almost all hoping for a good one. Well  there have been maybe 2 out of the 100 or so she's written. Jade Star was  my favorite. She is drawn out and boring in most of her books,and she  always overuses words.Can't she come up with any new ones? Don't bother  with this one girls, yuk 
 This audio CD had me excited at first, at least until I actually played it. It's the most boring read of any story I've ever heard in my life. Golding's a great writer, but he ain't no reader. His own commentary in parts is distracting and irritating. His mouth noises unsettle me, and his slow, dull, expressionless rendering of this classaic grates on the spirit. Too bad an accomplished reader such as Roger Dressler or Garrick Hagon can't do this novel justice. It's just a damned shame is all 
 What a complete waste of time.  If you just have to see what this volume has to offer, save your hard earned money and get it from the library.  As other reviewers have noted, it only has info on the 50 states and a few Canadian provinces.  Not only that, but after reviewing cities listed that I have lived in or spent much time in, there was incorrect and misleading info.  I wouldn't dare trust this as reference.  Do yourself a favor and just get a guidebook to the location and check out the local websites as well.  
 I'm a life-long Giants fan and a student of the game. Rozelle was a terrific commissioner especially because of all the events that happened on his watch. I always regretted that he never wrote about it. This book opens the door to his tenure. Unfortunately, it is far to santized to offer the real story of Al Davis, the AFL, JFK's death and the decision to play, the Hornong and Karas suspensions, race, drugs, the USFL, etc., etc. Hoprfully that book is still to be written 
 In the chapter about South Asia, the authors have written quite a lot about the "Kashmir problem" but not once have they mentioned the ethnic cleasing of 350,000 Kashmiri Hindus that took place in 1990. I just cannot believe that they don't know about this 
 I think if you're going to be a self-respecting zombie, you'd much prefer the ability to buy canned baby brains from the delicacy store than bite it out of a living human. I mean ... you're tired, your muscles feel like sweat socks and you don't just suddenly get this urge to gnaw on living bodies. So that's why I was so excited when I saw the zombies heading to the mall. Hell, yeah, they got baby in a can, right? Wrong! This is just some sick excuse to hire your special effects pot buddy who took everything Black Sabbath sung about literally. Think about it, George Romero -- in his sick, twisted way -- is merely editorializing that we should kill all those who have AIDS, just line 'em up in a row and pick 'em off like bottles on a fence. As if they're going around and biting peole to infect everybody. Maybe George just plain hates zombies 
 Sent as a gift.   Althought I thought I had type in a message to go with it they didn't even know who sent it!!!   Thanks 
 After extensive research on grains and nutrition, our family added Amaranth to our staple diet. There's not a wide range of suppliers for Amaranth and we started purchasing Bob's Red Mill Amaranth. Well, to be honest, our experience with this product is that it's been of pretty poor quality. Out of 8 packages we've bought so far, we've had to return 3 to the outlet we purchased them from due to the amaranth being mouldy. And I mean "open the package and you can smell that it's off right away" mouldy. In addition, one of the packages didn't smell mouldy but after we'd cooked it and added it to the baby food we were making, the mouldy smell of the cooked amaranth was very noticeable. Not good, particularly as we're using the amaranth for making baby food for our toddler and mouldy grain is not really something you want to include in the ankle-biter's diet.  In addition, we found we have to hand pick stones, grit and dirt from each package very very carefully. Seems that they are included as a bonus. (Note that as the grain itself is very small, the stones, dirt and grit are very small too - but big enough to damage teeth if they slip  through the cleaning process - particularly toddler teeth). This cleaning and sorting process involves a lot of work, which we wouldn't mind so much if the amaranth was consistently good quality, but it hasn't been.  I have to say that while, after our research, we'd recommend inclusion of amaranth in anyone's diet, Bob's Red Mill Amaranth Grain is NOT a product we would recommend. If you have no choice but this, be very careful about cleaning it and hand picking stone, dirt & grit out before you use it, and make sure you check very carefully for evidence of mould both before and after cooking. In addition, I'd recommend checking with the retailer that they will refund you the purchase price if the product you bought is off. So far, we've been sucessful in getting our money refunded (when we had the receipt - we didn't once and we didn't get the money back that time, but that was the first time and after that we were poorer but wiser.... 
 The photograph for this product is VERY misleading! I thought I would receive 4 soaps as shown in the photo, but I only got one and I didn't even get to choose which dinosaur I wanted inside. The soap itself is very sticky and feels homemade. Homemade isn't necessarily a bad thing except here I'm not sure whether I can trust the ingredients, especially since the soap is really not very pleasant smelling. 
 This book provides an intriguing look back at a time when the Dot Com Boom was at its zenith, shortly before the crash. Interestingly, there is no sense of the impending doom that lies just over the horizon.  Lewis' "Liar's Poker" was extremely enjoyable, particularly because of the flash and personality of the central players. In this book, Lewis seems to have lost his way as he tries to wring interest from a much less compelling or likable chief character. The tone of the book is further weakened by the constant labels applied to Clark's disciples as the "smartest," "best," "greatest," and "most ingenious," individuals in their various fields.  What strains credibility, however, is the attribution of all Clark's successes to his incredible intelligence and foresight, while the fault of his failures is cast on the incompetent actions and short-sighted beliefs of others. History will probably not judge Clark as charitably as Lewis -- especially since most of the Clark's companies have either failed outright or remain but shells of their Dot Com era glory (most notably SGI, Netscape, and Healtheon).  Throughout the book, Jim Clark is touted for wealth that amounts to between $3 and $4 billion. The list of 2004 Forbes 400 Richest in America shows Jim Clark with an approximated net worth of $700 million. For a man who brags he will quit making money when his fortune eclipses that of Oracle's Larry Ellison, today Clark probably most regrets the loss of his favorite designation: billionaire.  
 I got this book to affirm my choice to be a stay at home mom.  I am so blessed that I can stay home, but sometimes the drudgery gets to me...as it does so many other moms/housewives.  I wanted to try to focus on the blessings of being home and taking care of my family, instead of the negatives.  This book has some very good information to offer, but the author can be very crude and negative.  Some of the words she uses really turned me off, and I ended up putting the book away because of it.  I get it back out sometimes if I need a little pick me up, but I try to focus on the good parts and skim over the bad.  Overall, I would not recommend this book.  One that is full of the positives about being a mom without the negatives is "The Momstown Guide to Getting it All".  Would definitely recommend that one over this one 
 Brian Goodwin's book might be worth reading from the perspective that it brings a voice to a little-heard structuralist perspective on evolution.   As a biologist myself, though, I have to say that Goodwin misses the mark.  Goodwin's knowledge of Darwinian theory is inadequate to critique it, and his knowledge of genetics abyssmal.    Goodwin's central thesis is that organisms adapt out of a structural interaction with the environment.  Sort of like a crystal forming on an icy window.  Interesting idea, and perhaps with some developmental relevance, but the simple fact that two genetically different organisms placed in an identical environment (an experiment that has been repeated ad naseum since the invention of genetics) are observed to develop differently pretty much lays ruin to Goodwin's thesis.   Readers who are not scientists should know that Goodwin's ideas are tin-foil-hat fringe and lacking in both empirical support and in any demonstration that they lead to a productive research program.  This is not a book to read if you wish to learn anything about evolutionary science.   It is a book to read if you'd like a novel- if not entirely sane- view on biological change. 
 King certainly lends a high-profile to this collection of latter-day noir writing and tough-guy procedurals, but I believe he created something a little too far outside the readership's expected genre for this series. The setting and characters are recognizable (now trite?) staples of his beloved Maine coast, and he works at bringing their "down east" mannerisms to life with language that rings of "Bert & I" lobstermen. I wasn't particularly caught up in the aged newspapermen's tale of their quest to identify a mysterious dead man found on the local beach. And the ending ... well, um ... the ending is definitely an open-ender. King cleverly covers himself by adding a disclaimer of sorts that the story won't appeal to many readers. Yep. You got that right, Stephen. No gunplay, no boozers, no saucy dames, no double-crosses, no slangy patter, no real satisfaction for me. I suggest Hard Crime afficionados skip this entry and look to some of the heavy-hitters from the past 
 I had to quit reading half-way through. The man uses many  Biblical references, but most out of context and with his own personal interpretations. He claims the Bible does not teach of the Holy Trinity, yet--though the actual word "trinity" is not used in the Bible (to my knowledge)--there are many references to God being three-in-one and a mystery to us all. The author claims to answer all the questions of the universe, but seems to go round-and-round in circles and never get to the point. If you need something good to smirk at, read this Mystery of the Ages. But if you want real answers, stick to the Bible 
 Kashmir Spinach is the third Tasty Bite offering I have tried.   The look and taste is quite unappealing.   We would not consider buying it again.   We had high hopes based on how much we loved other Tasty Bite items we tried, but no luck with this one.  I encourage you to try Agra Peas or Jaipur Vegetables instead, two Tasty Bite items that are really fantastic 
 I think the story wasnt that great.I didnt think it was very good because it was only about mainiac magee running away and him beating every one in all the sports 
 I find this book personally insulting and full of revisionist conclusions. As a Romani who lost Grandmother and many Aunts and Uncles in the Porrajmos (the devouring in Romany)I am outraged that once again we, the victims of this insanity are blamed for the crimes committed against us. That ANY victims of the Holocaust are essentially blamed for their own demise is cruel and unjustified. I also contest, and detest, Mr. Lewy's conclustion that the Roma people were not racially marked for extermination: this is both absurd and untrue as withnessed by the nazi's own words, we were "lives unworthy of life, we were criminals due to our genetics, Germany must be cleansed of the Gypsy plague" etc. An inaccurate book full of racial sterotypes, the gist of which was used by the nazi's as justification for the extermination of the Roma in the first place and is still being used to justify the persecution of Roma today. Horrid book 
 First off, this book is written like someone's thesis paper.  It is full of jargon, buzzwords, and impenetrable language.  I understand what the authors are trying to say in most cases, but while you shouldn't dumb down your writing there is much to be said about simplicity and clarity.  As the saying goes, don't use a two dollar word when a 10 cent word is just as good.  Secondly, I find several of their conclusions highly debatable, or even if I agree with the conclusion it doesn't seem well supported.  In particular, the author's opinion of what constitutes "denial" of one's racial heritage isn't well defined, and the link between this denial and an "unhealthy" image isn't well established.    Third, many of the case studies are so lacking in detail that their usefulness as examples is highly limited.  The teacher who is being "unintentionally racist" when she tries to put a child in a reading program is a good example.  Was this actually an example of a teacher treating a biracial child as an inferior, or was it an example of an overly sensitive mother over ruling a professional teacher?  Another example is the young man who appears white, was raised by white parents, but in fact had a mixed race parentage.  His case is called "unhealthy" because of "denial", which may or may not be true based on the very limited data we are given.  I argue that true or not, these examples and others don't support the main arguments very well.  Each chapter ends with a detailed list of sources, but I didn't buy this book as a reading guide.  Finally, I have an issue with the title.  This title makes it sound like a "how to" guide, when in fact there are very few suggestions on how to raise a biracial child as opposed to a single race child, and what little advice they give runs the gamut from common sense suggestions to extremely vague instructions.  Maybe I was expecting too much, but most of the books on the subject are children's books.  I need something that tells me what to say when my baby's god sister asks why my baby is white but her mom is black.  I usually go into genetics and evolutionary theory, but a 5 year old sometimes has trouble with those concepts.   A similiar book, but better researched, is "The Interacial Experiance" by Brown.  It also is very academic, but the author does a better job of supporting her arguments, and it is an easier read.  
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 This is a good easy to read book.  It is filled with many excellent stories.  It is not a how to shoot or what gun should I buy book 
 I am a big Tom Russell fan and purchased this CD on faith.  Artists certainly are free to record whatever they like, but for me the true test of a CD is how it stands the test of time, how many times will it be played?  For me, once was enough. Buy any other Tom Russell CD and you will be pleased.  To call this a sequel to the great "The Man from God Knows Where" is misleading at best.  I look forward to the next "music" CD from Tom 
 Some interesting thoughts, but not at all like real astral travel, and don't get this if you expect to learn astral travel, or progress already existing projection talent.  look into adventures beyond the body by  william buhlman (spelling may be wrong) if you want to begin astral travel 
 Mr. "Dow 36,000" wants you to believe him this time.  No, really, he means it.  Right.  In 2005 he he wrote an article denying that there was a housing mania about to go bust.  I think that's a pretty good indication that there is a housing mania about to go bust.  This guy is amazing 
 Certainly not AC/DC - this is a quick cash-in record. On this soundtrack to Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive, we get three crappy new songs (Title track, instrumentals D.T. and Chase the Ace), as well as a selection of songs that can be found elsewhere: the even-worse Sink the Pink and Shake Your Foundations (Both off of Fly on the Wall) as well as a few older, much-better AC/DC tunes (Ride On, You Shook Me All Night Long, Hells Bells, For Those About to Rock) that are best heard on their original albums (yes, this is worse than For Those About to Rock). And I know that this is supposed to be a pseudo-compilation. In that case, more from the Bon Scott era would be necessary. Avoid. 
 The Reason why you will find that there is no explanation or history behind the magic, as all of the previous reviewers have been stating, is because gypsyies cant really tell fortunes or do magic! I'm a real Gypsy girl born to gypsy parents and I know all of the customs, etc. One of the things people should know about gypsies is that they make their money off of gadje (non gypsies) and off the system, bascially scamming wherever they can. If indeed this woman who wrote this book is really a gypsy, than anyone who bought this book just got scammed, and this woman is probably sitting at home counting her money thinking how she just scammed a bunch of gadje and profitted off of the idea that people really think gypsies can tell fortune and curse people. 
 Like astrology itself, this book is nothing but obfuscating poppycock. Ugh. Read Sagan's "The Demon-Haunted World" instead and get a real education 
 Wow, what a disappointment. Great actors with a god-awful script from a fantastic book. I loved the book so much, I just couldn't wait to see the movie and I missed it theaters so I watched it this weekend from Netflix. What can I say? It's BORING! I'm not a huge fan of Tom Hanks, especially with this mullet-esque hair (it's ok to hate me), but I love Iam McCellan and Jean Reno, but these great actors just couldn't save this movie. And Sofie Neveau was SO much more interesting in the book. Don't waste your time on this one 
 I just passed the California Brokers Examination on my first try. I am an attorney and have no real estate background and I do not have a real estate sales license.  (In fact I hated Real Property in law school and avoid practicing in this area.)  I read a few primer books including this one to see what would be on the exam.  I read this Barron's book all the way through and answered all of the test questions.  I the took the Real Estate Trainers Course in Santa Ana, on the advise of a girlfriend who is a broker and who took their course. They offer a crash courses in LA, Orange County and in Northern Cal. I took the course, read the big book they give you; did all of the exam questions (Over 1500); attended the crash course seminar twice and took the test.  The courses and practice exams Real Estate Trainers gave, made the test easy.  When I took the Real Estate Trainer's Course I realized that this Barrons book is only good to lay out the general areas that are on the actual test.  However, you can not use this book alone to the pass the test.  The questions in this book are too easy and don't reflect how hard the questions actually are.  You can use it for general information purposes only but some of the areas in the Barron's book overemphasis areas that the actual test spends little or no time on.   In that the pass rate for the exam is between 30 and 38%, I would prepare the best you can.  Save your money and find this book in the local library and check it out.  (Many libraries have it.)  Read and take a brokers exam course 
 I was tempted to toss this book into the trash after reading the first two paragraphs that pronounced God dead and the character Anna master, oh, excuse me, mistress of the earth.  But then I begin to wonder just what kind of point was this author trying to make. I forced myself to trudge forward with the novel and found the story line and characters quite novel.  But too many times shivers ran down my back as the author pronounced, through the heroine, Anna, her hatred of people, especially those who believe in God.  How can anyone who cares so much for plants and animals wish for "an Old Testament God to visit the peak with one of His famous scourges: a lightning storm that would blast the rock clean of cloying humanity".. 
 This was one of the worst group performances I have ever seen! Unbelievable that Disney has financed this "Hack Act". And the tread has only started with other weak talented groups coming out of Disney. Save your money for a better movie 
 It is funny reading the five-star reviewers. They have the least amount of knowledge in the field of classics, and yet they can make claims like the "Greeks learned everything in the science from the Egyptians who had mastered all of science first". Really? As I classics major myself who studied both the Greek as well as the Near Eastern histories I can assert that Greece absorbed very little from Egypt; and moreover, Greeks via the Hellenistic Empire of Alexander influenced Egypt far more. Bernal claims that the period of Egyptian involvment in Greece was during the proto-greek stage of the Myceneans, and the dark age that soon followed, which by the way is the most inconclusive period in Greek history. Yet, Bernal, a "scholar" not even trained in the Classics, can claim that this is obviosly because of western ignorance and rascism, that chooses to hide this shameful history. He claims that the Hyskos were a semitic people that invaded the Aegean region in time lending the Greeks their culture etc. First, the Hyskos where a minor group who are only mentioned in respect to Israelite history as they both are said to have entered Egypt at the same time. Bernal leaves out the fact that Egypt and the entire Levant was invaded by "Sea People" who originated form Ionia and the Aegean Islands and were the remnant of the Mycenean Age Homer wrote about. These Sea People devestated Egypt and the Levant, and actually forged colonies. The Egyptians named them the Peleset, who later are known as the Philistines. However they are Myceneans.  Further, Egypt was a theocracy with very little to offer the world in the sciences. The great breakthroughs came in the Classical and Hellenistic Age where Astronomy and Calculus flourished to name a few. Prior to this period the only other notable contributions came from the Babylonians in Mesopotamia.  Furthermore, SEMITIC PEOPLE ARE CAUCASIAN AS WELL.  Meaning Babylonians, Assyrians, Hebrews, Hyskos, Sumerians, and most likely Egyptians, a fact that can be seen in the present day inhabitants. While Arabic has been absorbed, this does not mean the aboriginal inhabitants have been erased. Furthermore, Bernal claims these eurocentric view is centered on a Greco-Roman model of western civilization; however western scholars are first to point out the contributions of other middle eastern peoples, like the the Mesopotamians, the Hittite, and the Persian. The latter two spoke indo-european by the way, in the midst of the so-called "black" semitic language he so readily attempts to usurp. In fact the word Arryan is the derived from the word Iran, as it literally mean the "land of the Arryans". Caucasians do not dwell soley in western Europe; in fact it might be better for these Afrocentric revisionists to expand their propaganda to calibrate for the entire Caucasian world which stretches into a Eurasian model going as far as the Russian steppes and Iranian peripheries.  Furthemore, this idea of Egypt as black is derived on the  premise of non-european otherness, where because someone is not European it automatically means they are not white, and because they are not white that natuarally means they fall into the black camp. The whole train of though is ludicrous.  
 As another earlier reviewer appropriately stated, this book is not for a Classics Scholar. Having read a large number of different translations of the Aeneid and having translated about 80% of the text from the original Latin myself, Fitzgerald's translation here is lacking in many aspects. He does not keep with the same lines as the original text, he takes great liberties in the use of various words, and sometimes his grammatical poetics is overly drammatic for the section of translation. While the Aeneid is a poem, one must consider that an Epic poem is not a Haiku.  If you're looking for an English translation to use in conjunction with a Aeneid translation course, seek another book. I prefered David West's translation when I was taking a few courses in college.  The Aeneid is a wonderful story, just don't read Fitzgerald's translation of it 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 This was the first and last Iris Johansen book I will read. I thought oh I need something to do at work since its going to be slow today (I work in a library). So I broght it with me and it was so boring I actually fell asleep! I will not be finishing this book. It has no substance. I do not recommend it to anyone. It is a waste of time and money. Although if your looking to take a nap then go ahead and read it 
 I didn't like this video for several reasons.  The rubber band is a waste of time and hurts your hands.  I was looking for an aerobic video.  I have Gilad - Bodies in Motion which is great but was getting bored with it since I had it for four years. Let me just say I'm sticking with Gilad because Denise does nothing for me.  You don't even feel like you had a workout with her.  She's boring.  I would recommend Gilad for aerobics and Tamilee Webb for toning.  Tamilee is awesome.   I have many of her videos and I'm a true fan of hers 
 This cd has music that seesaws between pretty and pretty boring...but then you get to the song "Hymn". It is a drop dead, completely gorgeous and jubilant piece of work. As much as the other songs are unimportant, nothing, boring, stereotypcial, new age, synthesizer,  schmaltz, "hymn makes the whole purchase totally worthwhile.   The song is that beautiful 
 Note that in my previous review, in which I commented on the dreadful DVD  transfer, I was only referring to the "That Touch of Mink" DVD.  The Father Goose DVD is not that bad 
 Don't waste your money on this book. I will finish the book because it is our book club choice. The characters are shallow and  self centered. The writing is middle school quality. Kris Radish seems to have an agenda she is pushing and she was going to get it all into this book come hell or high water. No poetry and no beauty, I could care less about the women in this book. Who could possibly think life's problems could be solved by walking away from them while drinking lots of wine? I treasure my sisters and women friends but I wouldn't want to be a friend to any of these women. I would give it no stars if I could 
 This product is worthless. Save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else.   I've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank. I'm really surprised that Amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in 
 This book is revealing a Typical Young Earth Creationism (YEC).  These people have a good and great zeal to defend the Christian Faith.  I commend them for that.  But I must say in a loving way that their method is UNSCIENTIFIC.  It is misleading and untruthful.  We cannot defend truth by using part-truth.  Either way, this is still lying!  How can anyone defend a good cause with bad tools?  This will destroy the Christian witness of the gospel.    As a theologian and Scientist I must refute the young earth creationist movement.  Many Christian Leaders and Theologians are opposing young earth creationism because of their lies.  The scientist community (including Christian scientists) rejects the kind of pseudoscience promoted and distributed by YEC.  Today, the evidence against Young Earth Creationism (YEC) continues to accumulate. This leads inevitably to a general conclusion against all Christianity. I am so grieved when I see atheists laughing at the kind of science that is propagated by YEC. Christ's name is being hurt. Why do young earth creationists have to twist facts and lie so much? Well the answer is simple. They do NOT have ANY evidence in science whatsoever! Then, they have to invent it somehow.   This is how they do it. They Say God created the universe (this is right). By using Usher's Genealogy they believe the Bible says the earth is young. (The Bible does NOT say that) Then they say: "We have to prove what we believe by means of science (after all God created science)". But the Science is not helping them. Then they are forced to dig around to find any flaws in science that they can use and abuse. They continue by accumulating anything they can find to make a case (bits and pieces of unresolved issues, like little discrepancies in scientific data and so on). By using scientific language (and their degrees in science) they go out of their fields of expertise and continue their propaganda by misinterpreting and manipulating scientific data, twisting and ignoring facts, misquoting various writers, using the wrong tools for different kinds of measurements, etc. This is lying. If they find one discrepancy out of, lets say one hundred, they choose to ignore the 99 in order to stress the one that fits their theory. This is NOT integrity. Do you call this science?  By doing sound apologetics we need to bring the unbelieving scientists to faith in Christ.  Unfortunately this kind of YEC propaganda is doing exactly the opposite.  One day they will be held responsible before God.  Zeal is not enough; you need wisdom too.  YEC do not have any!  This is SAD. 
 These headphones have a dececent sound but genuinely no noice cancelling effect.  The battery powers the speakers a bit which does make them a littel louder, but nothing special.  As you see, the price is down to $22.00 which is probably a good price for these (unfortunatly, I bought them at $50.00 and had to return them 
 I love my Microfiber Bath Towel, so I thought that the hair turban would be a perfect compliment to it! I do like how it wraps up my long, thick hair (with room to spare), but I don't think it absorbs the moisture in my hair any more than a fluffy regular towel. Actually, it gets extremely soaked after just a few minutes in the towel. I wouldn't purchase this product again. Instead, I would buy another bath towel and use a hair clip to keep it up 
 I had to use this book for my database management class at Sac State. Only one word can describe this book: horrid. This is the first time I was afraid of failing a class and I beleive that this book had a lot to do with it. It was too difficult to follow and I found myself frustrated and sleepy at the same time. There is just too much information and the examples are not helpful at all. For our final project we had to create SQL statements to query the tables in our Oracle database and during the 12 hours I spent yesterday trying to finish not once was this text helpful. I tried to sell it back too, but apparently no one wants it. Just as well I guess since I might need it again next semester (assuming I don't pass that is). : 
 Cheap! but still useable. Inside had a stained piece of paper/cardboard?... Flimsy leather. Not recommended 
 I originally wrote a relatively favorable review for this book because it seemed to incorporate the best of the original Butler's Lives (a focus on meditating on the life of the saint) and the new calendar of saints (including many recent canonizations).  While it does do the second, I am afraid to say that it is woefully inadequate regarding the first.  In fact, it is probably just as bad as the Atwater/Thurston edition.  For instance, here is part of the section from January 27th on St. Angela Merici: "Accounts of her [St. Angela Merici's] childhood make her pious, rebelling against the fashions of the age, devoted to the legend of St. Ursula, and the recipient of a vision showing a great company of virgins and other saints coming down from heaven to her.  They included a dead sister, who invited her to form a great 'Company of Virgins,' which was what Angela had actually done by the time the account was written."  In other words, the author wants to point out that the story "must" not be true because it wasn't written down until after the alleged vision had been fulfilled.  Now, we are certainly not bound to believe all the accounts in the various lives of the saints, but I do not understand the point of drawing attention to the alleged falsity of a tale in the context of a meditative reading.  If the work seeks to be encyclopedic, it is much too short and you should check on the 12-vol. counterpart, but for a daily meditation (which it seems reasonable to assume such a work is designed to be), such statements are misplaced.  If the story is too absurd to be believed, just don't include it.  As a result, it is disappointing because it would be useful to have a modern Butler's that can be used for a daily devotional or meditation.  Instead, we are left with the old works that do not match the current calendar 
 This text proves that on the internet or in print, a person or persons can create a completely fictional persona and "resume" of qualifications. I recommend searching further for a text with more experienced, polished, knowledgeable authors 
 This book was terrible.  I couldn't believe how bad it was.  It was very out of date and made no sense.  The directions are very hard to follow and it doesn't give nearly enough details.  This didn't work for me at all.  My birdhouses kept falling apart!!!  I would highly suggest another book to replace this one, or better yet, you can have mine because I won't be using it 
 There are as many nights as days, and the one is just as long as the other in the year's course. Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word 'happy' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. -Carl Jung    The story of Bone written by Fae Myenne Ng is a dramatic story that takes place in Chinatown of San Francisco. It is based on the lives of a Chinese American family that has lost the life of a family member. The family is frowned upon because Mah the mother of Ona, Leia, and Nina had 3 daughters. To have a female child is to have bad luck, because they are useless, they show no bravery, they serve no purpose but to have children and they disrespect the families' name. The book touches upon all different aspects of Leia's life in no chronological order, she relives each story through incisive memoirs. You learn that Mah had an affair, with a man and he left her when he knew she was having a daughter. Then she met Leon; Leon worked in the shipping industry and Mah at the baby store. Mah and Leon fell quickly for each other. But when Leon was out at sea she was secretly in love with Tommie Hom. He had hired Mah for her looks, even though she could not sew at all. Tommie taught Mah how to sew beautiful dresses almost as fast as the patterns were printed. She became the best sewing lady Tommie had ever had.  As a kid Ona loved to wait for Leon's ship to come in, she cried for days after he left for sea. She was the type of kid that became emotionally wrapped around anyone she met. Ona loved to be around people all the time, she spent her days at the butcher shop with the owner, and he taught her how to wrap the raw meat to be sold. She also liked to hang out in the laundry room with Leon. One day Tommie Hom decided to hire a women by the name of Rosa she was a lovely woman that Mah quickly become attached to when teaching her how to sew. They became such good friends that Rosa's husband Luc and Leon liked to be in each other's company. When one day they decided to close up the baby shop and open a Laundry Mat in their name. It was a good success but it did not last long. A few months after they opened and all the bills were just being paid off Leon and Mah went in to open up the shop and to their surprise they could not open the door, the lock had been changed. They called Luc but no one would answer. That's when they learned that they had been taken advantage of. Ona had fallen in love with Luc and Rosa's son Osvaldo. Leon was furious with her but the more he hated there relationship the more they fell for each other.  The story touches upon death, Ona whose troubled life ends tragically in early adulthood when she jumped to her death at the top of the Nam because she was prohibited from marrying the man she loved.  The book episodes all different aspects of Leia's life in no consecutive order, she relives each story through incisive memoirs. Through out much of the book you learn about Ona and how the family deals with the guilt. Everyone wonders why she jumped, they ask over and over how they could prevented this, but the family learns in time that your fate is determined by the choices you make. Leia makes her way from feeling guilty to parting the ways between sadness and being truly happy like a ship liner on the open sea. The sea is life and the liner is the awakening.  I believe to get the most out of this book you must look for a deeper meaning. The author is Chinese American and they are traditionally instilled with a form of emotional meanings. While reading this book I realized that I saw what the Leong family endured was incredibly sad and that is had a unfortunate effect on the family. I did not allow myself to become emotionally surrounded by what the Leong family was faced with. They encountered death, and pain, sadness and defeat but they still moved on to support each other and they moved on with life. They learned with every life there is death and with every affliction their will be gallantry.  Fae Myenne Ng describes each moment with descriptive language each sentence takes you to a sidewinding conclusion. In her memoirs you get a strong feeling of deep emotion, from guilt, to love, pain, and grief are completely described in a narrative perspective. The type of memoir used was very serious it gave the story line a very mysterious title. You can tell how Fae pictured Ona, she was like a blossom she was radiant and sweet, full of life and loved. When Ona was stopped from marrying the man she wanted dearly she could not subside from such a cold-hearted decision from the traditional Chinese family.  Birth and Death are the two noblest expressions of bravery. --Kahlil Gibra 
 This book spends far more time telling us what kind of materials are needed and where to buy them/how to use them, than it does "how" to draw manga.  I want to learn what characteristics make a successful manga figure, not how to produce a manga comic book.  I did not feel this book was very useful - there is only one useful page, for example, discussing eyes, and it simply has 4 sets of "boys' eyes" and 4 of "girls' eyes."  I don't consider this a "how to draw" book but rather a "how to get started making manga books with all the appropriate materials."  Give me a black marker and some colored pencils and I'm happy.  This book isn't worth it 
 This movie is just fake snuff. Thats it. Its boring, laughable, and not scary or disturbing in the least. Watch Last House on the Left, now thats scary! 
 We had the Royal for about 8 months, used it sparingly and made sure not to overload it the it stopped working.  We read reviews prior to purchase and it was recommended then to find other reviews now that support our experience.  Stay away from this shredder.   
 I eagerly awaited the release of this book.  Unfortunately, it did very little to live up to expectations.  The book LS1 has much better advise and guidance if you are looking for knowledge in support of your 'mod' appetite 
 Hello All,  Lens hoods are pretty much a necessity, but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood I've ever used. Unlike other hoods that screw on, this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one, and release the clips. This leads to problems of alignment, meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right. Although it's a pain and I hate...I don't really have another alternative. Either go w/o a hood, or take this one. Either way, guess I'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one 
 The item was never received and an email to the seller resulted in no response.  How do I get my money back?  Additionally, this was a X-mas present with an expected delivery date of 12/22/06.  Needless to say it didn't get here in time for X-mas 
 To be sure, this field guide is better than having no field guide.  If birds posed for observation, it would be a great field guide.  But for the real world this guide is disorganized in text and illustrations beyond excuse.  I'm not sure this is the author's fault.  It may be due to the publisher cutting costs.  Still, no excuse.  A birder will pay a premium for a great field guide.  Illustrations are jammed together on each plate with no regard to proportionate size, or to other birds on that plate.  For example, kingfishers are intermixed with trogons, motmots, swallows and woodpeckers on 3 separate plates.  The amazon kingfisher is on one plate; the similar green kingfisher is 2 plates later.  Quick comparison is impossible.  Seven trogons are together on one plate, but the elegant trogon is 2 plates later.  Some woodpeckers are on each of plates 20, 21 & 22; the imperial woodpecker is on plate 45.  First I cried, then I laughed 
 I am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging "palm kernel oil" as an ingredient.  Don't buy anything with palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and anything hydrogenated!!  No matter how many "organic" things are added to it.  For many years now, it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease.  The World Health Organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases. 
 This DVD was probably the stupidest thing I have ever watched.  There is not a shred of science or scientific method anywhere in this production.  The water crystals are pretty ;-) but everything else about this production is complete nonsense 
 there is a handful of writers in the genre of fantasy who actually know what they are doing; creating their own history rather than dabbling in things that can only be described as monstruous fanfiction. sara douglass, however, is neither a good fantasy writer or a dabbler in fanfiction - she's a typist. there is no other excuse for the existence of this series; someome must have seen her at a computer and assumed that she was an author and accidentally given her a book contract - for this is literature at its absolute lowest.  1. random capitalization of names and places and races does not make a book stronger - in fact, it makes it look like it's been written by a mad monkey.  2. the popularization of a traditional hero/anti-hero has been done to exhaustion. the hero/anti-hero in this case is so boring and full of himself that one wishes he'll just jump off a cliff and die already.  3. problematizing a trivial love story into oblivion is NOT a good idea; half of the time the reader will have absolutely no idea of what the author is getting at, and the rest of the time will be spent in annoyance at the trivialities.  this is not literature; it's TYPING, and it is not even good typing. a bland, uninteresting character will not catch my attention by a double-capitalization (StarMan? StarDrifter? TypingAuthorWomanWithComputer?) that most of the time looks like the typist's hands were sliding all over the keyboard. this story is bland, unoriginal, boring and sometimes infuriatingly presumptuous. no reader likes to be treated as a child, yet it is exactly with such an attitude that the author takes on her quite ridiculously thin story.   stay away - or better yet, go read george r r martin. this is not worth your time 
 What I learned in this book could have been placed on 1 page.  Sure, business life is a challenge and your competitors are not your friends, but this book did not deliver on facts and details.  I don't see much difference between this book and the guru-books 
 It sounds like a good system if it worked. You cannot use this system or the indoor camera if you or your neighbors within 300 feet have: a wireless computer network, or a cordless phone (2.4 GHz), or a microwave that is running. I'm not kidding - I can't believe this even passed testing. I think MobiCam has a newer system that you should investigate owning. Those have lots of reviews. Pay attention to them 
 I bought this book because of the review that was listed showing it to be a very good purchase.  Wow was that review wrong...Anyone who has ever read a good revenge book can tell that this book is not worth the paper or  bindings holding it together; very impractical and filled with garbage  stories that either read bad or simply make no sense at all.  I could put a  better book together than this one in 10 minutes and it would have more  revenge tactics than this garbage book lists...I want my money back...make  sure you keep yours and buy a different boo 
 Should you be afraid of your microwave oven? This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, "Have you fed your baby breakfast today?" then you may like this book.   Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love. The other book I highly recommend is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_, which has terrific & reasonable advice you won't find elsewhere. By those two, not this one. 
 This book is an utterly corrupt, crackpot method of lying to others in order to manipulate them, to live under a constant cloud of suspicion, and to essentially ruin your personal relationships.  Shall I give you an example?  From page 122:  "You and a friend are deciding on what movie to see.  You suggest 'Lost In Paradise', but your friend, who doesn't want to see this, offers as evidence a coworker who has already seen it and didn't like it.  you then say 'Oh, well, if no one in your office liked it, I guess it's probably no good.'  If she lets it go at that - not correcting you - then you know she LIED INITIALLY" (emphasis mine).  Excuse me?  What kind of special social retard do you have to be to 'know' your friend is a LIAR because she doesn't want to see a movie?  A little earlier, a technique called "Insert a False Fact" shows up.  INSERT A FALSE FACT?  Isn't that known as LYING?  And this in the context of a party, no less... hoo boy... start lying to everyone at a party because you suspect people of being liars - you're gonna wind up friendless pretty quick.  If you just tell the truth, you'll be amazed at the nice people you meet - who needs a book which rationalizes lying and manipulation?  Trust me, if you have a moral compass, you don't need this rag 
 Either Steven Seagal has absolutely NO self-respect or the Mob were just too damn scary for him when it came to signing the contract for this total pile of crap.   They couldn't even be bothered to come up with an good title. Instead they took Hard to Kill and Out for Justice and combined them (Hard to Justice?). But don't even think for one minute that this film is up to the standards of Seagal's golden years. You'll NEVER see anything worse than this. Well, Son of the Mask maybe.  Seagal plays an archaeologist (well, it's a change from Cop or ex-CIA) who's precious Chinese artifacts and pots are siezed by the Tong (the non-threatening Chinese Syndicate baddies) and stuffed with brown sugar (or cocaine, I don't know). Big Steve stumbles upon this dastardly deed and takes off for the Uzbekistan border. A hundred baddies come out of nowhere and start firing at him.   Big Steve is promptly framed and sent to jail, where he meets a character introduced as his new sidekick but is quickly forgotten about and never seen or heard from again. What the hell was the point in this? It turns out that Steve used to be in the CIA (oh for the love of crumb cake) and was their best ghost thief (huh?) and the DEA release him for some reason and he goes home to his quiet American suburb, where the Tong blow up his wife and house.   Steve goes on a killing spree. But what helps is that every Chinaman who's neck he breaks has a one-word tattoo on his arm that when added up makes an ancient Chinese proverb that provides the right order of tiles to push in case of fire in the Tong bosses office. What? Don't look at me! I didn't write this!  The bad guys don't do anything apart from sit at a long table in a poorly-lit and cold-looking room and smoke cigars while looking evil. The boss isn't even Chinese but an Ian Hislop-lookalike with bushy eyebrows. Every 10 minutes the film will jump to them (subtitles list their hobbies and interests for some strange reason!) and the boss goes 'We have to stop him, he knows too much'.   The fight scenes are horrible. What is the deal with the kung-fu monkey barber? Seriously! What is the deal with that? The computer-generated effects are the worst ever (second to Son of the Mask, nothing will beat that in terms of terribleness). I've seen more convincing stuff on a ZX Spectrum.   Seagal puts NO effort into this film. He looks incredibly bored through-out and looks like he'd rather be praying to Budda. However, you can almost see Frankie Fingers from The Mob loitering off-camera, pointing a gun at his head. I know I wouldn't show enthusiasm if that were the case.   Out for a Kill is directed by Mike Oblonglowiscz, the same amatuer responsible for the equally as horrible The Foreigner. The man has NO idea how to make films and should never be allowed near a camera again. He desperately tries to mime Michael Bay (a dubious choice of inspiration) with his pointless stutter-cuts and incoherent editing which only makes the film look worse, turning it into an avalanche on top of another avalanche. It's quite possible one of the ugliest-looking film you'll ever see. Considering some of the high-profile and veteran production members it's phenomenal they made a film so indescribably bad.  Eternal, everlasting shame on all those involved with making this trash. Utter crap of the lowest order.  The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, showing off the ugly photography and poorly planned camera angles in all their rubbishy glory. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack also turns the films unbelievebly bad sound design into pure torture for the ears. The cover also features 2 exploding helicopters. There are no helicopters in the entire film, never mind exploding ones 
 The best way to destroy sales is for the "author" to blast portions of the book.  In the follow-up to the commercially successful Catch This!, Terrell Owens has said there are erroneous passages in T.O. Because of that comment, it brings into question the validity of the entire book.  Love him or hate him, Owens is a pop culture phenomenon and that may be why Simon & Schuster rushed to print a second autobiography. I can only guess that Owens was not happy with the project and decided to tank sales by ripping the finished product.  Within the proper context I am sure Owens has a ton of interesting things to say. The line of children's books slated for release may be the venue for Owens to make a positive and lasting impression with fans.  
 It didn't work properly from the time it came out of the box.  The carousel wouldn't make a complete rotation, so CDs and DVDs would  get 'trapped' inside the unit.  And occasionally, it would simply refuse to play a DVD altogether.  Panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop, so maybe they can get it to function as it should.  If you do purchase one, please read the warranty carefully;  a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one.  Panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones, under any circumstances.  
 This book is a tiresome rant of the authors personal opinions. His section on alternative medicine is especially uninformed. He claims that food additives are perectly safe and suggests that anyone who questions the FDA must be crazy 
 I bought this to add to my growing collection of etiquette books, but it's less a book of etiquette advice (no real guidelines) and more a book of brief, isolated observations about what kind of person aspiring ladies would like to be ("A lady always knows when to X," "A lady will know how to Y").   Forgive me for pointing out that someone purchasing this book probably already has a fair idea of these kinds of things. That's why they are trying to learn how to become a lady.  The text is sparse, very large and highly stylized with wide margins. It's cute for a coffee table, a gift basket, or other decorating purposes, but if you're looking for an etiquette guide to know HOW to become more lady-like, this book is not for you.  For a catch all reference work, invest in a relatively up to date version of Emily Post's, Amy Vanderbilt's, or Laeticia Baldridge's etiquette books, the first being my favorite. If you'd like something more anecdote/situation driven, try the Miss Manners books by Judith Martin 
 The good news is that I paid only 50 cents for this book in hardback at a thrift store.  The bad news is that I would have been really upset and disappointed if I had paid $12 for a paperback!  I finished it only because I started it, and it was fairly short. Unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing notable about this book. 
 There are three significant problems with this book. "Made in Detroit," is poorly written. Clemens thinks, "went over like a led balloon," is a fine simile. It is not. But Clemens begs his readers to compare him to Baldwin, Hemmingway, and others, a desperate attempt for sophistication he is unlikely to ever gain. (2) Clemens' book is racist and anti-working class to the core. Clemens clearly adopted his fathers' hatred of unions, and formed his own uncritical take on racism, expecting readers to chuckle at his portrayal of African Americans as "moolies." (3) Clemens knows nearly nothing important about Detroit. He views the city through an inverted telescope, each lens juncture narrowing his already myopic view; racism, sexism, the meanest forms of conservative Catholicism, his unexamined views of exploitation and resistance, all merge to give him a key-hole view of, not the city, but himself, his trifling family relationships, and his trembling edicts about his wife-who, I know from experience, is all aflutter about his critics. There are good books about Detroit, like "Whose Detroit?" or "American Odyssey" by Conot (openly fictional, unlike Clemens' piece), or Ewens, "Corporate Power and Urban Crisis," or Mirel's "Rise and Fall of an Urban School System." Clemens work is, flatly, too small-minded to be taken seriously. Only the fact that racism sells could lead local reviewers, and the publisher, to push this book. For those who seek my longer review of Clemens book, google "Michigan Citizen , Made In Detroit." I am the San Diego State prof critiqued in a review below. 
 This is a story book!  I usually give books the benefit of the doubt but this book flat out sux.  All this guy talks about is how he is some hot shot sports agent and the lessons he supposedly learned through the years.  Let me tell you something, this book got old after the 2nd chapter.  Every F'in paragraph has to do with one of his golf clients and bla bla bla.  Its ridiculous.  The title is true, they dont teach this at Harvard because they're stories of an individuals life which completely put me to sleep.  But im not going to leave without giving some positives, like saying you should check out Automatic millionaire and the 12 critical factors books.  Those are worth reading.  Peace in the middle east 
 I read the authors book: THE UNAUTHORIZED VERSION and found it to be well written and enlightening.  When I read the book: PAGANS AND CHRISTIANS I found it to be incomprehensible and dull.  After reading 170 pages I gave up in frustration.  A year later I tried to read it again and got to page 180, before I gave up.  Then I decided to go to the second section on Christianity to see if it improved, but it was as meandering and frustrating as the first part 
 No, my friend: The LIBERATION of Iraq. Stop dithering around: Iran is the problem.  Author does not talk about this 
 This book, the author and his company is a joke. Don't waste your money 
 My son received several new books including this one. He actually got up and walked away while I was reading this one. And he loves to read a varity of books. We enjoyed the Old lady who swallowed a fly. This starts out with a pie and continues until the old Lady eats the entire thanks giving meal. She grows bigger and bigger and lumpier and lumpier until she becomes a thanksgiving balloon in a parade. I also didn't care for the illustrations. Our Thanksgiving meal is special and this illustrated a an old lady getting uglier and uglier. Well, it just didn't do any thing for me. I did read other people's reviews and I see that other families did enjoy this book. I could live without reading it again. And my 3 yr old son doesn't have any interest in it and he can sit for an hour reading many different books with me. 
 After reading the reviews of the book, I expected much more.  The e-book really just whets your appetite with generalities (e.g., about the internet or globalization) summarized from the full-text version.  One could get far more from a typical on-line article in Fortune, Business Week, etc.  The e-book version is 9 pages of about 14 font text, double-spaced.  I guess that this would calculate into about two or three pages of a regular book.  I would still like to read the full-text version but I would advise avoiding the e-book version 
 Usually my favorite book is the one I'm reading at the time.  However, Gardenias for Breakfast is my All Time Favorite Book EVER!!  I have given several copies for gifts and have shared my copy numerous times.  I think if you were a Mother of girls, you would especially relate to this book.  I do not have daughters, but, I am a daughter and I enjoyed it to the fullest.  Robin Jones Gunn is just a fantastic painter of word pictures and she shines in this book 
 I think the movie has potential but ends up taking a childish turn in the end. I agree mostly with the points Mike Leonard makes in his review right here, only my final conclusion is quite more negative. The dvd image looks good for a movie shot in video like this, but it's not anamorphically enhanced, despite what the cover says, so be warned if that's important to you 
 I admit it, I thought the song 'Blurry' was an OK song for a post-grunge/wanabe-grunge band, and most of the other singles off 'Come Clean' were somewhat tolerable. However; when the local rockstations took it upon themselves to bombard us with 'She f--king Hates Meeee' 24/7, I realized just how mediocre they really were. Granted, I knew they weren't so great to begin with, but at least 'Blurry' was a somewhat tolerable Nevermind-derived song. But 'tolerable' isn't really saying much for their artistic ability of which they are obviously lacking.     When their next [and last? :)] album came out and the stations began to play 'Away From Me' it was clear just they were trying way too hard. All you need to hear is the first song, 'Away From Me' to realize that that's just where you should get from this band.    As far as sounding like Nirvana goes, Puddle of Mudd does not sound like them at all, what they sound like is a band blatently trying to rip-off Nirvana's style. That's what the fans hate, and that's why Puddle of Mudd will always be loathed by fans of grunge. They just try too hard. Especially if you look at their videos, of which I only remember seeing one and it was a long time ago, but so much of it, from the underwatery effect to the guy's hair just looked like a Nevermind-era rip off. If I hadn't known who they were beforehand I'd have thought it was a parody! [and a rather bad one at that, nowhere near as great as Weird Al].   Oh and one more thing before I end this, to that guy before me: for future reference, before you go and diss a band you obviously know nothing about, could you at least try and get some facts right? It was not '10-15' years ago, it was 12. And besides that, what exactly does that even have to do with anything? John Lennon died 26 years ago, should we care any less about him and his music as time goes by? Absolutely not. Death means nothing in the world of music, only that it lives on in the hearts and minds of fans everywhere. And lastly, yes you should hate Pepsi for tasting similar to Coke because it's obviously trying too hard to be Coke. :D  I will be very stunned if this band ever has a comeback and even more so if it's successful. I guess the record execs realized that emo was the new hip thing and ditched these guys faster than you can say My Chemical Romance. 
 The cushion was designed for what I needed due to an injury, but the curve of the cushion, the pressure points, and the density of the cushion are wrong.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I have found a similar cushion that works very well 
 I ordered this cereal dispenser for my adult son.  He filled it with raisin bran.  When he turned the knob to release the cereal into a bowl, the flakes of cereal broke up.  Some missed the bowl and went on the floor.  He's going to try putting Cheerios in it to replace the raisin bran.  If it doesn't work well with the Cheerios, I plan to return the item 
 I have to say that I am a fan of Bill Murray's acting (over and beyond his comedic work), and I think that Rushmore and Lost in Translation were efforts that should secure him in the canon of great actors, but this film felt very misguided and took an awful turn at some point.  Murray's soulful, silent stare was way too overused here, cheapening the times he used it quite well in other movies, and after he parts from his neighbor, who is a wonderful character and helped balance out Murray's doleful depression, the film just seems to bottom out and never seems to rise again.  Jarmusch has had much success in the past in following very quiet, interior characters (_Dead Man_, _Ghost Dog_), but here he either overplayed his hand or forgot that what really made those other films work was counterbalance.  Nobody and the French ice cream man are excellent counterweights in the other films to keep things from getting too dragged down, but in this movie, the counterweight is cut away from way too early, and this film suffers for that mistake. 
 Honestly, i think this album's not half as good as MOT.  as a matter of fact, it's worse than their 1990 release, 'step in the arena'.  it's just an okay album 
 This is,i belive,the worst "jazz" album i have heard in a while.Save your money 
 This thing actually performed worse than the antenna that came with the wireless card. That means the range stated on the box is incorrect. Back to the store for a refund. You get what you pay for for. 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 I bought the Tourmaline hoping to save time, because I have very thick, wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten.  It ended up taking just as long, but the results were much better.  My hair was super straight and shiny, and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather.  Then when I was using it for just the 4th time, it completely stopped working.  Just as other people described, the red light shut off and it cooled down, and never turned back on.  I'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now.  
 I will present two points in this book which amazed me unpleasantly. Let's start with the following advice for resume writing: "You'll need 50-100 copies. Sounds like a lot? Don't cheat yourself. You will have to send your resume with each of your initial applications and any follow up correspondence."  This sounds like buying as many lottery tickets as possible only and only to increase your chances to win the big prize. She stresses on huge quantity "50-100 copies", which from my background as Desktop Publisher I can label as mass mailing. In the brick and mortar world its success ratio is around 1% in case that the marketing/sales pitch is really good.   Furthermore you can read: "Carefully proofread your resume as if your job depends on its accuracy. A misspelling or typo brands you as careless..." Well, while I was reading the book, I found 3 typos, 4 grammar mistakes and 3 serious defects in the typesetting of the book. I really want her to DO what she preaches. Unfortunately she neither cares so much how qualitative is her book nor will be your resume. Cynthia Ossenfort, the author of Cruise Ship Jobs! is the other example of going overboard with:" Have a professional photo made and make about 30-50 quality copies."   In the category's bestseller Cruise Ship Job in 14 Days the author advices to make one, maximum two resumes, which are targeted to a specific cruise line, position and hiring manager. Also he has written that The Professional Association of Resume Writers does NOT recommend sending any photos. That's why I prefer to skip the Numbers Game of Mary Miller and Cynthia Ossenfort and follow "The LASER Strategy for Next Generation Applying" in Cruise Ship Job in 14 Days. It will be cheaper and there is greater possibility to get a cruise ship job 
 To me, this book was far too long for the plot. I became so bored just waiting for something to happen that I quit the book right in the middle; skimmed to the end to see who the killer was. The plot would have been a good one had she not drug it out so long 
 I have read a lot better books. A better title for this book would be 'Eminster or Elmara?'. This book reminds me of the famous Ed Wood movie 'Glen or Glenda'. I mean how could you possibly come up with a more stupid idea: The goddess Mystra has to transform him into a women for two purposes. One women can feel magic better than men, at least in this book. Two by transforming Elminster into a women she is hiding him from all those evil magelords who want to kill him. What is interesting about this is even as a women all the magelords still wants to kill her/him because she/he goes around blowing them all up ! Of course thats going to attract unwanted attention. Can you imagine what you enemies an ally's must be thinking. Mystera (Mystra) her/his tutor is suddenly startled in the novel when he turns from being a women into a man. So what does Mystera do? She fall in love with him/her! Now thats logical isn't it ! I don't think the author relizes readers may not have a very pleasent experience undergoing a sex change in the novel. You have any idea what this can do to a person?   The first part of the novel before Elminister becomes a mage he is a theif. While I did find this very interesting and enjoyable to read I kept asking myself what does this have to do with the title of this book, 'the making of a mage'. The book has a real slow begining he doesn't actually start training to become a mage till your a third of the way through the book already like over 100+ pages !  What is interesting too is Mystra this all powerful goddess of magic selects to endow him with all this powerful magic , because he is the most moral , holy men she has met in a long time and trusts he will not misuse his magic. Really? Him? A career theif? Are you kidding me? This theif is going to be this lands savor ridding the world of all evil ? And all through 100+ pages Elminster swears he hates all magic and magic user and would rather die then become one. What happens when he meets this all powerful Mystra, goddess of magic, that asks him to become a mage? He says oh sure why not I will become a mage. This book although around 300 pages feels more like it is an 800 page book. I mean there are too many things happen in this book for it be 300 pages.   There is a lot of unnecessary encounters in this book that really didn't seem to flow with the rest of the story. For example he stays at an Inn somewhere in the book and has no money to pay for his stay at the inn. He tells the Innkeeper I will pay you by making any room of the house larger, better, by magical means. So what room does this Innkeeper want to make bigger? His master bedroom? No! His Foyer? NO! His dinning area? NO! His bar area? NO! His kichen? NO! He says he wants a bigger cespit! Which is where all your garbage and sewage goes! I will keep that in mind the next time I want to remodel my house.   With all this critism there is a reason I am giving this book 2 stars and not 0 stars. There were things I liked about the book. This author is a very descriptive writer and uses a plethera of many descriptive words. While you might need a dictionary on hand it was a lot more descriptive and detailed then I am used to which I did like. I did like a few of the encounters in this book. I enjoyed reading about the Mad Mage and his diabolical plot to destroy Elmara. I enjoyed reading the very detailed magical battle between the mad mage and Elminister.  I enjoyed reading about the Floating tower where Elmara went to retreive Orandals book of magic. At first I didn't like his writing style, but after a while I really enjoyed it. His writing style I found very unique and different then what I am use to. I enjoyed reading how there were many gods and the characters would pray to a certain god to aid them. They would pray to a god to aid them in battle, pray to another god to aid them in magic, pray to another god for healing. There was a god of the wind. A god for  good fortune. I also liked the way he named the different months and seasons in the book.  
 I believe Ms.Krentz has forgotten the meaning of the word variety.  This book is boring.  Don't waste your money her Plots are the same in just about all her books.  If you have read one of her books you have read them  all the only things  that seem to change are the names 
 he cited a fan's thank you letter to congratulate himself and support his thesis(p.107), the fan thank him for dumping silver at 7.8 when it quickly fell to 7, (and could go lower according to the prediction of his system), silver since then kept on rising and is at 13 now, he never satisfactorily explained why gold and silver kept rising despite heavy net short by the commercials, this book is useless except let you learn some terminologies for bluffin 
 Though this book pretends to show all sides fairly, it's extremely biased against evolution (and poorly researched on that side too).  A quick look at the positive reviews here will show you that they are from people who are on the ID/Creation side.  It's a waste of time and paper, unless you just want to make yourself feel good about believing in ID/Creation 
 This is a beautiful but creepy book: a lost sheep all alone, terrified by UFOs no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child. The strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel, but they are also ominous and deterring. His utter solitude, in exploring the house (creepy corridor with blood-colored doors), eating, and finally sleeping, is horrifying to a child with imagination, whose most overriding terror is abandonment. I give it points for beauty and originality, none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience, and cannot recommend it 
 I can't think about any other explanation for this silly, stupid thriller if you want to call it that. I can't believe that the writer is doing so badly. I am most certainly disappointed with this book. In the last couple of years, I think he had lost his steam. Plus, why does he have to come up with 15 books or so a year? Why does he not read his own book before he sends it to the publisher? It's time for me to move on to another writer....  I would advice readers to not to read this book 
 i too was greatly disappointed with this book, i feel it fell far short of the standards set by her other writings, of which i have read most. neither did i appreciate the swear words contained in this book. don't buy i 
 "The Cherry Orchard" is an atrocious play.  If we hold this play in high regard, then we dramatist's need to reevaluate our standards.  Chekhov wrote a play that will make you not care an inch about the character's or their situation(s).  For him to think that this is a comedy makes you wonder if he understood the point he himself was trying to make.  The characters are pathetic and they'll make you pity them - not because of their predicaments, but because of whom they are.  I do not recommend 
 Please read David Maces's review. I bought mine about two years ago and just today the plastic part mentioned by Mr. Mace failed. A sturdy, sleek can opener is now going to the trash permaturely because Hamilton Beach does not provide a replacement part 
 This book made me feel dirty as a womyn. I found it insensitive, uninspired, and inaccurate. Anyone who wants true scholarship should look elsewhere for truth. There were, of course, many Goddesses in herstory,  however to deny them their individual importance with a pseudo-intellectual  monotheistic interpretation makes us no better than the men we must  educate. It is time for synchronism, not separatism 
 As one of the reviewers said if you really liked MELODY AM, you might be up for a surprise here. I suggest you listen to this album very carefully before buying it.  From mellow electro of MELODY AM, they went to electro-POP with an aftertaste of the 80's for many songs in THE UNDERSTANDING.  Sometimes, I hear some sounds of Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, and others in the after-taste portion of the songs.  Music is always hard to describe, that's the best I can do.  Their songs 11-12 of THE UNDERSTANDING are probably the ones I prefer, still they're not brilliant, and #11 reminds me of AIR 
 I have been a fan of Star Trek for many years now, and I'd heard about this book.  "The Physics of Star Trek", sounded like a really fun read.  I was interested to know how some of the technology that was invented for the show might be practically applied, or how it could work in the real world.  But the Author goes about destructing the technology and "physics" of star trek and telling us that "it wont work because...".  That might be a better title for this book "Star Trek technology wont work because..."  OK, so we all know that star trek is fiction - It is not real.  If you think its real your in a bit of trouble.  But it is nice to once and a while escape into a world of make believe and fantasy.  This book goes about systematically disproving and destructing the technology and "physics" of star trek, umm ... we know its not real ok?  For example, there is a section on Warp Drive.  The author spends (too much) time setting the scene of a ship in orbit and the captain tells the ensign to set a course and go to warp.  He then goes about explaining that if the ship went to warp everybody would be turned to moosh against the back wall.  Then goes about explaining why warp drive is not possible because you cant handle the G-forces.  Wow!  What an insight.  Star Trek will probably tell you that there is other technology helping prevent this ... like inertial dampers perhaps, and the main deflector `deflecting' space dust?  This is all beside the point when you consider that Warp Drive is theoretical at this stage only, and it was made for TV.  It is like a University in USA that performed wind tunnel test to see how the Enterprise would handle space flight.  Then witting a report explaining that the design of the ship is totally wrong and it would break apart.  How stupid can you get, why would you bother going out of your way to disprove a fictional technology.  I would have preferred this book to acknowledge that the technology in star trek is not possible in its current form, but would it not be wonderful if we could transport from one place to another in a blink of an eye, and this is how it might work?  If you are considering this book as part of your star trek collection, better look elsewhere.  Anoth reviewers wrote the following that I think are importaint points also...  Mr. Krauss does a great job of explaining why Star Trek technology is impossible in the real world. What I wanted to know was how it worked in the Star Trek world. -"rickandsue" (Weymouth, MA United States)  ...And all his assumptions on the technology is using modern day physics, which is portrayed by the author as the absolute truth to the universe. 500 years ago it was impossible to circumnavigate the earth, 50 it was the sound barrier, I suprise a scientist would say that anything(such as warp drive) is impossible no matter what improvement in physics. -locutus@oz.net "fedallah4" (Silverdale, Washington) 
 Okay, so this is the diva-in-training that's supposed to bring glamour back to opera?  Yes, she is beautiful.  Shame those hands had to scrub floors; hope she makes it on the cover of Vogue someday.  However, she is not the Great New Hope for opera.  That voice is not suited for bel canto, or Mozart.  She sounds like a new Barbara Frittoli to me.  Frittoli, with a dash of Fleming. She has that taffy-pull to her voice, like Fleming, without the heavy portamento and sighing and all those other awful Fleming tricks.  The basic color of the voice is interesting, rather dark-hued, but the technique is not quite there, despite the studio producers' best attempts to turbo-charge her high notes.  Sorry, guys, but for romantic French and Italian bel canto reperatoire, I am sticking with Natalie Dessay 
 I bought this book because I had read a good review of the follow-up "Murder of Angels" and thought this would be a better starting point.  I am a voracious reader, and I can honestly say I rarely use the word "hate" when describing a book.  I won't use it this time either, but I will say that I can never get back the time I spent (wasted?) reading this book.  To be fair, maybe it just wasn't for me.  If you are really into super-confusing, creepy books with self-pitying, annoying, wear-it-on-their sleeve outcast characters-- this might be just the tale for you 
 This is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the 1860's narrated by a Civil War deserter.  Within the first few pages, our hero enlists, pilfers letters off battlefield corpses, deserts, is injured in NYC draft riots, ends up in New Bedford, MA and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going.  The book was downhill from there.  Page after page described ice and the crew's interminable struggles to get through.  Getting through the book was nearly as interminable.  The reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him, or really understand him at all.  Thus, his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles.  There are elements of fantasy in the book.  Not enough to make it a fantasy, but enough to steer a reader off course.  The scientist on the mission is after a warm Garden of Eden in the middle of the Arctic.  He is mad or it's fantasy, it is hard to know until the end.  There is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands (the most likeable character in the book) describes how he got his third hand.  From that yarn comes the title "Rope Eater".  The title really has nothing to do with the book, other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain.  Besides the tedious turning of the plot, the characters lack any development.  Only the three handed man and the captain, both tangential characters, had any depth whatsoever.  This book seemed to be an attempt at adventure, but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension.  It never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters - mentally and physically - it just happened.  Although the reader knew the characters must be suffering, it never came through the over-writing.  As one might expect, the crew's mission to find the warm Garden of Eden in the arctic was pointless.  So was this book.  It was a disappointment.  
 They tell you tha this product holds 6AA batteries, and works with the 20D's battery grip, but when I received the item it is for a completely different product and DOES NOT WORK with the 20D's BG-E2 grip.  It has the product name of CPM-E3, just as stated...but it accepts 8 AAA batteries and doesn't even come close to working with the BG-E2.  
 Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.   I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!  It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.   Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty 
 Thank God I DID NOT BUY this book. I took 30 minutes to read this book at a bookstore and if you are interested in learning how to hack, then this book is not for you. This book DOES NOT SHOW YOU HOW TO HACK, it's just  another ordinary book which shows you how to PREVENT a hacker from attacking your computer/network. Very disappointing. Even the information in this book that shows you how to prevent a hacker attack can be found online easily. This book is definatly not worth it 
 "The Glorious Cause" is the sequel to "Rise to Rebellion," and since the first novel was so good I eagerly dove into this one, but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 4, as compared to the 8 I would give "Rise to Rebellion."  The events recounted in "Rise to Rebellion" involving the lead up to the Revolutionary War seemed so much more detailed and interesting, with a vast array of characters that were so colorful; John Adams, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and others. "The Glorious Cause" was not without its merits, but it seemed so much drier and less appealing, with a more narrow focus. It was far too long in some parts, to the point my attention wandered, and getting through it was a chore in some sections, unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages. I listened to this book on audio tape during my commute, and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene.  One element I felt truly slighted by was the coverage of Benedict Arnold and his defection to the British cause. I assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book, but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material.  A mark of a good book is how I feel when I have finished reading it - if I am disappointed I have reached the end of the story, then I know it was time well spent. Getting to the end of "The Glorious Cause" felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project; it was uncomfortable work, and now that I'm done I feel I can do something a bit more interesting. Because Shaara did such a good job with "Rise to Rebellion" I don't feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility; perhaps the subject matter didn't complement my taste as well. I prefer interesting historial detail over tepid, droning battle descriptions, and I feel the differences between those two categories represent perfectly the differences between "Rise to Rebellion" and "The Glorious Cause. 
 Being a big Russell Banks fan, I was very much looking forward to reading The Darling, a book that addresses a subject matter that is clearly a departure for Banks.  I wish he'd stuck with trailer parks and the rural working class. The only reason I finished the book was because I was so hoping something bad would happen to the heroine.  She is perhaps the least likable, least sympathetic heroine in a book I've ever read. What ever happened to writers writing what they know?  Banks using a woman as a first person narrator was a big mistake. Hannah rings so hollow to me, a supremely self-absorbed, irritating and, in many ways, dangerous person to anyone she encounters. The dialogue throughout -- particularly the trite conversations among the characters about the "sixties" -- was contrived and unreal.  I was immensely disappointed 
 The corset looks so pretty... its a pretty material... It can hold you YES... it has a boning made of some crappy material... after wearing it I noticed something was poking Me... both ends the top and the bottom... well when I take a look it looks like the type of thing guys use to fish line.  It hurted so bad... so I tried to "snip" it with some nail clippers.. they just keep on coming and coming... it totally sucks.. now I cant even use it without thinking of a painful experience 
 This book was conceived from an incorrect perception of "America". United States is not only America. What about the other countries such Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Argentina, etc. Maybe, the correct title for this book is "Some surnames in United States of America". Since the United States of America were forged with immigrants, the author did not respect the particularities of other surnames established in the United States as jews, russians, germans, frenchs, irish, among others 
 Francis Ford Coppola should not be listed as an author of this book.  I bought it because I thought Copppla was one of the authors.  He is quoted in the book but he did not write it.  I think this is misleading to  readers 
 Early on in the introduction pages the author blows off Gelato, "I'll leave it to the Italians".  She mostly ignores custdard based ice creams to concentrate on "American Ice Cream", spell that Philadelphia style ice cream.  Well, okay. to each their own.  Then she includes recipies for cookies, cakes, etc., which have nothing to do with my ice cream maker.  I think ice cream lovers are better off buying the Williams-Sonoma book.  If you want a reprise on the old Cooks Ilustrated ice cream book look into the latest Cooks Illustrated Best Recipies book.  It has a great synopsis of their original book, it is far less expensive than the $99 used book sellers are asking for the original on Amazon and offers some great food recipies as well.

 But I am a big fan of the music.  While I get the fact that Sally Bowles is supposed to be second-rate and I'm all for doing Cabaret as realistically as possible, I still find it extremely difficult to listen to Natasha's Richardson's singing.  I just can't figure out why one would voluntarily subject oneself to something so terrible and painful to listen to.  The patrons of the "real" Kit Kat Club were obviously really drunk and depressed while listening to Sally Bowles, but I'm not prepared to get wasted every time I want to listen to the music of Cabaret.  I don't doubt that Natasha Richardson was great in the role, but maybe it was necessary to see her in the the show to derive pleasure from her songs here.    Everyone else is fine.  
 Over the years I read numerous books by Danielle Steel and this definitly tops the list as the worst book yet.  Plot is incredibly weak.. 
 The padding is too bulky toward the knuckels. There is no padding on the fingers. The gloves are closed palm so your hands get sweatier faster. Overall these gloves are a poor excuse for grappling gloves 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 Peter Lance is just another sensationalist who spouts misinformation at every opportunity ...hoping to lead you the reader, or perhaps an American seeking truth, down the path of distraction and outright fantasy.  Maybe he took lessons from his previous employer, a CIA controlled TV network ...or maybe Karl Rove of the Bush administration.  Either way, if you really want to know the truth about 911, read some David Ray Griffin, or get one of Eric Huschmid's DVD/videos.  As for Peter Lance, well ...if you have time for fiction and more government spin, then by all means, please help yourself to an extra big serving of the same 
 Only 38 pages into this book, I've had to put it down in sheer awe of how utterly inaccurate this book is.   From the questions it suggests you ask a prospective pediatrician to the AAP's "neutral" view on circumcision, this book is obviously written in a very biased undertone.   Thankfully, I got this from the library. All I have to do is return it and try and forget the bad, bad information it provided.   Keep looking 
      The book Many Lives, Many Masters tells a fascinating story.  I am thankful to the book especially for all these reviews, that are about far more than the book itself. They show a beautiful wide rainbow of states of mind.  Our Mind.  The single heart and soul warming story in this book creates many new questions for all of us, who are on our way to the spiritual awakening, trying to access the higher levels of our consciousness.  There are many people, who already KNOW, what the others only BELIEVE, or want to know or believe.   On our way there and in your quest for more, I recommend reading the book "I am me I am free" by DAVID ICKE, who shares his great experiences and knowledge in his very special own unique fantastic and loving way.      Congratulations to all of us.  We deserve to be admired and praised.    FIVE STARS to EVERY ONE OF US and still, let's shoot for more!!!   And, not to worry.  All we don't learn here, we will find out exactly how it is, when the right time comes.  It will be even much nicer, than we now think.  Wanna bet 
 It's hard to bellive there are people so gullible as to believe this convicted felon.  IMHO he's a crook and a con ma 
 It is quite possible for this film to wash over you and leave absolutely no trace of passing.  There are about three or four lines in this effort which are funny however the tedium in-between does not make them worth the wait.  Part of the problem with this film was that I felt that I had seen it all before. Which, of course, I had in Four Weddings. Slightly pathetic, floppy-haired middle-class Englishman falls for glamorous American who rejects him them gets back together with him and has a group of friends suffering from various disabilities.  Not since "Intersection" have I spent a movie looking at my watch to see when it ended. I honestly don't know who was worse, Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant. They both became so grating on the nerves that I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The most enjoyable part of the film (aside from it being over) were the trailers they showed before it.  Not worth seeing or renting. Save the money for something better... it shouldn't be that hard 
 This book is a crock.  It is full of fallacies that the author presents as "truth" to those who don't know any better.  Granted, the "master cleanser diet" might very well work (I've decided against it) and the author is fairly up-front of the negative effects one will likely experience.  But the explanations and claims this book makes are ridiculous.  The author claims that there are no such thing as disease-causing bacteria and viruses.  Also, he claims that the lack of protein in this diet is not a problem because your body will assimilate nitrogen and carbon from the air you breathe into the components of protein.  Take an introductory biology class, Stanley Burroughs, before you make such laughable claims.  
 You'd think the director of the original Japanese series could turn out a decent sequel. But nooooooo....   Instead, "The Grudge 2" is a detailed, shimmering example of why people loathe sequels, and how (with rare exceptions like preplanned trilogies) they are pretty much always bad. Overused spooks, lackluster acting and a plotless plotline are only a few of the things wrong with this croaking horror.   Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) learns that her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is seriously ill, and goes to Japan to fetch her -- with horrifying results. Karen's last warning: "Don't go in that house."   Other people aren't doing the same, since a trio of schoolgirls went into the house and are now being haunted by everyone's least favorite croaking ghosts, Kayako and Toshio. And an American family in Chicago is being slowly destroyed by visions of the ghosts, which have somehow transferred out of Japan and into the United States.   Aubrey and a reporter investigate the odd circumstances of Karen's madness and demise, going to the abandoned house that Karen tried to burn down. As the malevolent ghosts close in on them, Aubrey discovers the secret past that has turned Kayako into an evil force that cannot be stopped...   Ghosts, ghosts, everywhere, and not one of them is actually scary. Apparently Takashi Shimizu assumed that the more apparitions you put in a movie, the scarier it becomes. Sadly, it doesn't work that way -- Kayako and Toshio pop up for a cheap care every few minutes, and when they aren't around, OTHER ghosts are popping up for no good reason.   All those ghosts are mainly there to prop up a thin-as-paper storyline, with flaccid dialogue and a few cursory nods to the previous film. The schoolgirl storyline is completely disposable, and the Chicago one is a transparent set up for the inevitable (and dreaded) "Grudge 3," during which the horror rules get recklessly broken. So only a third of the movie has any interesting content -- usually a few minutes of exposition about Kayako.   It's rather sad that Gellar is the ruling force here, and she's only in it for a few minutes total. She's certainly more charismatic than the Tamblyn, who seems to be sleepwalking through her role. Ohga Tanaka and Takako Fuji provide some scares as the ghosts, even misused, but the rest of the cast is simply going through the motions of really tepid acting.   "Grudge" had its flaws, but it was a horror masterpiece compared to its disastrously pointless sequel -- it's all about piling as many ghostly appearances as possible into three thin plots. Cinematically, this is a curse 
 Names and Dates,thats about it,I must say I expected alot more from Patrick mccarthy this book was dissapointing to say the least nice cover though.Only hardcore historians might find this book a little use but for the rest look elsewhere 
 In the introduction the author states that feminism is the most important discourse of the 20th century.  He recites feminist dogma about men as if it were unquestioned fact, "sustaining unequal material advantage, opportunity, status, and privilege," p-3.  I'm sorry, but I don't believe that feminism and feminist women have any more valid things to contribute to an understanding of men and masculinity than the National Socialists contributed to our understanding of Jews.    The rest of the book continues to be a compilation of feminist men bashing couched in scholarly language.  For example, in essay 8, Naming Men as Men, the author starts out by claiming that many writers use "men" in the titles of their books but actually don't interview men in the text.  The author of this statement then cites feminist women to support his theory.  Much of this essay, like the others, is devoted to women and how men are now supposed to adjust to whatever women want.  In conclusion the authors says that "this chapter has sought ... to identify the gendered nature of power and power relations in contemporary organizations. In other words, it has repeated feminist dogma about men and power.    One flaw that is pervasive is reliance on feminist writers as authorities on men, p-147 for example.  The book is supposed to be about men and masculinitites.  Why do they think that females have any clue about men and masculinity?  Do the authors review men and masculist literature?  Not so you would notice.  In addition, the feminist concept of "the patriarchy" is continually given credence as an accepted standard rather than recognizing it as misandrist propaganda.  A more reasonable approach to understanding men would be to forget the prevalent feminist theories and to start looking at men.    Use of the concept of "the patriarchy" throughout this book is a dead giveaway at it's intent and focus.  As Sam Keen says in "Fire in the Belly, on Being a Man," P-196, "Perhaps the best rule of thumb to use in detecting ideological feminism is to pay close attention to the ideas, moral sentiments, arguments, and mythic history that cluster around the notion of "patriarchy."  "Patriarchy" is the devil term, the code word for the evil empire of men, the masculine conspiracy that has dominated human history since the time of the fall."  In The Masculine Reader, "the patriarchy" is probably the most commonly used word and concept. Anyone wanting to learn about men and masculinity would be far better off reading Sam Keen.   A serious discourse on men and masculinity is badly needed.  Unfortunately this book is very wide of the mark.  You can't learn about men by reading and believing the misandrist theories of anti-men feminism.  A better book real understanding of men is a serious need.   
 This book is mostly built around the idea "I wish it were true = it *is* true".  While this book has innate appeal to those looking for meaning in their lives, if you're looking for a firm foundation for understanding coincidences in your life (i.e. intellectual integrity), you'd be better off buying an introduction to probability 
 This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste. 
 I bought this for a teen with some challenges. He's very smart, but has some social problems and he requested this book because of his new interest in girls. Unfortunately, in trying to "get to their level" this book often introduces new rudenesses and also teaches kids to make light of manners issues.  I wouldn't recommend it for most kids under 16, and those over 16 would find it too simplistic. 
 I was dissapointed in the quality of this microphone. The sound effects are very loud and "crumbly" and the microphone itself is a bit cheap.  The microphone does not amplify the voice very loud either.  Cute to look at though 
 I wish I could write a good review of this coffee machine & Capresso in general but unfortunately my experience with the 455 model & Capresso itself has been horrible. I bought my Capresso 455 (Stainless carafe model) in July 2006. I was very impressed with the grinding options & the overall functionality of the machine & the coffee it produced was great. But by September the electronics had failed & the LCD readout was going haywire. I called Capresso & they immediately sent out a brand new machine to replace the faulty unit.   The new unit worked perfectly until February 2007 when the drip basket stopped working. It would no longer stay in place when I tried to swing it over under the grinder to start the grind/brew process. I again called Capresso & they told me to pack it up & send it back for repairs. I then got a voice message telling me that they had never received the original unit that I had sent back in September 2006 so they wouldn't perform the repairs on this unit until they received it back. I won't waste your time with all the phone calls that took place about this! Suffice it to say that I HAD sent the machine back & I had never heard a word from Capresso in the 7 months since that time & now they were expecting me to somehow track their UPS return label to prove that the machine had been delivered!!  I finally convinced them that there was nothing I could do about it now & they agreed to complete the repairs & return the machine to me but WITHOUT any warranty. The kicker to the story is that when the repaired machine finally arrived, it had brand new internal damage to it (the broken pieces were all over the inside of the water resevoir) & has had to be returned yet again. Naturally I have written to the President of the company about this ridiculous situation & while much of this problem can be written of as a bad customer service experience, the fact is that I have had 2 mechanical failures on this machine within a year as well as additional damage caused by the repair technicians (I'm fairly certain that it was not caused during the shipping - The unit was extremely well packed.  My advice is this: If you can find another machine that does the same things as the Capresso 455 give it a shot. While this coffee maker performs superbly when it actually works, 2 failures on different machines within a year is not a good track record. I also found their customer service department to be extremely unhelpful as soon as they had identified me as a "problem customer". I never had a leg to stand on once they said they hadn't received the machine from the return call tag that they had issued. Why in the world would I have wanted to keep a machine that didn't work in the first place???   BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. 
 This book will be most useful for fundamentalists who wonder about the contradictions in the Bible if it is read literally 
 From the moment I picked up a copy of GUILTY PLEASURES and started reading it, I was hooked on Anita Blake and pretty much devoured the succeeding books. Anita became like a friend and I simply had to know what the author had in store for her, hence I used to pick up the next book as soon as I get to the last page of the previous one. Sadly, this series also proves that all good things must come to an end as we see in the decline of the quality of Hamilton's writing after OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY.   When I write reviews, I do like to summarize the plot. However after reading INCUBUS DREAMS, I was stuck trying to figure out how to begin my review. The problem is that this book has no plot, even though the back cover may suggest otherwise. This is so far the lengthiest book in the series, but there was hardly any of the kick-as* action that I have come to love in the other books, especially the first few. Ask me what I liked about the other books and I can go on about it. Ask me what INCUBUS DREAMS is about and all I can remember is that Anita spent more time feeding the ardeur, which meant getting down and dirty with any man that was available several times a day, whether in private or in front of her numerous male friends. I am certainly no prude but the sex scenes in this book were simply gratuitous and boring. Anita has spent more time on her back and knees than killing those monsters. I miss the old Anita whose sarcasm and no-nonsense attitude I found entertaining and actually endearing. Will someone please tell Ms Hamilton to bring her back?  I will not ramble on much further, but I can tell you now that MICAH is actually worse than this one. I still have DANSE MACABRE to go, but I am leaving that for much much later since I am not sure I can handle any more of Anita's sexual antics at the moment 
 I have previously enjoyed all of Suzanne Brockmann's books but this one is a departure from her usual interesting fiction. I have struggled to finish it but it is so tedious with stupid situations and circumstances, I really hate it. What a yawner and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like to be bored and frustrated 
 We struggled through this - luckily we didn't pay to see it. (My stepdaughter owns it, and lent it to me.) A waste of time 
 I was unhappy the moment I started to read this book.  I don't know if its an awkward translation at fault or if the writer is too academic, but try this sentence on for size: "These latter casual remarks of ours point to another contribution to mind-knowledge of a more theoretical character concerning those aforementioned age-old philosophical attitudes which arise from false factual premises, with vast theoretical superstructures framed to fit those premises."  ...huh?  And these we-will-twist-your-arm-to-become-a-believer statements offend me: "To this sick and truly demented world of ours, there comes an ancient teaching of eternal wisdom and unfailing guidance, the Buddha-Dhamma, the Doctrine of the Enlightened One, with its message and power of healing."  Overall, I found sentences too awkward, and paragraphs too cryptic. I kept skipping pages trying to find a good "starting" place but alas, never found one.   This book might be (emphasis on might be) a great fit for an advanced yogi/yogini, but for someone looking to start his or her understanding of meditation and perhaps the relationship between Dharma and meditation, this is not the book.

 Allison announces in his first sentence of his Preface that this, the 2nd edition of a book originally published in 1983 is "substantially revised," and so it is, especially the last half of it. It was an important work of scholarship 23 years ago, and a revision after so much time during which he has remained a teacher and scholar specializing in Kant, was bound to excite  broad interest.  It must have gone far toward gaining for him the prestigious prize of $30,000 he was awarded last year (2005) for outstanding Kantian scholarship.    In the preface Allison cites Michelle Grier as having awakened him from his dogmatic slumbers.  In the body of the text he mentions her name only once, but given the compliment to her, my curiosity was aroused.  First I looked at the endnotes in which her work was mentioned by Allison, and then, a little puzzled, I looked carefully over her book, Kant's Doctrine of Transcendental Illusion, published in 2001.  I found many citations of her work in the endnotes.  Adding them up, I found that there were 28 endnotes, these referred, by explicit citation, to 200 pages of her 305 page book.  What one finds in comparing the two books, his and hers, is that every idea or argument that Allison advances and almost every reference, citation to Kant or to other philosophers, supposition, hypothesis, or development is to be found explicitly in Grier.  It is impossible to compare the two books and not conclude that Allison had no new ideas of his own at all, at least for the last half of his book, the half that he claims developments in Kantian scholarship had compelled him to fully and carefully rethink and therefore to have most fully revised.  If one were to remove from Allison's book, however, the ideas, arguments, and so forth that he derived directly and unambiguously from Grier, there would be nothing but minor and for the most part exceedingly trivial asides. It would, to put it simply, not have been publishable.  It is apparent that rather than generously recognizing Michelle Grier by his compliments and endnotes, he was stabbing her in the back.  His "generous" remarks have the effect of diminishing her role in his accomplishment.  He makes it seem as though she inspired him or set him on the right track rather than to have fashioned the final intellectual product that he merely, but arrogantly, rephrased.  Nowhere does he acknowledge the incontestable truth, as of course he cannot, that he was himself entirely empty, and given a choice between remaining silent or stealing from the younger, creative scholar, Michelle Grier, the work he wished he had produced himself, he chose the shabbier but more profitable course.   
 In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to "do Europe". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack.  In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip.  "Neither Here Nor There" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him.  Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had.  Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees "the sights" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications.  This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.   But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe:  1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result.  2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by.  3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar.  4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices.  This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean:  "Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team." (pg 32)  "The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there." (pg 91)  "In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide." (pg 97)  "But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime." (pg 110)  "I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people." (pg 123)  In conclusion, if you're someone who "did Europe" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book.

 Some thoughts on "A Carnivore's Inquiry:"  A narrator can be both sympathetic and unsympathetic provided that they are interesting to read about. Katherine's closest relative, Hannibal Lecter, knew more about wine, food and culture than we did, and we envied him for it.  Katherine Shea knows very little about anything other than what brands surround her, and her ambivalence towards horrific events is merely adolescent rather than indicative of humanity.  Murray's exquisite skill at painting a scene is akin to eating nothing but Creme Brulee. Inside the twelve course meal that is the novel, one craves a greater variety of ingredients. I am sure her short stories are marvels.  Her characters are not convincing actors; their motivations for action are suspect when they are present, which is not often. We are asked to believe that our distant, dilettante narrator inspires lust and love in every man she meets.  This is implied and not convincingly rendered.  The historical recreations fail to reflect, augment or amplify the novel's main theme: man's hunger for literal or spiritual wealth (laid down in a paragraph on page 286).  Thought was given to their rendering, but not to their overall thematic importance.  We cannot believe in her resourcefulness as a character because chance plays too large a role in her life.  For a gourmand, she is surprisingly chaste about describing sex or her carnivorous meals.  Murray's talents would have been put to great use here. 
 its really funny that christians are saying that the quraan is contradictry ( the wine story) because we all know that there are so many different bibles with so many contradictory views. let me enligthen you, ther quraan was revealed over 1400 yrs ago and yet not one word, not a single letter, or even a punctuation mark has been changed. and litteraly billions of muslims learn the quraan by heart ( the entire 30 chapters) every day, young and old, men and women, your so called fundamentalists and mordernists.   now about the wine verses. you need to know that before the quraan was revealed arabia was steeped in "ignorance". it was a norm to bury baby girls alive!!! the quraan was revealed over a  period of 23yrs and bit by bit things were forbidden. the first wine related verse told muslims " Oh ye who believe donot go near prayer while ye are intoxicated until you know well what you say"  the second verse says "hey ask thee concerning wine (al-khamri) and gambling. Say: "In them is great sin, AND SOME PROFIT, for men; but the sin is greater than the profit.""  ye who believe! Intoxicants (al-khamru) and gambling, (dedication of) stones, and (divination by) arrows, are AN ABOMINATION,- OF SATAN'S HANDWORK: eschew such (abomination), that ye may prosper. Satan's plan is (but) to excite enmity and hatred between you, with intoxicants (al-khamri) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah, and from prayer: will ye not then abstain? S. 5:90  so ofcourse you as a non muslim would be confused. contradictory?No!  you see for us muslims the quraan is our guide and the hadeeth-sayings of the Prophet Muhammed is the key to understanding the Quraan. God, in his infinate wisdom were "weening" the muslims of wine.   we r all aware of the harms of alcohol. if u dont drink alcohol u have no chance of becoming an alcoholic! For us muslims, wine which is a luxury will be offered to us in paradise  neways about the terrororism issue. This guy is so misinformed, im starting to wander if he is for real.  Get this, Islam tottaly forbids the killing of women and children, the old, the innocent and even trees @ the time of  war! What is this man going on about i dont know.  Even suicide is islam is forbidden, so suiciding bombing is NOT ALLOWED! especially since it may be harming the innocent. I mean even abortion is not allowed!!  Islam and women abuse? Puhleeeez! I am a muslim woman, my religion is ISLAM!Do i feel abused, misused,opprressed? NO!!!  Look, a mans responsibility in Islam is far greater than a womens. For example my share of inheritance is slightly less than a mans. Does this mean islam is unfair!It only means that a man is supposed to use his inheritance to feed and clothe the women in society who have NOTHING, like a bag lady for example. I can do whatever i want with my money, my brother cant!  A husbands responsibitly is greater than a wifes. Therefore his status is higher, a mothers responsibility is greater than a fathers therefore her status is higher. Islam believes in the equality of sexes not the identicality of the two!!!  As for a man having four wives,he has to treat them exactly the same, imagine that if you have four wives and you decide to buy a dkny handbag 4 1 wife,the other 3 need to get the same. A swimming pool for 1, yip the other 3 need one to! And hes reseon for marrying the other 3 wives should not be driven by lust.    If islam is treated as a whole, if people read both the Quraan, and consulted the hadeeth, than i believe even the problem of poverty would be eliminated. Because in Islam we have to give, give and give.One of our fundemental principles tell us to give 2.4% of our wealth to the poor every year. Imagine if everyone who is able to so,does this! We should wish for others what we wish for ourselves  So for those of you who think Islam is the religion of terrorists you are sadly misinformed!  Books like this, are a product of religious hatred. It inflames hatred of other religions for islam, and for islam to the rest of the world. Its not my religion that is turning muslims into terrorists its the usage of this kind of propoganda against the muslims that fuels a passion that they cannot control. It blinds them from realising that being violent ( By this i include burning up embassies) is wrong, prohibited, and is not the way to move forward.     
 Ms Howard is usually a dependable author but she really let her readers down with this one.  It's OK to expect a reader to suspend disbelief every now & again but one would have to have a frontal lobotomy to buy what she is selling in this one.  So disappointing, especially after her wonderful & hilarious "To Die For."  The trees (for paper) that gave up their lives for this book die for nothing this time.   
 This book basically tells you that 1. God understands 2. Other people have been through worse and still maintained their faith 3. You can too by following their example.  It's basically a collection of testimonies to help you see that you can get through _________.   If your questions are on an intellectual or rational level as are mine, stay away from this book. 
 Very little to work with here.  Covers everything, but with little detail.  For instance, there are only six pages in the book on sub-contractors. Search a little more and you can find a different resource that will be much more detail oriented.   
 If I were editing the book I would have told the author I want it to look like this: 10 pages on the idea of the weather channel and how it got to cable, 5 page pictoral of hot weather channel chicks, 12 pages on big storms the network has covered, 2 pages on how much of a weeny Paul Goodloe is and 230 pages on Jim Cantore. Folks, Jim Cantore IS the weather channel. He is on the edge of your seat entertainment that dares weather to take him on. Whether he is chasing after ann F-5 tornado with a paddle to stop it, surfing the waves of a cat 5 hurricane or reporting from a blizzard in a speedo, Cantore takes the worst mother nature has to offer and laughs at it. Yes, there are some other strong anchors at TWC like Sharon Resultan, Dr. Paul Kocin and Dr. Steve Lyons, but they are cluttered up by goofs like Goodloe and Bob Stokes. Stephanie Abrams is pretty hot. Cantore needs to pull a Sting and just leave the weather channel. If there were a cable channel just called Cantore that featured Jim going to places with the most horrible weather in the world, I would watch 24/7. I do realize Cantore can't do 24 hours worth of shows, but he would have to give his approval for any show on the network. If it gets Cantore approval, it's must see TV. This book missed out on a chance to tell the legend's story, but it does mention him so it's a good read 
 How much can I emphasize that I wish we HAD NEVER PURCHASED THIS SYSTEM?  Purchasing a radio from a dollar store would be a better investment.  This unit is the result of poor manufacturing and will provide you with poor performance.  I'd give it no stars if that were an option.  We have had our new Bose system hooked up for about two months.  One major complaint is the lack of a headphone jack.  I have never heard of a stereo system without a headphone jack.  We were updating all of our components and purchased a new Sony DVD Recorder/VHS and a new DirecTV DVR with Tivo.  We were trying to pair down our equipment.  Turns out, none of these components have a headphone jack.  All of these newer components are being produced without headphone jacks, which left us in quite a pickle.  Fortunately, we found a company called "Ramsey Electronics" which provides a headphone amplifier with audio cables to allow us to hook our headphones through the Ramsey unit and then into the Bose unit.  It set us back $80.  Next, we had the dilemma with the remote.  The Tivo remote won't work with Bose, though it did work with my 12 year old Pioneer sound system.  Then, I spent another $100 on a decent learning remote that could control all of my components, but I'd rather use the Tivo remote.  As irritating as that was, the most irritating thing about the Bose unit is that the audio/video plugs do not stay plugged in.  They are all kind of "loose."  We bought new, expensive A/V cables, thinking that would solve the problem.  We've tried everything to remedy this problem, including pushing the unit up against the back wall of our entertainment center in order to keep the plugs from falling out.  I can't tell you how disheartening it is to be in the middle of a movie with a $1300 Bose sound system and just have the sound go OUT because one of the plugs fell out of its socket.  It's not a tension issue, either.  It's poor manufacturing.  Even more flawed is the DVD disc tray.  First, there is NO eject button on the remote, then when you press the eject button on the unit, it will just say "Opening..." Nothing happens!  Then, when you press it again, it just says "Closing..."  Nothing happens.  My husband had to "teach" me that if you push the eject button in rapid succession, you can sometimes get it to open.  That's just swell for a $1300 investment.  I have a DVD player in the guest room that I paid $29.99 for and it opens and closes its disc tray, no problem.  Go figure.  Fortunately, for us, we have the Sony DVD Recorder/Player and use it when the Bose is being "temperamental."  We've only been able to successfully watch 3 DVDs using the Bose because the tray won't open.  Also, it sounds NOTHING like it does in the store.  I don't know if they have some special demo disc or what, but our 12 year old Pioneer system had far superior sound.  We've never owned a Bose unit before and thought we were stepping up to purchase this one.  I think we stepped way down.  Also, how can a company that manufactures headphones-not make any units with a headphone jack?  That makes no sense, at all.  To inform me in the literature that I will "lose sound quality" by plugging my Bose headphones into a "non-Bose" component must be some sort of joke.  The Bose units don't have a headphone jack, what else am I supposed to plug them into?  I am confused about this.  I've always been told that Bose is the leader in sound components, but this headphone issue is just a lack of good common sense and the shotty manufacturing of the plugs and disc tray have caused me an enormous amount of stress and regret.  Save yourself money, time, regret, and stress by finding a different system.  This one will only test your sanity in regards to the $1300 you spent on this piece of junk 
 The last thing I needed was another atlas. I have several---including all the popular and expensive ones!  I also have the basic and inexpensive.  I have finder chart books and finder chart cards. I have field guides and beautiful presentation atlases. I have lots of software too---planetarium modeling software and charting software. Did I need this new pocket atlas? No! But I must confess that I enjoy maps and charts so this was a necessary addition to my collection.  Keep that in mind: I have a built-in liking for charts so it would take a lot for me not to like a  chart book!  First impression. I like the size, the feel of the paper---though not laminated it should be durable---and the design which allows the book to lay flat. Why aren't all atlases spriral bound?! I like the look of the charts---very familiar as it's pretty much a chopped up copy of my Sky Atlas 2000---  Now it gets dicey. The publishers say in the forward that they didn't want pages too small to be useful. I think they missed. In my opinion, the areas covered are annoyingly small. Had a lunar atlas format been followed---i.e., show me a large area divided into perhaps 8 charts, with the overview giving some detail, great. This is is missing. Or at least lacking. There are overview pages but they are not particularly useful unless you know exactly what you are are looking at.  And I suppose that is the heart of the matter. If you know where M51 is but need to refine your position a bit by checking a reference, this pocket guide will help you--it certainly is not lacking in detail for a small atlas. But if you are trying to find M51, even with the right chart opened before you, you may have difficulty placing that piece of sky in relationship to what you see over your head.  OK. So what's better? For a pocket guide, I greatly prefer "Objects in the Heavens" by Peter Birrin.  His pocket guide is far more logically designed and contains much, much more information. I personally have purchased many of Peter's guides and given them as gifts to budding astronomers and each time they just seemed to know what to do with his book. I doubt that will be the experience I have when I give away the extra copy of this pocket guide.  Will I keep mine? Sure. I can make use of it. Do I recommend it? Only if you're a collector of atlases...Try Objects in the Heavens instead.  CoffeeMan  
 I returned it even though i had to pay to ship it back! Should not be a kids book, it had very few pictures and no color 
 What can I say? I would've been disappointed if I'd only rented this DVD, let alone bought it. Like the other reviewers, i too have been a seagal fan since Above the Law. His movies have been going down hill recently - but there have at least been some saving qualities amongst them! Attack force is pure unadulterated insidious crap. If you haven't stuck cutlery (or any convenient household utensil) into your ears by the half way point, there's something wrong with you. The voice dubbing is pathetic. A female voice with an indian accent would sound closer to Mr Seagal's own voice than the gravelly whisp that emanated from his mouth for most of the dialogue.  Maybe that's the movie's saving grace: you can't turn away - if you do, you won't know who's talking 
 I found the book to have basic common sense information, no real ideas! It was one of 3 books that I purchased and I ended up returning the book and keeping the other 2 books. But, if you need help with how to get organized,  this is the book for you! The cover and title are misleading 
 making clothes....think of the Butlerian strategy of it all!  Are they undoing gender? Wow! And on pennies a day, too!  Think of the androgynous gay boy who might wear the same clothes as his bestest girlfriend. Think of the subversiveness of it all!  Consider the fact that maybe the slave woman in Honduras made those clothes!  How Butlerian, indeed! 
 An entertaining, albeit fatuous, peon to American radio. The research is superficial and many of the facts wrong or incomplete 
 There is no way one can honestly call this Indiana Jones music with a clear conscience. The chords are off, and some of the songs are even missing NOTES! They slur when they aren't supposed to, they're giving John Williams THE GREAT a bad name! Indiana Jones movies are best ever in the entire world, and this "soundtrack" or "recording" or WHATEVER it's SUPPOSED TO BE, is dragging them through the mud! Horrible. 
 I had purchased a rifle from Airslat and it broke after 3 minutes of use.  The quality was not good, but, the customer service of this company is the worst i have ever dealt with.  It has been 2 weeks and no replacement has been shipped.  i have had every excuse imaginable, first they wanted me to pay for shipping, then they wanted me to pay full price for another gun, then they said they did not have that model any longer and I would have to pay for the higher priced model.  i still have not been refunded or had the item replaced.  i have spent hours trying to get this taken care of with no progress.  the worst customer service of all time! 
 It takes a lot of time (or it seams that way) to get through this book.   I do not know what slowed me down more, the disjointed writing or the plot that seamed to just be thrown together.   I only made it about half way into the book.   I thought there was going to be a mystery here somewhere - maybe that is the mystery.  I got to think after awhile that the author was leaving out about every third sentence, it just made that little sense.   There are many better books out there 
 I am not saying dont buy this one. But beware that this is a only 128 pg book and all of the foldings and designs are basic. I believe a good graphic designer can create the same die-cuts and designs in a very short time. No trade secrets or big creativity involved 
 As far as style of thinking is concerned, Dr. Mallove is far closer to, e.g., creationists than to, e.g., Carl Sagan.  He has let his intense messianic desire that cold fusion be a reality completely cloud his  scientific judgement.  The loony, physics-ignorant hordes of cold-fusion  advocates include such worthies as a fellow in Australia who has sold kits  of magnets and a ball-bearing which he has claimed will roll around a  closed track forever with no visible means of propulsion.  Dr. Mallove does  not refute such garbage.  In this reviewer's opinion he is either  delusional or simply a con man on a par with Erich von Daniken or Whitley  Strieber 
 If anybody else has read my review for an N'sync album, I stated quite clearly that only 1 good song was on that album. I meant this album.   That still means both albums AND bands suck big time! 
 The first two books in this series (Outfoxed and Hotspur) were great--I couldn't put them down!  And God knows I've stayed up way past my bedtime on a work night so I could finish a Mrs. Murphy story.  But this one?!  Slow cannot begin to describe it!  What a big disappointment!  
 I had high hopes for this book as I thought it would address spirituality in a humanistic way.  At first, I thought I agreed with the 'accepting of self' philosophy, but gradually statements made by the author just didn't ring true.  I kept on thinking that maybe I was resistant to the reevaluation of my own thought processes, but gave up when the author spoke of a patient who found out her husband was cheating on her and the author's response was that she had control issues (!?!) and was acting like a victim.  I think at that moment, perhaps she feeling victimized.  But instead of telling her to 'embrace her victim', she is a control freak. Then he presents depression like it is some kind of choice, instead of a chemical imbalance.  Perhaps depression can spawn creativity, but you have to be able to get out of bed first -- and that is a problem.  I gave up on the book after that 
 Be aware that you may share this same experience if you download the book.  After the book was downloaded to my computer, I was prevented from printing past the first 60 pages due to properties designed into the file.  The book is over 300 pages.    In order for me to receive a printed copy of the entire book, it will be necessary for me to have the hard copy sent to me.  Since I do wish to have the hard copy, I will reorder and pay the shipping and the cost of another copy of the book 
 Where in the world is the 2nd Disc to the Tarzan Special Edition I was told about in the commerical? This is complete false advertisement. I bought this DVD thinking there where 2-Discs. Disney really messed up on this one. They need to send all owner's of this crappy So-called Special Edition a free copy of the next Tarzan release(which will probably be a 2 Disc DVD) or refund unsatisfied customers money back. I will think twice about buying certain Disney movies in the future.    I am also upset about the "New Groove Edtion" of The Emperor's New Groove. This is for the most part the same DVD as the previous released. Down to the content and even the menus. The only thing really new is 2 more deleted scenes.  I am totally upset about this situation. I can not return these DVD's to the store because the DVD's are opened. The only way I could know this was not what I wanted was to open the DVD's. As a customer what do you do when the stores have a no return policy on open DVD's.  Total Disappointment 
 First one didn't work, got a replacement - both easy to put music on the device but the music will not play ... very clugy button setup and even the neighborhood tekky kid couldn't get the songs downloaded to play - don't buy this item! 
 The book is well written but lacks in breadth of manager case studies. So much of the book is written toward financial institution managers that it has little applicability to managerial positions in manufacturing, engineering, or other disciplines that don't involve motivating people to meet their sales quotas 
 I bought the book on impulse... the title caught my eye, the first story was very interesting, AND the book was small enough to fit neatly into my tote bag...Big Mistake. I loved the first story,( the one about the family that had a child die in the snow and wasn't found until spring) second story I thought was odd but finished it anyway. Third story I was saying "whattt is he is talking about? didn't finish that one... fourth up struggled through that one. Fifth story, again I just couldn't make head nor tails about it.After that, feeling very let down and disapointed I put it away. I went  back to my local INDEPENDENT book store, threw myself at their mercy and they let me return it. PHEW 
 The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.    Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.    Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.    And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.    Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".  By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.    This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.

 Elizabeth Bowen was a sadist. Read this book if you like torture 
 Given high acclaims this film has collected over time, I was glad to pick up a VHS copy at my local library sale.  Began to watch it last night.  I was able to sit thru the part 1.  When the tape ended, I was actually glad. I felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1!  The movie is DREARY to the max.  People portrayed are irrational, lost, uncommunicative, and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers.  In some way, this movie reminded me of the dreary winter (lasting 6 months!) I spent in Russia a couple of years ago...   To me, the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of Soviet state (1920-1956).  For survivors, nothing made any sense anymore, except perhaps fear and evil, as people in this dreary film reflects.  People have been already destroyed in their souls.  They are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the Bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience.   Maybe that is the real meaning of this movie.  To really reflect what happened to people's psyche after Lenin and Stalin's UNLIMITED TERROR, they found a parallel in Mongol's devastation and oppression of medieval Russia.  In both cases, people were left shattered, helpless, irrational, withdrawn,  and autistic.   
 This CD is a good mix of the great ladies of jazz; however the master is the original, without any ounce of technology. I have heard new compilations, and they modify the sound, for hearing as new record, not as a phone call.   However, in matters of pleassure there are no limits, and there would be some one who loves it 
 Relevant material is buried underneath too much theory.  Not enough examples.  I bought this book to supplement another book to and I had to buy another one to supplement this one 
 After reading several books about the Founding Fathers and other Presidents, I was excited to read about Teddy.  Now in most books they discuss personalities, events, and impacts of decisions.  This book read like a cheesy novel with unncessary flowery language.  There are lines that were shown as dialogue, when the information was probably gleened from several correspondence.  He writes about facial expressions during conversations.  Morris even wrote about what they thought during events.  Most writers would state, "He would recall later..."  If I had wanted to read a novel, I would have.  I was disappointed not with the subject, just the way it was written.   
 This is on the overall a good book as the other reviews have testified.  There is one major problem, the author talks very little about risk.  She recommends that you get deeply into debt and use that leverage to make money.  That's ok and many people have made money that way.  Many people have also lost their shirt that well as well.  The book would have been much enhanced is she spent a chapter talking about the risks involved with taking on massive amounts of debt, especially for the small investor - the target audience - who likely doesn't have much to lose.  She should've included several case studies, some that look those who have successfully used leverage (debt), and looked at some who lost everything.  Then she could've analyzed what were the underlying factors and decisions that led to either failure or success.  Instead the author casts debt in an overly positive light, saying almost nothing about the risks involved.  This is all well for her, she began to buy several years before the biggest real estate boom in the history of the country.  But there have been plenty of real estate markets in the past where investors took on too much debt and lost not only their investment properties, but everything else as well.  Any credible book about investing has a responsibility to spend a healthy amount of time discussing risk.  It's like being enthusiastic about a medication but not saying anything about the potential side effects or hazards.  Such an approach is bad medicine, and Ms. Thomas' book is bad teaching because she ignores the subject of debt, and for that reason I took off 3 stars.    Beyond that, it's a very good starter book.  
   This is bring to your notice that the product that i have orderd has not reached me yet. I request you to do the needful. Thanking you Prince Georg 
 It was very weird because he never used proper English and always said cos instead of because and there are so many random words that have been fully capitalized.  I still have not finished the book but it takes a while for me to read it because of the confusing plot.  Recently a couple times I have had to re-read the part before so I can understand it.  In my opinion, if you are looking for the intense book that the back says you will be fooled.  I went into the bookstore and read the back and thought it looked interesting, but when I got home and began reading it...it was a totally different book than it says.  Do not buy this book if your daughter or son likes suspense book because it isn't. 
 We read this book for our book club, and the overall feeling was that it was a quick, easy read, but very predictable and a little over the top.  We all agreed that we wouldn't be passing this book on to friends to read as we did not enjoy it that much 
 The Christian idea of Dominionism has been around since the founding of America. In the eyes of non-objective christians everywhere they see modernity as a threat and would be more than satisfied to turn back the dial of time back to the 1950's - quaint white suburbs of jesus praisin' and boredom. They feel that they have a divine duty to take control over the government to punish our naughty behaviors of gay marriage, pot smoking, and internet porn.  Somehow they link the downfalls of modern setbacks to our moral behavior. Any rational thinking person knows that this is ludacris. What about the morals and values of George W. Bush's war mongering? What about the morals and values of priests who rape children physically and mentally? What about the morals and values of putting away a father in jail, from his children, because he enjoys smoking marijuana casually?   Francis Schaeffer attemps to explain why morality and freedom have crumbled in our society. His solution is ironically to restrict freedom by reverting to the very virus that gave us the Crusades and the Inquisition - accepting the bible as truth and accepting Jesus as your savior.  Jesus died for his own sins not mine.  I was unfortunately raised as a Christian Catholic and it took me until I got into college to undo this henious mind virus.  Luckily I'm sure this county will never subscibe to this "Protocols of the Christian Elders" horsesh*t 
 This is a strange little book.  The intention is good, love conquers all, dealing with aging, etc...  However,it is full of negative images, and frankly is...creepy.  When the boy is awake, he is exasperating, annoying, foul mouthed, and strange.  The only time the mother shows her love is by furtively entering her son's room and singing her little love ditty.  For what it's worth, my wife hates it too and refers to it as "The stalking story."  It has been unceremoniously pitched out of our house.  If you want a better rendition of this sort of thing, try The Runaway Bunny, or Guess How Much I Love You 
 With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love.  This film felt like a "blind date" gone bad.  The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.  Everything in this film seemed wrong.  Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.  What initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose.  Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the cliché use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame.  Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale.  She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes.  I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors.  Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth.  Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally.  Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen.  I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character.  His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant.  I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.  Speaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film?  There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' "Looking at America" class.  I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film.  Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn.  There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about.  I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film.  He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for.  I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way.  Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well.  Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature.  Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story.  I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met.  I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.  Overall, I wasn't stunned by this picture.  I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just "played it safe".  The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin.  Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character?  I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters.  The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table.  I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further.  Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film.  The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old.  I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be!  Grade: ** out of **** 
 Unless you have to read everything Faulkner wrote, save your time here.  It's better than Soldier's Pay, Mosquitoes, and Sanctuary, but that isn't much to aspire to.  Here and there an interesting thought comes up, but if you're short on time or energy, spend it working through Absalom, Absalom!  That will save your soul.  You can listen to Jagger sing Parachute Woman and get the same material  in a better medium.  Pylon, however, is a good word 
 Anyone who looks at a person from Tamilnadu in the south and a person from Uttar Pradesh in the north can tell that 'India' is not made up of one racial type.  'Aryans' live in the north, the further north the more pure, and 'Dravidians' in the south, the further south the more pure blooded.  There was an Aryan invasion, saying otherwise is merely reactionary nonsense, designed to undermine the achievements of the Dravidian people 
 Having liked "Sixth Sense" very much, I was hoping to see another good movie from the same director. Sadly, this was not the case. I like science fiction, I like movies about the supernatural, I like mysteries, and I love comic books. I also appreciate thoughtful and thought-provoking explorations of racial issues. This movie had a lot of potential but instead just made a silly muddle out of everything.  
 ,,, instead of dispassionate, reasoned argument. Faludi interprets everything, *everything*, as proof of her argument that a "war" has been declared against women. There are no shades of grey, and no counterarguments in Faludi's book. This makes me wonder just how carefully she did her research; assumning she dug deeply enough, did she just disregard anything that didn't tend to support her point of view? I have worked hard to get a JD and an MBA, and if that education has given me only one great lesson, it's that you cannot ignore real contrary evidence (and it's always out there); you might not like it, but you must address it.  I'm a woman in my 50s, and I believe that, with friends like Faludi, women don't need enemies. If ever a man described women as inferior to men in terms of capacity for reasoned argument, all he'd need to do to prove his point is refer to Faludi's screed.   Faludi's book is geared to the sheep among women and the ignorant among young girls. Academics are bound to eat it up, unfortunately; particularly those poor disenfranchised tenured female professors.   
 I heard Richard Jeni on XM Radio some time ago, and thought he was extremely funny.  I ordered this DVD and expected to hear some of the same material on it.  But I was disappointed, this DVD was mildly funny, don't waste your money on this DVD 
 Was given this book as a freebie--someone must be buying up copies.  For an Austinite, this adoring account of the life of a hasbeen fifth-string techno-celebrity is a little embarrassing in its breathlessness--kind of reminds one of the courtiers who saluted when Louis the XIV's chamber pot was carried by, except this isn't the Sun King, guys.  Get a life, or at least an authentic artist to swoon over--all of Garriott's stuff was strictly derivative.  Now that we have the real Lord of the Rings to watch, who cares about cheap imitations 
 Bought this CD only to get the elusive original 12" version of Pet Shop Boys' "West End Girls."  The CD cover says it contains "All full length extended versions."  Not true.  "West End Girls" has been cut down by at least two minutes, and the edits aren't particularly clean.  All the rest of the songs sound strikingly similar, as if all the artists had to share the same drum machine and synthesizer.  Quite repetitive and not terribly interesting 
 The book shows how innocent and peace-loving the Israeli government has been since the beginning of time, to only be "balanced" by how cruel and war-mongering the Palestinians have been.  If you are a fan of Israel, you will love this book.  If you are a fan of Palestine, you will hate it.  If you are in the middle, I only hope you will be able to sort out where the truth ends and the fiction begins before forming an opinion of the Middle East.  Bottom line, the "settlers" and Hamas are exactly the same mentality, while the remaining 80% of both populations are caught in the endless trap of -- "He hit me!!" "Yeah, but he hit me first!!"       
 The rhythms in this music are so monotonous, songs go on and on and on, with no direction, as if the songwriter didn't know how to end the song.  Very disappointed in this because an intelligent person recommended this album and I expected much much better.     Just a bunch of over-drugged and over-sexed punks, no role models here!    I don't recomend you buy this one.   
 This novel was a big disappointment to me.  It began with great promise but then fell apart at its midpoint.  I can only conclude that Ms. Aikens was writing under a deadline because the resolution of the various plot lines in the novel's concluding scene is ludicrous and unsatisfactory.  So save your money for another book 
 This book was not at all what I expected from Brands, who was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his biography of Benjamin Franklin, First American.  In trying to make an academic biography accessible to the reading public, Brands' writing suffers greatly and becomes far too colloquial.  At one point, when discussing Indian-White relations, he goes so far as to call the whites "Palefaces."  It was a chore to get through, and while it heightened my knowledge of Jackson, nothing was particularly memorable except what I already knew or, perhaps, the actions I disagreed with (his invasion of Florida or his use of martial law after the Battle of New Orleans).  Particularly when discussing Jackson's historically far reaching actions, such as kicking the Cherokees out of Georgia, or his battle with Biddle and eventual destruction of the Bank of the United States, Brands does a deplorable job of explaining what happened.  Elements of background, and why Jackson did whatever it was he did exactly, as the reader will be confused on that point, are conspicuously missing.  I have read similarly poor reviews of another biography by Brands, TR: The Last Romantic, and if First American is at all similar in style, I know why he didn't win that Pulitzer 
 Dull and inane come to mind. Consists mostly of Peabody's artificially "catty" - sometimes racist - first-person remarks about everyone she meets (even the cat), fuzzy descriptions of Egyptian "archaeology" (...). The plot is slow moving, cliché and peopled with characters that come across as cardboard cutouts. I found more of pennance than pleasure in this read. Avoid it 
 Although the maps were helpful, much of this book seemed outdated.  Addresses were wrong, business gone and reviews questionable 
 The first thing that you'll notice is that this is a skimpy, short book at 134 pages (160 if you include the appendices).  This would be ok if the content was substantial and useful.  Unfortunately, it provides a very introductory, shallow overview of the covered call writing strategy.  This too would be ok if this was a $15 quick read paperback, but it's an expensive hardcover (which is not worth the price).  I'd suggest the interested reader should check other books on the subject instead 
 This book is a nihilistic, incoherent work, and I dare anyone who reads this review to argue to the contrary.  Admiration for this book is humbuggery in action.  The emperor has no clothes 
 While some of the book is ok, in general it is in dire need of a update. It's quite obvious that the photos etc contained in it are dated and non-current. I wouldn't recommend it 
 This book is what you get when a guide decides to fulfil its minimum responsibilities of being an official guide. Walkthrough? Checked. Characters profile? Checked. Bestiary list? Checked. Maps? Checked.  So, what's not good about it? Well, there's plenty.   Let's first talk about the walkthrough. Is it really that difficult for strategy guides to provide a decent walkthrough these days? On first looks, this guide follows a sequence of explanation that I prefer. That is, to label important points on the various location maps, and then explain what events to look out for at these points in words. Unfortunately, the explanation is usually too brief, and doesn't provide much details. You can do yourself a favor and go find a better walkthrough on GameFAQs.com, for example.  Next, the characters and enemies profile. The characters profile is ok, and has the initiative to list down the various skills and possible commands for each character. That's good. But the bestiary list is really a big mess. Why, I mean, why, did Nintendo Power chose to present the list in alphabetical order? Imagine yourself in a player's shoes. You find yourself completing the game, only to miss, say, ten enemies undefeated. You decide buy a guide to help you find the remaining enemies, and then find that the list is so jumbled up, it takes you five minutes to find just one of them. You see, in the game, each enemy is numbered, and they're usually numbered in accordance to when they appear. So, an enemy with a name beginning with the letter "A" may be Enemy# 250 in the game, for instance, and yet, will appear first on this book's bestiary list. I think you can imagine how difficult it's going to be if you're missing Enemy# 51, and have no idea what his or her name is.  The only things that are remotely good about this book are the maps. I appreciate that there's a triple-folded attachment that has an Overworld, Underworld and Lunar map on it. But even so, the usefulness of the maps is somewhat limited, because instead of typing the names of the respective locations on the map, they somehow decided to use labels to mark them. You're then required to refer to a legend to find out what these labels are. Perhaps it's just to show uniformity, but while the label method works for a walkthrough, it certainly doesn't work for a map. I mean, we're talking about over 20 locations on the Overworld map itself. If I've to urgently look for a location, I'd have no idea what the labels are when I look at the map. I'd then have to actually look at the legend to find the place I want, and then go back to the map to find where it's located. It's a little silly - the maps are definitely large enough for words to fit in, so it baffles me as to why labels are used.  Last but not least, where's the walkthrough for Lunar Ruins? Ok, granted that this additional dungeon has randomized levels. But surely, a description of each of the character's trials in it, which are fixed, won't take more than a few pages? Instead, only one miserable page was dedicated to "briefly explain" this unlockable dungeon. Hey, I've already bought a guide. I'm prepared to be spoiled. There's no need to avoid spoilers.  So, where do these leave this book? A faraway distance from a good guide, that's where. I collect strategy guides, especially for games that I enjoy playing. I access its helpfulness after I beat the game - I'm already at Level 94 when I bought this, and have completed all trials in Lunar Ruins, by the way - and I found this book not helpful in many areas. If this is what they think an official guide is all about, then they should really think again 
    I found the first 50 pages or so to be intriguing, after that it became a grind to endure. Mr. Gardner makes very indirect references to the impact of the media on the vignettes that he recounts, yet seemingly asserts that the individuals involved acted in a vacuum.    The author credits Bill Clinton with single handedly coming up with "mend it, don't end it" for welfare, yet does not explain how the Republican congress of 94 had any part in this course of action.      Darwin is treated as an infallible truth, yet Mr. Gardner does not address the lack of transitional forms, the various "truths" that are allowed to exist, like the stages of the human embryo [fish, primate with tail] and the lack of any new species.     The author does have some interesting ideas, yet the simplistic characterization of the people or ideas that he analyzes [see the part on George Bush] fails to allow us, the readers, to form a realistic idea of the forces acting on them.     So how do I change minds 
 This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9. Opens files that I've been using for years and then writes scribbled, unopenable 'saved' versions. Crashes. Can't save for mysterious reasons. Writes "version 10" files with text split into pieces.  Such a fine product! Really glad I paid money for it!!  I downgraded back to Irritator 10 
 I watched this dogg-o with some Japanese folks I know and let me tell ya all of thought it was the most boring, obvious, dated bore we'd laid eyes on in many a moon. And these guys are from a very wealthy, aristocratic, old Japanese family at the vanguard of Westernization in the 50s. STAY AWA 
 I have the Institutes and I have read with careful atention Calvin`s Doctrine of Salvation. He teaches pretty well some  christian truths. He uses the bible and the church fathers, but when Calvin gives his (or Luther`s) peculiar teachings, he shows how unchristian his doctrine really is by NOT quoting a single NT text or church father to support what is nothing more than an heretic view. Just to give an example: he teaches in this book that the good works of the christian stink, smell horrible, but Calvin doesn`t give a single quote from the NT or the fathers to support this view. His teaching is clearly anti biblical. One more: When he teaches about Righteousness he never quotes Matthew 5:20. In this text Jesus tells us that if our justice is not superior than the scribes' we won`t enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Justice for Matthew is good work of love for God and the needy (Mt 6:1). Calvin simply doesn`t quote this biblical text, and just read his commentary on his "Harmony of the Gospels" and you will see how in some 29 lines Calvin just run from the simple sense of this text, and that`s because Mt 5:20 goes against his doctrine (salvation by faith alone).  Calvin taught that salvation can`t be lost, even tough this doctrine wasn`t taught by the church fathers (not even by Augustine). Read Daniel Corner`s Conditional Security of the believer" Yes you will find in this book his classic insult to God: that He has predestined some people to hell. And Calvin`s use of violence to support his views is well known. Let`s reread the Bible without Calvin`s lens.  
 This book is way overated.  Its way-out, wacky treament of electronics could definitely not be that of any well thought-of engineer.  It's frankly just a bunch of goofy unsystematic mumbo-jumbo by some over-educated self-proclaimed "physicists."   So imagine my surprise when I read a translation of this in Russian.  I think the whole world must have been duped.  Do yourself a favor.  Go read the Smith book (see my other reviews) and avoid this one like the plague 
 i just bought this book.  i wouldn't say it's crap, but it isn't worth much. first, the images aren't as luminous as ingres actual paintings, at all. whoever put the images in this book is an idiot because almost every piece has been significantly cropped. what made ingres especially interesting were his compositions. it's very hard to admire his compositions WHEN THEY'RE CUT OFF! the figures skin doesn't glow, many of his most important pieces aren't in color or are very shrunken down (not even 1/4 of a page). plus, there's so much bullcrap written in this book and there really aren't many color plates!  this book is HUGE (fat)-the only book i have that's larger is a catalogue from the morandi museum in bologna. however, there's probably fewer color plates in this book than many I own HALF that size. there's several drawings, which are excellent, but it's really easy to find books of his drawings for a fraction of the price.   this book isn't horrible, but i'm especially frustrated with having spent over $200 last week on sargent books and this one, and both have lousy quality images, very few that one could learn from. i'm a painter, so when i look at these books, i look for technique, skill, good quality, clear images. this book, in addition to the sargent 3 volume portrait series, seriously lack images that one could learn anything from. 
 Great book on this classic strategy. Thorp got even richer using a similar system in the stock market. (Although it was during the bull years...)  Not suited for the less then occasional player or in general any player who's familiar with the game's rules in other languages.  
 This is a breezy, poorly-written account that over-emphasizes SC's importance during the late stages of the war, at the expense of Naval affairs and the Yorktown campaign.  VERY little original research done for this book (if any) and author resorts to all sorts of fables and myths that have been debunked years ago. Advice: skip it. 
 Not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  Even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...STOP..you hair feels very damaged.  It goes back to normal texture if I use my other shampoos.  I made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the Jonathan shampoo..and it was.  It went into the trash.  Don't purchase this stuff...unless you're going for the scarecrow look 
 This book was recommended reading during my studies on interior design, so I bought it without really looking into it.  I was disappointed.  Maybe I expected too much, maybe the title misled me, but it seemed very much based on thumbnail sketches and it wasn't what I was looking for.  It is a thin little book full of rough pencil sketches that you could easily lose down the back of the sofa! (in a nutshell). I wanted to know the more indepth technical ways of doing perspectives and this book left me in the dark.  
 I must admit, I kind of like Matchbox 20. I never went out and bought their albums, but songs like "Push" and "The Real World" do bring back some good memories of the mid-to-late-90's (although the late '90s was when pop culture first began to truly suffer).  But in the last year or two, I've been noticing a very annoying song, mostly on radio. It sounds like a Justin Gimplerfake "song", with its sophomoric keyboard beat, and its grating vocals, complete with the ultra-annoying "OH-oh-oh-oh!". I didn't know who bleated out this wretched abomination, I just assumed it was some hack like the previously mentioned has-been Gimplerfake (actually, scratch "has-been", "never-was" is more like it).  Now I find out it's Matchbox 20 frontman Rob Thomas? Say WHAAA?!? How did he go from decent songs like "Push" to THIS garbage?!?  Sigh. Rob Thomas is another casualty of the hellish 2000s. I'm done. NEXT 
 This product is not worth the price by itself.  It's fair at buy-1-get-4-free.  The time function works fine.  The compass, on the other hand, is virtually useless.  Having gotten 5 watches, all 5 compasses were pointing in different directions 
 It doesn't work as it states that it should.  My 6 year old doesn't even try to get it to work right anymore. At Christmas we followed the directions closely.  It doesn't really tell you when you are warmer, and even when we stood right in front of it, it didn't say we had found it.   This was a waste of $30.00.  If your child really wants it, try to steer her elsewhere.  This is not a good toy.    I suggest the game Hide & Seek Safari as an alternative.  It works great and is fun for all ages.    
 If you believe that a Computer projection of Hurricane's behavior is better than human evaluation,then this is your book.Jack Williams of USA TODAY gives us a dumbed down version of science that his newspaper specializes in.Want a terrible sounding MEOW?Well, a computer can do it for you without any reference for historical record.I recommend reading Dunn's ATLANTIC HURRICANES or even Hearn's CHITA so you can start evaluating Hurricanes on your own terms 
 Rilke is just about my favourite poet... a true master.  In the German, his verse is just sublime.  These translations, however, are shockingly bad.  Not only does the translator completely ignore (or distort) some of the key images, he invents new ones for no apparent reason.   Mitchell seems to think he is there to improve on the original.  He doesn't.  If you don't read German, you should only buy this to read Mitchell's verse.  You won't be getting Rilke's 
 When I was buying this, I did not know much about Muddy's or Wolf's discography, and I didn't bother reading any reviews.  In fact, I first thought it might be Muddy's own original CD called "Muddy and the Wolf" for some strange reason.  It isn't.  Half of this CD is Muddy Waters, and the other half is Howlin' Wolf.  This is not a collaboration either.  This is SOME of the material taken from Muddy's highly acclaimed Fathers and Sons CD and SOME of the material taken from Wolf's London Sessions and basically glued together into one incomplete disc.  If you think you want a *sample* of either man's style, this is probably a bad place to start because it only represents Muddy late in his career doing electrical blues and Wolf in a once-in-a-lifetime collaboration with the British rockers in London.  Not a typical sample of each man's career at all.  I do own Wolf's London Sessions and find them interesting material, but they are not by any means a true representation of the bluesman that Wolf was.  As for Muddy, you'd do much better just getting his Fathers and Sons CD.  Save your money here 
 I'm no prude, but some of the actions described in this book go beyond crude to disgusting and repulsive.  Who needs to waste time reading about such behavior?  Don't we see enough of the depths of human depravity on the news? I would have expected a huge protest from families of middle class black people, who are portayed with every variety of perversion and obsession...the only ones who are shown as decent human beings are strange in their own ways, nonformist to the extreme. 
 Yes it's alternate all right- as in the authors ARE NOT historians and just make it up as they go along.  I read through the previous reviews and only counted 5 (?) negatives which only proves that the detractors did not feel compelled to expend effort on a story they didn't like or the positive writers were smoking some good stuff and didn't really remember too much of what they read.  I read each of the NEGS to be sure I didn't rehash prior arguments.  Straight off I was discouraged by the complete lack of knowledge and/or research in their project.  On page 33 there is a description of the "Nineteenth AD" division insignia; "a white star on a badge of crimson".  HOLY COW Batman, US armored divions, then as now, all use a triangular patch of red, blue and yellow with their numeric designation centered in the bottom half.  Question to the authors... what the (heck) is a Schmeisser?  It is not a German SMG as the authors in child-like enthusiam repeatedly misuse the term.  You might say, "bah these are small things" but they are indemic of a poorly crafted work.  I am struggling mightily to finish this horrid tale as I am stubborn and refuse to let a book "beat me" but I have already binned my mass-back copy of the follow-on Fox on the Front UNREAD.  Fool me once, shame on you-fool me twice shame on me!  
 I am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book.  Honestly, it was a complete waste of my time.  To quote a friend, it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar.  If you are a fan of pedestrian writing, lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development, this is your book 
 I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend this novel. Unless you've had the exact same tragic events happen to you, there is no way of relating to the characters 
 This is the sadest little book ever! After reading Will Clower's "Fat Fallacy", and becoming a big fan of "eating for pleasure", I wanted to find more books on the topic and came across the reviews for "The Martini Diet", in which one of the readers compared this book to Mr. Clower's- immediately stirring my interest. But unlike the "Fat Fallacy"- written in an intelligent, constantly providing scientific facts- sort of way, which convinced me to adopt the life style in the first place, Jennifer Sander's book is written on a middle/highschool level and I found it close to unbearable to read. If I haden't read the "Fat Fallacy" first, I'd have no idea what this woman was talking about and would assume that this was something she and her "big-big" friends (Her words, not mine!) came up with while sipping on Martini's.  If she's not constantly talking about "putting Martini glasses down" to engage in other activities(is she an alcoholic?), she contradicts and repeats herself over and over again: -Like stating that she enjoys the Slim Fast Shakes and breakfast bars, which substitue for a REAL breakfast. So much about a "real food diet"!  - On page 49 she even advertises calorie counting (and I thought that that was excactely what we didn't want to do anymore!) - And what about her statement, that "real grown ups" are never seen in public drinking anything, including bottled water because that would be tacky!? Hello?  Just to mention a few disturbing things.  I absolutely agree with the outline of this diet, but it couldn't have been advertised any worse than this! "Gin" Sanders seems to want to morphe herself so desperately into Jacky O. and Co., that you can't help but wonder what happened to this woman during her "heftier" day's, to make her completely want to become somebody else. If you are not interested in turning yourself into a "wannabe" socialite with a few simple tricks from "Gin", but would like a great- new approach to nutrition, explained with adult reasoning, then I suggest you read William Clower's "Fat Fallacy" instead!  This could have really been a great book... : 
 I purchased this radio because our favorite smooth-jazz station became a hip-hop station, and we learned that the smooth jazz programming was available on the secondary digital channel.  However, we could not get the second channel to work with any consistency.  It worked in the kitchen, but not in the bedroom, where we had intended to use it.  Another reviewer has commented on the user-unfriendly setup process, and I second those comments totally.  But the deal-killer for me is that it just can't pull in the stations.  I tried everything.  It just doesn't work very well at all.    We live in suburban Dallas.  I'm sending it back.  I NEVER send stuff back, but this was really unsatisfactory 
 I bought this book assuming it would give help in dealing with the  alcoholic but was very disappointed.  If you are doing research this book  may be fine, but it is not for self-help 
 As other reviewers have said, this book is full of cliches and stereotypes.  The childless woman who one day SUDDENLY wakes up and wants kids? Ugh. How tired is that?  And, naturally, she has to be "punished" for not reproducing by getting cancer. Surprise!  The woman whose husband dies and meets the man of her dreams? If your reading taste is at or below Harlequin romances, you'll LOVE this book. Otherwise, stay away 
 This romantic comedy was charming, funny, and clever. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a problem with heavy British accents. (If you do, try it with captions). It was fun, funny, and a nice pick-me-up when one needs a lift 
 Why are Americans so fat? According to this clown, it's because of fast food. Which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves, our laziness, and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline. Gee, I wish Mommy Government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions! Then everything would be right with the world; after all, no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them. Right? People shouldn't have to make decisions for themselves! It's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what's best for ourselves. Someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the Internet 
 This may be entitled "Warner Bros. Classic Holiday Collection," but Warner Bros. had nothing to do with the production or distribution of Boys Town, Men of Boys Town, or the 1938 Christmas Carol. Louis B. Mayer may return to haunt the Christmases of those heretics against the one, true religion of MGM, who purloined Spencer Tracey, Mickey Rooney, and Ann Rutherford to enrich the reputations of Harry, Jack, Abe, and Ted. 
 This is a great movie if you enjoyed watching film strips in 6th grade.  If you pop this baby in your DVD player, you will be asleep within 35 minutes.  This movie makes cocaine dealers out to be criminal masterminds, when all they really are is shady, good for nothing bums. This could have been a 1/2 hour special on the History Channel and, you'd get the same amount of useful information.   Honestly, if you want to get a good idea of this film...just imagine watching an episode of Miami Vice but, subtract all the action scenes 
 I've listened to this piece of work several times, in many positions, on various stero systems, during different moods and I just can't understand the lyrics half the time and the arrangements were best described as 'a wall of mud'.  It isn't a question of country music, or contemporary music, with ELH she has demonstrated throughout the years she just loves, and respects, GOOD MUSIC.  The music is good, the woman has impeccable taste but this time I had wished she sat in on the mixing process.  I think I understand the aim of this collection but geez, I wish I didn't.  I am too accustomed to hearing ELH's clear voice slice to the heart of the lyrics, take them and present them with a totally unique perspective.  I won't start on her own playing because this review would be nothing but gushing about her near-total mastery of her craft.    She's an amazing woman, artist and collaborator -- I love her because she is everywhere in music: supporting new artists, doing background for others, her duets are gems of generosity with respect for her fellow artists, while always doing what's best for the song.  I just hope there's no follow up to WB.    I'm very happy with my other 8 ELH cds and I'm in awe of 'All Roads Running' and my [...]is going to be front center next week in Los Angeles.  It's like waiting for Xmas 
 Fantastic Voyage is the only good song on this excuse for an album.  The rest of the songs are not even the least bit interesting.  The other songs aren't even worth listening to. Unless you are Coolio's #1 fan, then don't  this unless it's used for real cheap.  None of the songs seem like  "fantastic voyage" and that is what turned me off 
 Great listening, but the production is so poorly conceived and gimicky that it is impossible to watch. A terrible disappointment 
 Be warned. If you're looking for the exciting true story about how one man revitalized a city in decline and truly modernized Las Vegas through vision and guts (as I was), you won't find it here.  This is not a book about Steve Wynn transforming Las Vegas. This is a tabloid hit job written by a hostile author who has only one objective: link Steve Wynn to the mob.  As a Vegas history buff and as someone who's interested in Wynn, let me concede the author's objective up front: okay sure. Of course Wynn knows mafia wiseguys. How could he not? How could Wynn arrive as a young man in Vegas in the 60s and climb the ladder of influence without making mob contacts? The mob ran the town! The only real surprise as far as I'm concerned is how little Wynn seems to be involved with the mafia.  It's not that I'm a huge fan of Wynn, and all of Smith's secondhand accounts of Wynn behaving like a spoiled brat in private seem plausable, but since it's so obvious that the author  is laser-focused on smearing Wynn, who's to say I'm getting a balanced account?   Whole chapters are devoted to little more than proving that Wynn is friends with this particular mob middleman, and on this particular day in 1982, they were SEEN HAVING LUNCH at this particular bistro. Though Wynn would always deny that the lunch took place, that's not the recollection of this busboy, who we've  tracked down, who was ACTUALLY THERE. etc. etc. This is the book.  I was most looking forward to a retelling of the story of how Wynn built the Mirage. Where did he get the inspiration? How was it financed? How did he pitch it to investors? How did it get built? What were the expectations? How was it received when it opened? How did it change the texture of the strip? We get none of that. Instead, around two-thirds of the way through the book, I turn the page, and the Mirage is suddenly there, no discussion, and we're hearing about how one of the casino hosts may have had mob ties. Weak sauce.  Look, maybe what Smith needed was an opening chapter stating what he was trying to achieve. He could have made a case that although Wynn has transformed the city and done some great things, he's not completely squeaky-clean and has gone to great lengths to hide his association to organized crime. He could have made the moral case about taking money from the mob, and then said explicitly that the purpose of the book was to air out Wynn's dirty laundry and to take the man down a notch. What we get instead is an account of Wynn that purports to be evenhanded and journalistic but is truly only interested in smearing the man.   If the popular positive image of Wynn as humanitarian and brilliant entrepeneur who saved Vegas isn't wholly correct, then Smith's problem is that he goes directly to the opposite extreme, painting Wynn as a greedy, slimy criminal. Maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle? Maybe that's a book I would want to read 
 This is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book. This book, in my opinion, is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders. A complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance. Take time researching this book before you buy it because it's the worst book I've ever purchased. 
 This book is a joke.Ms.Brown is being portrayed as a innocent bambi in the Hollywood hills.Spare me! OJ's defence team should have let the evidence & facts do the talking.The facts-Nicole had party-people,like Cato Calin,hanging around and consuming things.She had a lavish monthly allowance,such as $4,000 per month ,for eating expenses,for herself and the two children.)That's alot pasta!  She had instructed some hanger-ons to leave and not to return.After another evening out, at the Mezza-Luna Ristorante ,and again she leaves her sunglasses (a code to Ron Goldman,it's play-time!)Ron Goldman knew exactly how to get to Nicole's place,as if it was routine.Ron told his boss,"He'll run it(the glasses)right over to her."(He's a liebermann or a liebknecht,really).I'm asuming after his workday.Evidence-Now,if Nicole's porch became a bloodbath,the killer (or killers)would be sullied in blood.And the state claims to have found a spot of blood,in OJ's Bronco.Well,that blood-speck was not even conclusively linked to OJ's blood-DNA.(It's similar to the Lizzie Bordon case,in which Lizzie claimed she had crushed a beetle-bug on her dress,when interogated about a blood speck on her dress.Years later,Lizzie's claim was validated through more advanced testing and determined to was of a non-mammal origin.)Lastly, many claim OJ's fleeing in the Bronco,is proof of guilt.Well,if you had at least a dozen white cops ,on your tail,in the aftermath of the Rodney King beating,would you stop for a chat??I still say Nicole was mixed-up with some shady-characters,who saw her place as real cozy to hang-out at ,while their talent agents get back to them .Or the next drug-buy location was being set-up. So my pretties,keep your daughters off the yellow-brick road! HeHeHe!(Update-Nov.21-O.J was contacted by the Fox network and their publisher.O.J already made his statements about what he believed happened.The Fox News muckrackers were trying to cash-in on an old cold case.I saw a documentary ,last week ,on the E network, about famous Hollywood crimes. The crime-story was altered from the original report.On the E network,they stated that Nicole's mother forgot her prescription eye-glasses at the Mezzaluna ristorante.But the original story,was that Nicole forgot her sun-glasses.So if,the revised story is true,why didn't Nicole's mother have a second pair?Was that her only pair of seeing-glasses?And the revised story,still did not explain how Ron Goldman knew how to get there,so readily.Did he use Map-quest?And were the bodies semi-nude or clothed? The idea that the killer was waiting around outside,and waited for a happen-stance guest-visitor to unexpectly ring the door-bell,and kill both seems unlikely.Why would Simpson risk everything,waiting alongside Nicole's house,for an hour,and expect not to be noticed by barking dogs or inquiring neighbors? If OJ hired a hit-man,the sky would be the limit,for book,media and movie deals,for the hired killer.Even if the hitman,became imprisoned.The case still has many troubling questions and no winners of justice 
 This piece of garbage is not worth your time.Go elsewhere for true amusement. Rediscover Kurt Vonnegut. This entire book is just terrible and was the only thing I had on my cross country flight 
 This is a quick read.  The reason I picked it up was trying to understand why a bully at work had me down.  On pg 224 the matter is addressed, "Frequently there is someone in the workplace who is snappish, constantly angry or agitated, or who has an emotional hair trigger.  The addiction to unhappiness can cause you to take other people's grouchiness personally, when in fact it's not about you but about them.  If these difficult coworkers or managers treat everyone else the same way, there is certainly no reason to feel particularly singled out or attacked.  By taking their behavior personally, you gratify your addiction to unhappiness and ruin an otherwise good day."    Okay... I feel like I've been given a pat on the head and told to run along.    Every problem outlined is blamed on one's parents and sends you back to their previous book, Smart Love, to understand how the failures of your parents are to blame for everything from eating addictions to my problem with a bully.    Having said that, I think they have identified a real issue - it is mysterious but some people do shoot themselves in the foot when life looks good - but this book is a disappointment if you think it will help you overcome this tendency.  The Piepers tout the magic of their therapy sessions which may indeed be true, however this book recycles typical self-help ideas:  make a plan for change and be vigilant that you don't backslide, but mostly they repeat over and over again the idea that you are either preventing yourself from achieving happiness or you are actively choosing to cause your own unhappiness 
 While the illustrations were superb, I think this book ultimately portrays an America more in keeping with Ozzie and Harriet's view of it. I realize it's a children's book, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that its author is looking at America from an ivory tower, separated from earth below by a thick, white--VERY WHITE--cloud cover. As I said, I realize this is a childrens book, but the sad fact is, there are many children in this country that wouldn't recognize its contents, since their America is something completely different. I think rather than these fanciful romps, perhaps Mrs. Cheney--as well as Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Bush--should spend some time among America's poorer children and perhaps write something with which they can identify for a chnge. While a lot of children will enjoy this, I as an adult cannot applaud this work knowing how many children the author's husband and his administration have 'left behind. 
 These rather dated arrangements lack the drama and beauty of the original soundtracks.  Also, the entire album is only 28 minutes long.  It's definitely not worth paying full price for 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 This is a tremendously expensive reference that one should expect to be trustworthy. But it isn't. Nor is it as definitive as should be expected, though it does have some fascinating entries, such as the role of dogs in the history of food. For the price, there should be line drawings for some of the more unusual fruits and veg, because as it is, the verbal descriptions would lead a reader to think that something looked quite different than it does. So I use these two volumes with caution, referencing further anything said here before I take it as a given. Although some other reviewers here have criticized the dryness of style, that is what I want in this sort of thing, so I have no complaints there. Of far more importance is the slant that many of the articles have, which clearly have a political agenda that the information is wrapped around. So, while the bibliographies for same are useful, they also are selectively chosen. Given the guides to food now, and the many histories, I would think that a few books judiciously chosen are better value than this one reference, though if you are monied, this is an interesting addition to your library, to be read with a grain of salt in every 'Oh, my! I didn't know that.' 
 I have read 2 other chem book and found this book is my least favorite. 
 Quoting the first 2 sentences of the book:  "In the American system, citizens were taught that the transfer of political power accompanied elections, formal events when citizens made orderly choices about who shall govern. Very few Americans, therefore, understood that the transfer of power might also occur, more subtly, without elections."  Unfortunately, Greider is right about most Americans' stunning ignorance about how they're really governed, although one could argue that more and more people are waking up to the fact that all is not as it seems on the surface. So far, so good - but then, in the next paragraph, without mentioning the Federal Reserve by name, he says:  "It was part of the national government, yet deliberately set outside the electoral process, insulated from the control of mere politicians."  Good propaganda must be mostly truth to work. As I write, this book has a rating of 4 1/2 stars out of 5. This is an indication that the majority of reviewers have bought into the well spun propaganda Greider delivers.  The Federal Reserve is a 100% privately owned corporation, carefully set up to appear as though it is an arm of government. It was created solely for the benefit of it's shareholders, a significant proportion of which are foreign. Greider could have mentioned this extremely important fact at the outset. Instead he deliberately helps perpetuate the myth that "The Fed" is public.  He spends the rest of the 700+ pages going into excruciating detail about The Fed's decisions and their direct effects on the economy, with a focus on the time of Volcker's reign. If that's what you're looking for, this is the book for you. If you're looking for true insight into The Fed, its origins, who it benefits, and how it directly controls the largest economy in the world (and indirectly many other economies through their privately owned central banks) at the expense of everyone else, then I'd suggest reading "The Creature from Jekyll Island".  Why 1 star? I don't like propaganda deliberately designed to mislead people who are seeking truth about a subject which affects all of us. The few citizens that take the time to research a subject so important to all of us deserve better than to be distracted by true  - but on the whole, irrelevant - information 
 I agree with Jodi (see her review further down) -- Teitelbaum is confused into thinking that the chronic fatigue he experienced as an overworked medical student is the same as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  True CFS (which involves neurologic, endocrine, cardiorespiratory and other abnormalities, not merely extreme fatigue) has far more symptoms than just fatigue.  It's generally a result of a virus, not "burn out".  For those who have real CFS, some of the advice can be hazardous. Experts concur that exercise is detrimental, especially to those in the advanced stages who have viral damage to their heart muscle ... I know several patients who've been rendered permanently bedridden after following misguided advice to exercise their way to health.  In fact, reaction to exercise is one of the ways the experts differentiate between CFS and depression.  (see www.cfsfacts.org for details on this diagnostic shortcut)  I've tried Teitelbaum's Fatigued to Fantastic formula; even at maximum dosage, it didn't put me to sleep.  It might help if you have chronic fatigue (the symptom) from insufficient sleep, but Chronic Fatigue SYNDROME is not sleeping too little, but not feeling refreshed when you wake up even if you've slept 20 hours.  See Jodi's list of good books about the Syndrome (not the symptom); I'd add David S. Bell's "Doctor's Guide to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" as one of my top picks 
 A bunch of lowlifes rip the clothes off of a girl and she stands there naked screaming for minutes. All of the T.R. kids stand around and laugh at this naked girl screaming. The adult gets on the microphone and says "Hey you guys, leave that girl alone, or no punk rock music for you"! This scene was so unbelievably stupid! If a young girl got all of her clother ripped off and was standing in the middle of a public place crying and screaming, no adult would say to "leave her alone" and "knock it off you guys"! So after this moronic scene, we are supposed to like the T. R. kids? Why? Also the racism towards the kids' stepdad was not making me like these losers any more. Are punks supposed to hate black people? No!  This is my review so please click on ther button that says this was not helpful. Then you will be cool and hardcore 
 I bought this thing because I lost a memory mod to a power surge.  It worked fine at first but now it has no battery life.  Recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately - like it was not on a backup at all.  Of course the alarm was still screaming but so what - my computer was already shut off without any warning.  I had this thing for two years but I will be going with a different brand next time 
 I love Tommy Emmanuel..but the previously released DVD in concert is much more to my liking...Tommy playing his great repetoire of standards and originals like nobody else in the world!  This DVD has him singing too  many songs and  a guest female vocalist on at least 4 numbers....I allmost feel its misleading to not have her name on the front of the DVD!  There are many better singers in the world...few better guitarists...stop singing and play 
 Just 16 years apart, Rory Gilmore and her mother Lorelai are best friends. They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.   In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.   Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark throughout the seasons -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.   Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky "townie" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.   In this season, Luke and Lorelai FINALLY become engaged...making the dreams of many fans become a reality after six years of flirtation. However, just as they've settled into a comfortable routine, Luke learns of a 12-year-old daughter he never knew he had. As if the plot weren't stupid enough, April is essentially a younger version of Rory -- smart, bookish, loquacious and endearingly geeky. Why couldn't they just have given more emphasis on the relationship between Luke and Rory? It's hard to figure out what on earth the writers were thinking -- IF they were at all, that is. 
 I read the reviews on this book and decided to pick it up along with Vik Orenstein's.  Orenstein's is definitely the better choice for my style.  I have been photographing children for ten years and was looking for some fresh poses and ideas, and I found neither in Sholin's book.  The shots are all poorly lit, boring stock studio photographs, like you would expect from a mall photo mill.  If you are just getting into the children's portrait business and want to be more than just a stand-and-shoot photographer, this is NOT the book for you.  For ideas on developing an interesting, fresh style of your own, choose Orenstein's book.  I am returning this one because I have no use for it 
 I have to admit, I have forced myself to listen to Michael Weiner's abortion of a talkshow more than once.In a way it's almost humorous, until you stop to think that so many people in this country not only take this man seriously, they view him as a deep political thinker. He is not.He is an ignorant, homophobic, sexist, racist little subhuman troll. An insult to true, honest-to-God old-fashioned American conservatism. William F. Buckley Jr he ain't. What this is the rantings of a deeply psychologically disturbed individual. One would find more insightful comments at your state's mental hospital, or by a survey of several of your town's homeless population. I can't wait for the day when Savage, Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly AND their counterparts on the left Moore, Franken, Janeane Garafolo and the rest are off the air and languishing in the obscurity that they so deserve. Or even better, we could get NASA to get cracking on building the first solar lander, and have them put these windbags on it. The average IQ of the nation would increase, and perhaps we would then be able to listen to REAL political discourse, instead of a bunch of ignorant, partisan loudmouths with an agenda screaming at one another. 
 Mr. Ginzburg's "The Cheese and the Worms" is destined to be enormously successful among young, undisciplined students who lack the discernment or the inclination necessary to tell history from fantasy (as  several of the reviews above will attest.) Ginzburg, although an  accomplished researcher and a fine writer, has written a very murky and  extremely biased interpretation of Domenico Scandella's life. Ginzburg is  far too facile and quick to cite his own unsubstantiated assertions as  "proof" of his conclusions, and his slipshod thinking mars what  might otherwise have been a fine and valuable book 
 This book was nothing but painful to try and get through. Though I sometimes enjoy Jodi Picoult's writing, Picture Perfect was extremely far fetched and simply unbelievable.  I spent a lot of time rolling my eyes, shaking my head, thinking...come on, give me a break. I stopped the torture about 60% of the way through, giving up the hope that I had indeed wasted 10.46.   Pretentious, unbelievable, boring, pathetic story line...save yourself the money and the torture..pass this Jodi Picoult novel by 
 Dated, biased account of what happened at PARC and at Xerox headquarters. Very out of date, especially given PARC's foresight in terms of  distributed, connected computers. It seems like the authors decided to bash  Xerox even before they began their research. Save your money on this one. A  better bet is "Dealers of Lightning" by Michael Hiltzik. That one  points out what Xerox did wrong, and, oh, by the way, what they did right.  (For example, make a couple of billion dollars out of the Laser Print  industry.) The authors of this one just seemed to have it "in"  for Xerox. I wonder if they used a windows based PC or Mac to type the  original manuscript? Not without PARC, they wouldn't have 
 This book was too long and I just got tired of it all after awhile.  Where is it going?  What can it do for me?  Why am I reading this?  I just got so exhausted with it that I had to give up.  It's 400 pages after all -- 400!   Talk about fatigue 
 After being inspired by the movie, I was disappointed with the actual book, which is quite different from the movie.  It focuses a lot on the years before Chris became a father--including many (more than necessary) descriptions of his sexual exploits, drug use, etc...ultimately proving Chris to be less of a hero than was portrayed by Will Smith.  Didn't leave me with the heartwarming feeling that the movie did 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 I absolutely loved books 1 through 3. In fact, at one point, I thought they were better than Jordan's Wheel of Time. But I can't finish this book IV; I'm ending the adventure on page 376. If I was to summarize what has happened so far I don't think there would be a spoiler in the lot. Whilst something may happen in the remaining ~300 pages the burden of reading through to it is too onerous.   It has been a struggle to wade through the lengthy descriptions, the numerous characters and the lack of any real action. The appendix contains 65 pages of "who's who"; the book is a real alphabet soup of characters - many of whom add nothing to the plot. I simply could not keep up with the characters - those of you with a good memory may have a more enjoyable time with the book.  The book needs a proper editing to reduce the redundancy. There are repetitive references to Brienne being freakish and ugly, Cersei hating the Imp, etc. For redundancy I would have much preferred a little intro summarizing where book III left off (in fairness, there are some references to past intrigue peppered throughout Book IV).  Cersei's scheming is an enjoyable read but its disappointing that she and Tyrion (the Imp) will not be duking it out in this book. GRRM said he wants to "tell all the story for half the characters". If true, that implies we won't see Cersei and Tyrion together in the next book either. Pity. 
 I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please 
 Never mind's that it's pretty stupid - "John Tucker Must Die," like a lot of movies about high-schoolers, actually hates high school and just about everybody in it, and by extension, American kids; it's the kind of movie that, if parents caught an hour of it, would make them think less of their children for watching it, and to a fearsome extent, pretending to live it out. Early in the movie one character, a cheerleader, remarks about stealing her mother's estrogen pills: "Well, guys use steroids to build their pecs." That estrogen will do the same for the cheerleader's breasts is laughable, but considering the hot debate of steroid use among kids - considering kids have died or flown into abusive rages while using them - that could be most casual, sickening line of the year.   But it is what to expect from Hollywood screenwriters in their 30s who write exploitative trash for money then have the artistic gall to call it mild, girlie comedy - not unlike those fabulous "Laguna Beach" hacks who use insidious, and I mean insidious, editing techniques to create faux docudrama among teens with facial expressions and confused responses clearly mismatched, again and again in the sloppiest manner, to the previous line of dialogue. "JTMD" asks us to believe that the title character (Jesse Metcalf) simultaneously dates three women (Ashanti, Sophia Bush, Arielle Kebbel) without them knowing it, is able to afford repeated dinners at the nicest restaurant in town, owns a great car, stays in four-star hotels for high-school basketball road games, and my personal favorite, owns and drives a yacht. He and his brother have no parents to speak of.  Neither do the three girls, unless you count the cheerleader's mom reference. One of them (Bush) is an avowed 17-year-old vegan vixen, however. And when they discover they've all been dating the same guy in gym class, they get in a brawl and are not suspended, but sent to a 23-minute detention without a teacher.  Is this a satire, as "JTMD" bills itself? An edgy comedy? A smarter, cleverer film knows that teachers hand out discipline, in this post-Columbine world, for looking at each other funny, and that a brawl would constitute the lead story in the six o'clock news. A cleverer film has the girls chase not a superstar athlete, but, say head of the drama club. A cleverer film recognizes teen humor is mined not out of blase, ultra-hardened brat girls, but sweet, emotional, sunny girls. A cleverer film would know a dark comedy, if that's what "JTMD" intends to be, can't have cheesy lines and yachts sitting around to be driven.  Instead we have a fourth, "smart" girl (Brittany Snow) is introduced as the girls' grand, "Taming of the Shrew" plan to woo John and eventually stomp his heart. This angel, of course, begins to fall for John, who is not particularly charming or interesting or anything beyond possessive and very wealthy, which are, if we follow our MTV, two of the trinity (the last being sheer, drop-dead cuteness emanating from those soulful eyes said guys must have, preferably brown) that makes up male desirability. Director Betty Thomas pretends that humor are four very different idiots insulting each other over the cliques they belong to. Ashanti gets the shortest end of the stick, adhering fiercely to the idea that cheerleading, in an empowered, open society that has a foreign Hindu woman as CEO of Pepsi, represents the canopy of female of achievement. Go figure - you break the glass ceiling with a cheer pyramid!  We've been pounding this Earth for years now. Why do teens and young women still trail along, lapping it up? There is no real wit in the movie that you can't see from some third-rate comic being fed lines on a VH1 program, no style, no genuine attitude. It's all buried behind this driving notion of painting a portrait of a catty, young, rotten, unidealistic America most interested in getting tail, getting even and throwing s-uh-weet hoopty-rah parties. It is not immoral so much as it blank, a double zero signififying an unceasing period of meaningless motions to mimic, most involving self-debasement of young bodies. What fools Hollywood sees our children to be, wants them to be. What numb, donkey fools. If you need more proof, Jenny McCarthy has been cast as the voice of reason - and she's borderline believable.   Ya know, so much ugliness is spewed about "Islamofascists," these manaical, stoneaged fiends who apparently can't tell you the sky is blue, spending most of their time taping martyr videos, finding Mecca and concocting devices to destroy our way of life. Consider, though, that one of the more recognizable items in Muslim countries is the satellite dish . A year from now, this thing's on a movie channel, and well, whatever evidence terroritsts thought they needed to chart the American decline into shame, they've got it. Not because it's absent morals, but humanity - the better for the terrorists to treat us as the faceless collateral damage they believe us to be.  
 Well they flat out suck now. The heaviness is gone. Cheap attempt at airplay or more MTV time. They look like American Eagle posterboys. If you were a fan that saw a continual downward trend and thought the last disc was crap. At least you can now say, "I like some of their old stuff". This is weak, non-stoner, pop metal. THE BUSHMA 
 You'll be much better off with The Baby Book by Sears and Sears.  This book has some dangerous advice about breastfeeding that goes against the AAP's new guidelines.  And, Leman offers a cookie-cutter approach that is not good for all families.  The Baby Book is a fabulous investment by parents of eight, who also happen to be a pediatrician and lactation consultant/R.N.  Buy that book instead 
 The only song i wanted to hear is not on the cd. I hear its hidden what is the trick to finding it 
 I was at the library, wondering if rabbits made good pets, and I picked up this book. It was right beside dog training books, books about cats, etc. But, unfortunately, as I found out when I got home, this book is about raising rabbits to sell for meat. The last chapter is horrific- after going into detail about how to raise these beautiful creatures, the author goes about telling the reader how to destroy it, and which spices taste nice on its skin. No thanks. I just want a Mopsy 
 I bought this book because I expected it to be a long-awaited branching-out of Ms. de la Cruz's from teen chick-lit to something a bit more serious.  Being a bit of an outcast myself I expected to sympathize with the character of Schuyler van Alen.  However, while the main plotline of the story was just as shallow, if not more so, than The Au Pairs, the secondary prologue plotline was what truly disappointed me.    I am a writer.  I am not published, and I'm only eighteen, but what I do a lot of in my free time is write.  And when I'm not writing about made-up fantasy worlds, sometimes I actually have to do research about our own world for the book to make sense. Ms. de la Cruz, and her editors, seem to not care about this at all.  I realize that she grew up in the Phillippines and therefore the history of the Mayflower might not have been as ingrained into her childhood as it was into mine.  But a bit of internet research could have prevented her from making the painful errors she made in writing this book.  For example:   1. On page three, the first entry, the writer states: "it has been a difficult winter" as her opening comment.  If you will notice the date on the top of the page, it is November 21st.  November is not winter.  Nor, as the narrator later states, have the settlers even docked yet.  The difficult winter did not occur until the settlers had arrived in Plymouth.  2. About Plymouth.  They spelled it `Plimoth' at the time.  3. On page 56, the second entry, the narrator writes: "... joyful news-- the people of this new land have welcomed us with open arms and many gifts.  They brought us wild game, a large bird that could feed an army, a bunch of vegetables, and maize."  This is supposedly the 25th of November, 1620.  The Indians did not meet the Pilgrims until March 16th, 1621.  The first Thanksgiving, as de la Cruz alludes to, was not celebrated until August of that year.  The reason the Pilgrims suffered through their first winter was their isolation from other people, including the Indians.  The narrator also states: "...we are heartened by the sight of the verdant land, the vast virgin acres."  Other than the nauseatingly blatant and inept attempt at alliteration, I wonder exactly how `verdant' the `acres' could have looked in late November in Massachusetts.  Interesting how de la Cruz first calls November winter, and then suddenly it's spring!    4. On page 80-- diary entry three-- the narrator states: "Today Myles Standish took a team down the coast the Roanoke to bring medicine, food, and supplies to the settlers there.  It is a fortnight's sail, so they will be gone a good while."  This is the thirtieth of November.  Need I reiterate my previously made point about the Plymouth settlers' isolation?  They would have had no contact with Roanoke.  Furthermore, the Plymouth/Plimoth colonists did not have extra medicine, food or supplies, they barely had enough for themselves.   5. On pages 125 and 184, the last two diary entries, the narrator writes: "The men have been gone for days now, and still there is no word.  We are frightened.  They should have arrived there and returned by now, with news of the colony.  But all is silent," and "Alas!  Alas!  Everyone from Roanoke is disappeared.  Myles and the men found nothing of the colony," respectively.  These entries were for December 20th and 23rd, respectively.  Let's think about this, shall we?  Aside from the fact that the words "Alas!  Alas!" reek of something I might have written to show `emotion' in the third grade after reading too much historical fiction, the "journey to Roanoke" would take a fortnight, as stated in entry three.   That means a round trip would take two fortnights.  As in four weeks.  November 30th-December 20th isn't even three weeks.   The men should not have been back by then, nor should they have come back on December 23rd.  They should have come back on December 28th. As I said before, I am eighteen.  My elementary school teachers drilled the story of the pilgrims into us from a very young age.  I am surprised, after reading the reviews by everyone else on here, that no one else picked up on this very crucial fact. How do I catch things that published authors and paid editors do not?  Are the powers that be at Hyperion all exceptionally bad at American History, or have they let Ms. de la Cruz get away with shoddy writing and fact-checking simply because they know the success of her earlier Au Pairs books would lead to millions buying this book (followed by the continued dumbing-down of American teenagers)?  That they would let something so blatantly wrong onto bookshelves astounds me.  Most authors know to do research before writing-- in fact, most high schoolers do-- and this was a slap in all of our faces. I already wrote all of this in a letter to Hyperion asking them to revise or recall the book, but like the ostriches they are, they have done nothing to this effect. People!  Don't accept this sort of shoddily-written tripe!  Look at what I have to say and don't hesitate to follow me in petitioning Hyperion and Ms. de la Cruz 
 It's a tough read. It does not keep my interest. I will finish it because I started it, but it is one I could definitely put down 
 What the ----.  "A tale of revenge"?  Why does everyone in their review say that?  B/c it's written on the box cover??  This is an interesting and compelling movie, but w/ a very odd, abrupt ending that leaves you hitting the "REWIND" button and saying, "what a minute, is it OVER??  Did I miss something??"  Afte watching this, I scoured the internet, Wikipeida, and Amazon...still no reviewer seems able to say what was meant by the ending of this film.  My takeaway on it -- she is going to hang, and die (go to heaven);  he is going to stay on Earth..but maybe when they meet again (heaven), they can get married.  ??  ????  How come no one else can come up w/ a definitive meaning to the end of this film?  Subtlety is great, but not if it's so damn ambiguous that NOBODY in the universe seems to be able to define or explain what this film was all about.  It was NOT about revenge.  Maybe it was about love and obsession and sadness and the silliness of despair.   Sorry, can't really recommend this one! 
 I started this book the same way I started almost every Marquez book in the past - expecting to be mesmerized and taken away for a while from my world to one of the magical-real worlds of Marquez. The first few tens of pages of this book took off the way those in any other Marquez book do: slowly, but promisingly creating a solid loom to weave a tale on. And then the next tens of pages continued in the same vein, as did the next few chapters, and so on and so forth.   Actually, to be fair, at least a part of the problem could be with my expectations. I was expecting another stunning piece of writing, even if it was a recount of reality. But then, how many readers of Marquez would hold that against me and expect differently of him? After all, his books have been as much about his writing style as they have been about his vivid imagination, haven't they? So that's primarily what I felt let down about in this book - the book just fails to grip. Marquez's writing seems weak like never before (except for the odd brilliant phrase here and there), and there aren't enough interesting tales to tell anyway. The book never moves beyond the context-setting; there is almost no dramatic arc, and; there is hardly any climatic resolution.   To summarize quickly then, I would recommend this book to very die-hard Marquez fans only. The only real value of this book lies in helping Marquez's readers undestand how he came to be the writer he did. If you are prepared to go through 500 pages of tedium for that, go for it. 
 The book was interesting to me because the author speaks about life in the Army. Some soldiers got good and bad experience  during their time. The book makes comments about three diferent soldiers 
 I admire anybody who can put a comic together, although I'm not an avid comics reader (SIN CITY remains my favorite series). That said, recent NPR, boing-boing and Entertainment Weekly reviews have raved about this sereis, prompting me to look into it. Alas, more than halfway thru book one I am at a loss to understand the glittering praise that has been heaped on this work. The premise is intriguing (if a bit far fetched), but the writing is awful. Infantile gimmicks and coincidences abound, and horrible dialog assaults your eyes and insults your intelligence in every panel. The drawnig is generic and un-memorable, but it isn't as bad as the writing. Maybe it gets way better later, but my experience is that the odds are against it. If this is an exceptional contemporary comic, lord protect us from the rest of the lot 
 Richard is a funny guy. He never can overcome his SCIENTISM and naturalistic reductionism. I wish I could talk to him to help him out (if I were doctor). He needs (1) therapy and (2) to THINK a little more... Dawkins like to use straw-man arguments and does NOT know anything about Christian Theology. I'm truly Sorry for him when he embarases himself with poor representation of something he know nothing about (when talks about religious matters, or even science).  I have also read his article "Science is not a religion" (which is not very good article), and apparently FOR HIM science is a religion...  Usually religious experience involve (a) awareness of the Transcendent and (b) total commitment to It. Dawkins' Transcendant is "THE GREAT SCIENTISM". :D and of course he is commited to it. Not the science, but scientism... Otherwise why would he go around with his naturalistic dogmatism?  
   While it's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words, communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound, thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination. Deconstructionism, by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs, dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is, of course, inhabited by people who read and people who write. This is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical: It rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo-mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone 
 MAn, what a boring book! Ok, anyone inhis right frame of mind by now has already undertood that Bush has been practicing foul play all aorund in his war decisions. Everybody by now knows that the reasons given to go to Iraq were fake, a total lie. But Barber uses two hundred pages to sing a single song: opreventive democracy is better than preventive war. Sure. But he uses almost 300 hundred pages of the same arguments, making this a lame reading 
 Who better to write a book about morons than Flynn?  An abyssmally miserable book with so little substance I was surprised it didn't float out of my hands.  It's a great resource for those looking for a plethora of examples of pitifully poor logic; Two wrongs don't make a right, non-sequiturs galore, red herrings - they're all there.  It seems apparent the goal was to scoop up the easy money from the thin thinkers in our world.  It certainly wasn't to write a scholarly treatise where the reader came away enlightened in the slightest way.  I guess I have fallen into the category of "moron" by spending money on it and worse yet, reading it to completion.  I'm embarrassed.  Flynn should be too 
 Ahh, so the illustrious Robert Jordan has graced us with a prequel.  Great.  More Wheel of Time to digest.  So how was it?  Honestly, it wasn't that bad of a book.  Much shorter than his usual efforts, the pace moved along faster than his later WOT installments (for the most part), and some interesting stuff in there about the end of the Aiel War, Lan's part in that conflict, and his eventual meeting with Moraine.  Sadly, those storylines mentioned above occupy only the beggining and ending of the novel.  Pretty much the entire middle is filled with the same dredging, monotonous crap that ruined books 8-11: namely, women bitching at each other.  I clung to the hope that the female characters in the prequel would not be subject to the same plague of whiny, insecure, petty bickering than has infected every single woman in the later WOT books.  I was violently disabused of that notion.  Young Morainne and Suian are sad dissapointments.  They are not the young and inexperienced, yet determined and formidable women you would expect.  They are carbon copies of Elayne and Egwene - stupid, jealous, unbelievably fickle characters that make you want to scream.  And a good 1/2 of the novel regards their day to day activities in the Tower: fetching tea, worrying about the Mistress of Novices, staging sorority girl pranks, and all that other crap we've already been through with Egwene, Nyneave, and Elayne!  Get to the point!  Did the book really need to be written?  No, especially with the end of the actual series looming, and so many loose threads still to tie up.  All in all New Spring was not terrible, but I really wish RJ would focus his effort on producing a few good books to wrap up Wheel of Time.  Then maybe he can start screwing around with prequels - if anyone is still interested at that point, and the way it's going now, I would say very few would. Count me out 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 I'm a Tami Hoag fan, but this book was weak at best.  The plot was predictable; the characters stereotypical and 2 dimensional.  The reparte between the characters was overly witty and contrived.  Hoag is definitely capable of a more intricate plot and better writing.  
 The first time I used these push-up bars the flimsy plastic they're made out of cracked in three different places.  Perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely, but I'm not going to risk an injury finding out.  In the trash they go... I suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing 
 I would just like to add my note of agreement with the reviews of Michael A. Gatto and Bill Marsano and add one additional rather major error in "Stolen Figs"; on page 92, "After Hannibal came the Longobards, the Byzantines, and, in the middle of the sixth century, the Normans,...". How's that for turning history on its head? And he's only about five centuries off with the Normans. Conclusion? A complete waste of time 
 I'm not sure Byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel.  I read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism, but this tome was virtually unbearable once I hit about the halfway point.  The first half was somewhat interesting and I had high hopes.  But as the book quote-unquote progressed, there just was more and more nothin'.  Endless, lengthy quotations and, frankly, boring observations.  I'm not sure I have anything of value to comment on, specifically, but I would like to forewarn readers:  this is one of the most trying, pretentious, uninteresting books I have ever read, and I think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers.  It could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then.  Yuck 
 It seems that Landes' idea of scholarship is forming a theory first and THEN find all the evidence/stories that support that theory and ignore the rest. So, medieval Europe was actually a crucible of ideas, compared to the rest of the world, because of the invention of the eyeglasses and the clock. And due to utilizing animal power, Europe didn't need as many people and hence had lower population density. This may be true, except Landes hasn't given out any evidence. One can easily counter argue that it had less people because of its lower productivity could support less people. This is true of many of the other assertions in the book.  Bottom line: biased writer with shoddy scholarship. If you want a good euro-centric read, I recommend The Rise of the West instead. McNeill at least is knowledgeable and insightful within his area of expertise. 
 Magical Child does have its moments but these are few and far between.  One has to wade through overwrought hyperbole and constant repetition to get at the few insights Mr. Pearce does have.  His comments on childbirth  are poignant and do illustrate just how far we have allowed technology and  modern medical practice to distort what should be a joyous and natural  process.   This book is laced with annoying terminology and proffers claims  of clairvoyant capabilities that would shame a supermarket tabloid.  Had  the author concentrated more on child development and less on developing a  polemic, a more insightful and useful book would have been the resul 
 Lots of little anecdotes about Rebecca Cole, but as an inspiration for container gardening, this book is a bomb. If you like cute, this might be your cup of tea, but if you want to create a garden that's something  special, this book won't help. Lots of marigolds and petunias in cast-off  containers, but nothing new or noteworthy in the plant department. Try  Gardening without a Garden by Gay Search or 50 Recipes for Container  Gardens by Richard Bird 
 As a parent of a child with Tourette's, I feel I must warn anyone trying to learn about TS to ABSOLUTELY NOT buy this horrifying book.  It is full of completely outdated and flat out wrong information that has long since been dismissed by current clinical studies.  Please skip it and go read Brad Cohen's boo 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 It has nothing but pre-published photos we have all seen before in magazines. The tats aren't even shown. They talk about how Angelina has a lot of them but they don't even list them all. Not made for the true tattoo enthusist. A coffee table book at best. It describes their crazy childhoods more than the tats 
 hi just to let you guys know that i found a lot of your books are more expensive than my damn book store at my school for some reason for example this book managerial accounting for Mr Garrison is 87.00 at my school book store but at your sale it is more than a hundred as a used one can some body fix this stuff or you guys going to let a thrifty customer like me run a way from your web site  
 As the old saying goes, Tim O'Brien has nothing to say, but he says it very well.   The setting is cliche'ed - the 30 year reunion of the Class of '69 full of stock characters left over from The Big Chill - but the author keeps the pace moving nicely with chapters alternating between the events of the reunion and flashbacks to the past.   The characters have a paint-by-numbers feel to them, however. During the reunion, many of them make major changes in their lives, but you know that they are just making the same mistakes that the earlier chapters led them through. The characters demonstrate no growth, no reexamination of their lives, no new insights. The result is a flat and depressing regurgitation of successful, but empty lives.  Maybe that is the point of the book: that the shallow Baby Boomers have no capacity for change, that they will wallow in their materialism full of good intentions and bad actions until the day they die.   Whether that is the theme of the book or a fault in its author, it makes for a depressing read 
 This bra was well made, fabric very soft but the sizes were way off. Cup is cut to big, it would be difficult to wear a scoop, or v neck top , as the cup covers to much of chest area. Would not buy this brand again or style again, even for $7 each 
 This is the shortest book I failed to finish. I'm sorry, but for a short novel, it was just got too wordy and touchy-feely for me. I loved Emperor of the Air, a collection of short stories in which feelings and places were described succintly. And the events happened at a quicker pace. But in Blue River, Canin stretches out all his descriptions of places, of main character's resentments, disappointments, fears, and memories. It really feels tedious to read and halfway through it, I just had to give up 
 This book is just too long. If it were condensed to sub-100 pages it might be worthwhile as it contains some interesting ideas. Unfortunately most of the examples begin with "Cisco decided to..", "At Cisco we..., "The Cisco method of..." ......you get the idea. The authors cite "Good to Great" which is a real contrast, because the Collins team examines a wide variety of companies and industries rather than simply concentrating on Cisco. The book is also packed with graphics that -- let's face it folks -- are simply meaningless. I do not understand the reason for the other glowing reviews. Mediocre "at best" 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 This has been a nightmare. When I received the chair I couldn't wait to put it together. However the holes for the screws were too big and therefore I was unable to secure the pieces. I called and asked if the  the right size screws could be sent. I was told that there were no provisions for that, but they would be happy to send me another one.   (I could return the faulty one in that box.) Very nice I thought. Well I got the second one. THE SCREWS ARE TOO SMALL FOR THE HOLES! Now I am stuck with chair parts all over the house and no chair to sit on! I don't recommend this item 
 Professor Solove comments about me on page 147 are out and out lies. Search  washingtonpost.com news archives for "john and holt and and gsa" for the true story. John Emory Holt  
 This book is nothing but a load of propaganda and quotes from a bible written solely by men.  This is not the type of book for an independent, freethinking woman.  This is a great book for a mindless person looking for inspiration on how to be married to a man and give him control over you.  I would suggest reading Sue Monk Kidd's, Dance of the Dissident Daughter.  It will give you far more insight on how being an empowered woman can enhance all parts of your life, including being a wife. 
 I really enjoyed this book. I am a Counsellor and a Coach and have already had several opportunities to relay some of the information in it to clients of mine who in turn have found it concrete and easy to understand. There is a very good section on children that all parents would do well to read 
 I just love how everyone assumes that teenage girls are always "pressured" into sex, because *of course* young women are completely and utterly devoid of sex drives and are totally unable to make decisions for themselves. I also love how the "misinformation" regarding contraception [that is actually *not* in our schools due to the best efforts of our Federal Government and the religious right] is persuading "sweet girls" to have sex. Excuse me, but the whole virgin/... dichotomy has got to go. I agree that if you're under 18 you probably should be focusing on school instead of sex, and I am aware that way too many girls *are* pressured into sex, but for god's sake, stop acting as if we don't have spines 
 I read all 12 of these things. Armageddon has it's moments but as with most of this series is sorely lacking. Nicolae and Leon are pretty lame as the incarnation of evil.. Nicolae acts more like a spoiled 11 yr old with the world's arsenal then the antichrist.  And Leon (was a buffoon and lacky) rather then "the False Prophet")   People either love or hate this series.. I for one do buy into the Dogma the series teaches. It is much different then the theology and spiritual beliefs I hold dear. 
 This is a very comprehensive, easy to understand manual on how to get the most from a router. I recommend it to anyone wanting hints on extending the applications possible from their router 
 now mabye this is not fair because i do not usually like realistic books but this book was boring. I hade to read this book for school and I was bored. It's about a young boy named Fu growing up and having a hard life in  China. I would not recomend this book unless really like realistic books  and ones that are slow. Did I mention the chapters were long 
 I want this guy to succeed so badly, yet he just couldn't pull it off.   His voice has a great sound to it, pleasant to the ears, yet his interpretation was just not there. His  phrasing was very lazy and boring most times. It seemed like he didn't know where to start the next word. And he also sounded out of breath. He sounded so out of breath that I started gasping for air...I had to stop listening.  To add to that, John's vibrato sounded washed out and faded in places where it needed to be stronger.  I truly hope with age and experience he improves. There's no reason why he should not. He's not in the catagory of a Buble' or Connick Jr. yet. 
 I had to read this book in english class this year and it was absolutely horrid. The jokes weren't funny and the story was just stupid. Also, if you actually like the book, don't buy this edition because it falls apart. The book is about the battle of the sexes and it's stupid, pointless and boring. On top of it, you'll be really confused at times because of the old english. It's not a fun read more like a frustrating read. This is definitely one of my least favorite books of all time. 
 trust me, this book(let) is really bad. Nothing Nothing, it contains Nothing!   I guess some top bankers just write whatever off their minds during lunchtime and put into this book(let) for sale.   there is no way people would rank it 4-5 stars on a sane mind.   buy it and you will regret 
 I read this book, and I must say, it seems that the only thing she likes is Pantene, and other like products. On every other page there is a reference to a product, but how Pantene is better. Are you kidding me!!!! Yuck! I think she seriously got paid off on this one. Cover to cover advertisements for a damaging horrrible product 
 The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.    Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.    Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.    And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.    Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".  By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.    This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.  
 Unfortunately, I haven't read the book, but this page seems to be a breeding ground for posers. 
 This book is appalling. It is disempowering to women, providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births (with no reference to back it up), and generally gives a "don't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you" attitude--even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby.   In spite of what this book says, there are things you can do to minimize tearing (and episiotomies don't heal better than tears, in spite of what the book says), things you can do to improve your chances of a healthy baby without a cesarean or other medical interventions, and so on. Of course there are times these things are needed, but not nearly so often as the book suggests, and it's not nearly so random. It continually cites opinions as facts, without any evidence base.  There are much, much better books out there than this one. Don't subject yourself to the needless anxiety of this book 
 I usually enjoy James Pattersons' Alex Cross stories. I am not a die-hard fan, but I have always found myself entertained when reading most of the previous novels. But London Bridges hit rock bottom almost from the very beginning.  The story is made from the same formula the past 3-4 Cross-stories has been, and you can almost guess what will happen in the super-short chapters.  First we are inside the mind of one or more of the villains while they commit some gruesome crime, and the plotline is laid out. Then Dr Cross enters the stage, usually semi-depressed over something in his private life, a condition not made any better by the crime he is called in to solve, again usually with a bunch of colleagues, who can be detectives or federal agents, depending on where you are in the series. This time he is upset because of his youngest son, who lives with his mother in Seattle, a long way from Washington DC, where Cross resides with his older kids and his grandmother. Cross is also upset because he has to break up a date with his girlfriend Jamilla, a detective living in San Francisco, in order to get to the scene of this novels 'basic' crime.  This time the villain The Wolf has blown a trailerpark community off the face of the earth, and threatens to do the same to some of the world's major cities, if he is not paid a gazillion dollars and if some political prisoners are not set free. A deadline is given, the clock is ticking and Cross travels from America to Europe and back again and then to Europe and then to USA again within a week or so, in order to catch The Wolf and his fellow thugs, each of the thugs acting out their piece of The Wolf's big puzzle and way to world dominion.  The last 10 pages are utterly confusing, there is no tail nor head, the story seems to be all over the place, and at last you really could not care less if Cross and his whole family will actually survive the ordeals.  This book is not recommend for anyone excpet die hard Patterson/Cross fans. It does not live up to the expectations, but if Patterson can write 5-6 novels a year, then maybe there is an explanation for this book's lacking in quality 
 Disappointing.  Many pictures are dark and/or fuzzy.  I find that hard to distinguish features of different hawks 
  I find it fascinating how often members of both sides of the evolution-creation argument accuse each other of some kind of questionable practice - whilst doing exactly the same thing themselves.  The credibility of this book can be gauged right from the start of the first chapter - by the arguments presented by an evolutionist who is pulling exactly the kind of stunts that evolutionists most hate (and quite reasonably so) when such actions are being carried out by creationists.  First the author uses a passage from the work of Henry Morris as though it faithfully represented the views of ALL those who prefer a creationist explanation of the origins of mankind.  Secondly the author fails to distinguish between "fundamentalist", "creationist" and "literalist", drawing the assumption, for example, that all fundamentalists are literalists as far as interpreting the contents of the Bible is concerned. This is categorically NOT true - as illustrated all the way back in 1925 when William Jennings Bryan (a renowned fundamentalist but NOT a literalist) explained, in the course of the trial of John Scopes, that he believed in the literal truth of the Bible, but ONLY insofar as it was meant to be taken literally.  Next the author makes an unjustified leap - from saying that evolutionism (from a creationist viewpoint) "may be because of the Devil" (page 1) to the extremist claim that "scientific creationism" is seen by its adherents as "a battle between Good and Evil" and that "either you are for God, or on the side of the Devil" (page 2).  So, in the space of just about one full page of text, the author selected to "open the batting" has indulged in the three cardinal sins so often ascribed to creationists:   - Quote mining  - Misuse of technical terms  - Building straw men as a basis for repudiating the case made by the people you are criticising.  Please note, I am not for one moment denying that "some" creationists may be in complete agreement with Dr. Morris' views; "some" creationists definitely do indulge in quote mining; "some" creationists do misuse (deliberately or through ignorance) technical terms and definitions relating to evolution; and "some" creationists definitely do base their arguments on "straw men" because they are so much easier to demolish than confronting the "facts".  But NOT all of them. Contrary to the implication made by this author, and throughout most of the book, creationists are a diverse lot and definitely not a neatly self-contained, homogenous group which can be written off with a few supercilious side swipes. Nor is it true that ONLY "scientific creationists" (or any other religion-oriented groups/individuals) have criticisms of the supposedly "scientific" evidence used to support evolutionist claims.  (See, for example, "Shattering the Myths of Darwinism", by Richard Milton, a science journalist and evolutionist with NO religious affiliations.)  In a nutshell, "Scientists Confronting Creationism" is preaching strictly to the "converted" whilst adding little or nothing to a genuinely informed and useful debate.  
 On page 11 of this book, the authors provide a list of what they think are the unifying themes of neoconservatism.  "[One theme of neoconservatism is a] belief deriving from religious conviction that the human condition is defined as a choice between good and evil and that the true measure of political character is to be found in the willingness of the former (themselves) to confront the latter. ... [Neoconservatives] analyze international issues in black and white, absolute moral categories. They are fortified by a conviction that they alone hold the moral high ground and that disagreement is tantamount to defeatism. ... They disdain country-specific, realist, and pragmatic analysis."  In order to evaluate this passage, consider the following fundamental question: Do there exist methods for determining whether one form of political organization is superior to another?  This same question can be posed in the economic sphere: Do there exist methods for determining whether one form of economic organization is superior to another. In fact, such methods are applied in the economic sphere all the time. For example, the IMF may undertake to determine whether a nation's financial system is sound or needs reforming. Implicit in the IMF's actions are the assumptions that 1.) some forms/features/characteristics of economic organization are, in fact, preferable to others and 2.) the IMF has a methodology for distinguishing between desirable and undesirable features of economic systems. This should not be surprising. After all, businesses like Moody's and Standard and Poors make determinations about the financial soundness of nations and multi-national corporations all the time.  Two more points can be made. First, whatever the basis for the determinations made by institutions like the IMF and the ratings agencies, it is safe to say these determinations are not founded on "religious conviction." (I personally am both a neocon and an atheist.) Secondly, once these institutions have made their determinations, they often seek to use some form of coercion, or conditionality, to force nations with undesirable economic characteristics to modify those characteristics. For example, the IMF may make tranches of funding conditional on certain reforms being implemented in a timely fashion.  We may conclude, therefore: 1.) there do exist methodologies for determining whether one form of economic organization is superior to another; 2.) these methodologies are applied on a regular basis; 3.) these methods are not based on "religious convictions," and; 4.) it is not unnatural for multi-national agencies to seek to coerce nations into reforming economic organizations that display undesirable economic characteristics.  And yet, if all of these conclusions are true of economic systems, it is not surprising that they should also be true of political systems: 1.) we should not be surprised to find methodologies for determining whether one form of political organization (or a kind of political organization with certain characteristics) is superior to another; 2.) we should not be surprised if these methodologies are applied on a regular basis; 3.) there is no reason to think that the basis for these methodologies is to be found in "religious convictions," and; 4.) it would not be unnatural for multi-national agencies to seek to coerce nations into reforming undesirable political systems.  One may reply to point 4.): "Yes, such actions are appropriate for multi-national agencies, but not for a single nation operating unilaterally. Also, suasion should be used instead of coercion." To which I would reply: "But, what if the multi-national agencies have failed to do their job? Also, suasion and coercion are two points on a continuity. War is merely the continuation of policy by other means."  So, there are certain points that are agreed on (or should be agreed on) by all and some points on which there are disagreements. The points that should be agreed on are: 1.) certain forms of political organization are, in fact, preferable to others and 2.) these preferable forms can be identified and should be encouraged. The points that are not agreed on are: 1.) Who should do the encouraging of nations to change their political forms? and 2.) How should this encouraging be done? As for the points that are not agreed on, I think the disagreements are arrived at in good faith: there are arguments to be made on both sides. But, certainly the Bush administration can make a very strong case that the United Nations has failed to perform its duties in encouraging political reform throughout the world and that war is a proper instrumentality of coercion to effect regime change under certain extreme circumstances.  Let us return now to the passage quoted from the book. First of all, we can see that the idea that methodologies for distinguishing between good and bad political or economic organizations must derive from "religious convictions" is a canard. Secondly, we can see that it is not in the least unusual for agencies to use such methodologies to try to make determinations as to whether particular organizations are good or bad -- to assign "value judgments," in other words. As for the question about how "the character of a politician" should be defined, we can see that, well, yes, the character of a politician, just like the character of, say, an accountant, is, in fact, measured by a willingness to distinguish between good and bad and to oppose the bad. For example, the character of an auditor is determined every day by his willingness to apply a methodology for distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable accounting practices and to refuse to sign off on unacceptable ones. We have seen over the last several years what happens to financial markets if this "true measure of character" is lacking. It would be absurd to argue that an auditor who is applying his methodology should be criticized because he is "analyzing issues in black and white, absolute moral categories." The real problem starts when the auditor stops analyzing issues in black and white and begins to blur the picture or accepts the CFO's argument that the company ought to be allowed to present financial information in a "company-specific, realist, and pragmatic" way.  In other words, if the main accusation against neocons is that they seek to apply a methodology to distinguish between good and bad political systems and then stubbornly promote good political systems and oppose bad political systems, then, most neocons, I believe, would probably say that they were guilty as charged. For, compromise in the face of evil is worse than defeatism. It is, in fact, (here is that awful word again that post-modernism and relativism have such a difficult time with) immoral 
 Terribly weak compared to her other work 
 I have read and enjoyed James Patterson in the past, but can honestly say that this will be the last Patterson book I will read.  I was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability.  The book had no depth, and the story suffered for it.  As I read the book I got the impression that Mr. Patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible, and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting.  I did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable.  
 Kramer seems to think that we have strayed from the path of letting the People decide constitutional issues. There are significant reasons why Madison and others thought that would be a problem. Freedom of speech, for example, is something that the majority of voters or their representatives in congress would do away with in an instant if it weren't for the Supreme Court. Freedom of speech is fine until some group like the communists or the nazi party tries to exercise it, then legislators try to make laws saying they can't. In our constitution it is imperative to have a less political branch deciding these issues. Yes, the Supremes make unpopular decisions sometimes, but that is their job. Allowing the boneheads in congress to decide important constitutional issues would be folly. They would play to the lowest common denominator and have us giving away our rights in the name of God or security or morality. The Constitution has a way for the people to check the Supreme Court. We can impeach them or amend the constitution. Kramer's book looks back on the golden age in 1800 when we voted out a political party because of the unconstitutional laws they passed. Does he deny the havoc some poorly thought out laws could wreak in 21st century America? We don't have time to allow people to take away American's rights with the idea we might get them back in the next election 
 this band really effing sucks live... they had this huge, metal skull with batwings that FLAPPED.. and that alone made me watch to punch myself in the face for being there 
 I'm writing this reveiw on the company, Discount Ramps, rather than the ramps themselves. They charged my credit card immediately upon ordering, then 6 weeks later when I inquired about where these ramps were, they told me the manufacturer hadn't received the metal to build them yet, and the build time is 4-6 weeks. Just be careful, people 
 I did not finish the book (I got about 70% of the way through before I realized I could not bear to read one more page).  Maybe the remaining part of the book would have been better, but I doubt it.  This is the first time I can ever remember not even having even the slightest interesting in finishing a book.  The characters were flat and plot went nowhere.  Please - there are million of books out there.  Spare yourself, and find something else to read. Anything. 
 The Civ name has been tarnished.  Analogously, one thing I have been learning is that just because Sid Meier's name is on a product, it doesn't mean the product is good.  In the case of CivCity: Rome, unfortunately, it doesn't just come in at "modestly good" - it comes in at "dismally poor."  I've tried hard not to let this influence my beliefs about Civilization in general, but after Civ4 came out, I am starting to believe that Firaxis Games and Sid Meier are on their way out.  And now this...  I regret to inform that the great Civ titles were made a long time ago.  The offerings of today have a simple pattern: the production was rushed and the title came out with major bugs; the games add unnecessary features designed to justify the overall cost; and the consumers are often abused with ridiculous expansion packs containing features that should OBVIOUSLY have been included in the original release - they take advantage of our love for the franchise.  This pattern is so evident that the whole Sid Meier and Civ franchise is degenerating.  It almost seems, especially with the release of CivCity: Rome, that we are once again expected to simply drop cash for new products based on our love for the old.  But the developers are not living up to our expectations for producing great games!  Stay away from CivCity: Rome.  Besides the obvious blunders associated with all the bugs, you will see that even the best patch cannot make the graphics look good, the narration and sound effects better, or the interface to work properly.  The game is a dismal failure, and I am sorry to report that.  It seems like Firefly Studios had an idea and got the license from Firaxis, but they just cheesed it.  Watching what Maxis (The Sims and SimCity franchises) and Firaxis (Civilization franchise) are doing to their most loyal fans is like watching your dad get drunk 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 of all the billboard cds, this box set of 85-89 does not contain enough of the top hits of this period. most of the songs are of the flip side vintage. the grouping and selection of songs surely does not reflect the  top hits of 1985-89.a far cry from the best of billboards efforts on  previous years. for myself, a disappointment 
 ... until two thirds of the way through it limps on withouit a credible resolution and turns in to a cross between Star Trek, Dead Ringers and The Invisible Man. With a better 3rd act this could have been great. The guy can write 
 At a time when fine music is fighting for its life, Haroncourt delivers this. The sound is crystalline. Every voice is heard. The performance is dead, dead, dead. For the good of music, Harononcourt should remove the key that winds his clockwork heart and throw it away. This is the most lifeless performance of the Mozart Requiem on disk. Many more like this and classical music will be dead--it can take only so many defeats 
 My sister got this CD, and at first I didn't care. Until I heard the Beatles covers. I was absolutely horrified at what they did to those classic songs. The people who make these are the spawn of idiocy.  If those kids ruin another great song I'll hunt them down and throttle them in their sleep 
  Wanting something to read on vacation, I hurriedly grabbed the Vintage paperback edition from a dusty shelf in the back of my home office.  The book had belonged to my stepson many years ago. As I thumbed through the pages, it began to fall apart.   I do not recall having to read The Sound and the Fury in college, but I knew it was famous.  Other than that, I came to the book with an open mind but expecting excellence.  To that end, I was sorely disappointed, despite some fine passages, but even those often contained unclear elements.     From the start the story came across as gibberish.  Time jumped around, and characters appeared with little or no introduction.  Gradually a sense of story began to sink in, but by then, what might have been significant in the earlier pages was already lost to me.  I wondered what connection the title had to the story.  I struggled through the entire book, finding later sections to be more coherent, particularly the last, but I was unable to gain a full appreciation of the story.  And I wasn't about to reread the book repeatedly to obtain it.   There seems to be no effort at word economy, particularly in dialogue.  There are endless rambling paragraphs and only four "chapters" for the 400 pages of text.   Worst of all, there is inadequate exposition throughout the book.  There is no introduction telling the reader how the book is constructed, most notably, that it begins with an account by an idiot.  The idea of having a family's story related by several  members if fine, so is writing in stream of conscious, but adequate exposition is needed to orient the reader.     Frustrated during the reading, I thumbed through it and discovered the appendix which described the Compson family.  Most of this material should have been presented early in the book, but even that would not have provided adequate exposition.  After reading the book, I learned that the appendix was added some time after the first edition to help the reader.  That should be a big hint that the book is lacking in exposition.  I believe that good exposition is the responsibility of a writer.   This book is more of a puzzle than a story, and the latter is sacrificed for the former.  The author does not lead you through the story; he throws you into it.  For those who marvel at the literary value of this book, I say, "The emperor has no clothes. 
 Not particularly interesting or funny. None of the ridiculous turns of language of a Dave Barry column, no elder-statesman crabbiness like Andy Rooney's. Just routine bitching about airlines, office supplies, and so on. Save it for "A Walk in the Woods" or "A Short History of Nearly Everything 
 I bought this thinking it would work on public restrooms larger toilets for my toddler and it DOESN'T FIT AT ALL! if you are using just for home-sized potties it is fine except it heaves a little in the center but don't get it for travel as it doesn't work for that 
 This book is an utterly corrupt, crackpot method of lying to others in order to manipulate them, to live under a constant cloud of suspicion, and to essentially ruin your personal relationships.  Shall I give you an example?  From page 122:  "You and a friend are deciding on what movie to see.  You suggest 'Lost In Paradise', but your friend, who doesn't want to see this, offers as evidence a coworker who has already seen it and didn't like it.  you then say 'Oh, well, if no one in your office liked it, I guess it's probably no good.'  If she lets it go at that - not correcting you - then you know she LIED INITIALLY" (emphasis mine).  Excuse me?  What kind of special social retard do you have to be to 'know' your friend is a LIAR because she doesn't want to see a movie?  A little earlier, a technique called "Insert a False Fact" shows up.  INSERT A FALSE FACT?  Isn't that known as LYING?  And this in the context of a party, no less... hoo boy... start lying to everyone at a party because you suspect people of being liars - you're gonna wind up friendless pretty quick.  If you just tell the truth, you'll be amazed at the nice people you meet - who needs a book which rationalizes lying and manipulation?  Trust me, if you have a moral compass, you don't need this rag 
 As owner of Every single Chill/Lounge music CD I am aware of, this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time. Chillout 2001 thru Chillout 8 was very good in comparison. This CD is not a complete disaster, however, I could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating. Quite a few 4/5 star songs however, lots of 2-3 star songs. Some of the better songs were repeated on older Chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs.   I think the people that rated this 4 or 5 stars don't own a lot of lounge/chill and are probably a lot easier to please. I'm very dissapointed. Maybe this 'genre' is all dried up! :) Oh well...   I highly recomend any of the CDs in this set before this one. In fact, Chillout sessions 7 was SUPERB!!!  
 Although claiming to be a study of human-animal relationships, this book  offers an endless recital of man's inhumanity to man, to support the book's  theme that man's history with animals has been even worse. Very poorly  thought out and extremely long-winded, this book reads like an overblown  Usenet message--"those other people are all so horrible, but we animal  lovers are OK, aren't we?" Oddly, Serpell seems so rooted in the very  "human supremacist" philosophy that he rails against, that he  ends up reinforcing that very philosophy. Not enlightening at all; I feel  like a pall has been cast over my relationships with both people and  animals. You would learn far more by taking the money and time you might  waste on this book, and spending them on your own dog or cat or whatever  animal you please 
 I was excited to order this book, but found myself very disappointed after opening it. I skimmed through it maybe twice and have had no desire to look at it since. The format of the book is poor (in my opinion), most of the activities are corny and anything but creative, and everything about the book seems outdated. There is no color, pictures, or examples on any of the pages. The majority of the activities are generic and lacking in creativity. I have not used one activity from the book yet. I still can't figure out how they managed to fill so many pages with such bland theme activities 
 As a die-hard fan of Lenny who was born after his death, I must warn those that in this he strictly just goes over his court problems and doesn't do routines or bits 
 This is the worst book ever written. im serious. It does not make sense, it is really boring. Nothing happens, there is so much unneccesary writting. The author could have written the same information on just 100 pages. Do not buy this book. you will regret it . I repeat, you will regret it. Do not waste your money this book. Please look at other books instead. The author has written the book in a really stupid way. like right at the beggining, the protagonist recieves a grave letter from johhannesburg. Then his wike asks him what they should do about it. Then the protagonist responds DO ABOUT WHAT? then his wife says the letter of course. When I read this, I thought, Damn this book sucks! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!! 
 The book is a decent primer and is certainly more readable than Robert's original book.  Of course the original and all of its editions remain an example of very incomprehensible and convoluted language even for its era.  However, I have to handle large meetings of very strong-willed, intelligent people, so I found the "Plain English" book not very useful. I need to know the details and complexities of handling important meetings so that I make the right decisions.  I will stick with the more sophisticated texts 
 No lid!!!  Rather spend the money on a brand that thinks before selling 1/2 of a replacement piece 
 Well, I heard that the gun was LOUD!I don't think the preformence would be that great because the Double-Shot get jammed a lot and the bullets f#%@ up. I think BuzzBee has good guns though.Nerf has better darts so you can cut them so they'll fit.Overall I think it will be OK."IMPORTANT NOTE!" I DO NOT     HAVE THIS GUN.I AM RATING BY MY RESEARCH!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I guess I was expecting better writing from Nin. I have heard so many good things about her writing and I have read a few books by one of her "good friends", Henry Miller, that I decided to pick up Delta of Venus and was a bit disappointed. In the introduction Anais Nin describes the conditions under which she wrote much of what is contained in this book. Some wealthy "collector" had commissioned erotica at the rate of $1/page and he was not interested in anything but the physical act of sex. Well, Nin delivered. Much of the content is the description of various sexual situations and lacks what I would consider art. Reading Delta of Venus I felt like I was reading at more tasteful version of Letters to Penthouse. I must admit, this is my first exposure to Nin so I am not saying she is not a gifted author. I understand she was commissioned to write stories of this nature, I'm just saying I expected something more 
 I was very eager to read this book. Deirdre Mccloskey has a great reputation as talented and iconoclastic economist, as well as a gifted writer. One would not know this, however, from reading only her latest book, "The Bourgeois Virtues," which is the first of a planned four-book series.   This book is, simply put, a mess. Ostensibly an apologia for capitalism, organized around various traditional (and not so traditional) moral "virtues," in the tradition of Adam Smith's "The Theory of the Moral Sentiments," McCloskey's book is, in fact, a rambling, confused (or, at least, confusing), idiosyncratic, grandiose and self-serving diary of personal experiences and beliefs, complete with lengthy disquisitions on books, articles, films, poetry and music she either adores or detests. Her erudition is as impressive as it is obvious; she rather hits the reader over the head with it. She can cite more works from different disciplines -- both low-brow and high-brow -- on a single page, than most authors can manage in an entire chapter. At first, the reader is awe-struck by the vastness of her knowledge. Soon, however, the reader's head starts spinning from all the sharp turns and digressions, and fatigue sets in. For a while, one presses on, fighting the fatigue in the vain hope of a pay-off that never comes. Perhaps it will come in book 4 of the series. Now, I don't have a particular short time horizon (or high discount rate), but I'm not waiting until book 4 to find out where all of McCloskey's ruminations lead us.   Surprisingly, the author pays scant attention to economics throughout the book; and when she does mention the subject of her real expertise, the analysis is somewhere between skimpy and non-existent. She identifies herself as a Chicago-school economist, and to prove her bona fides she suggests in the book's executive summary that there is no such thing as a public good (citing as support only Coase's justly famous article about lighthouses in England, despite subsequent work by van Zandt showing that Coase's lighthouses were all heavily subsidized from public coffers). And in strong contrast to Adam Smith, who believed in publicly owned (or crown-owned) parks for purposes of public recreation (as opposed to lands privately-owned for economic production), McCloskey identifies herself as a "free-market environmentalist," who promotes priviatization of our national parks. Admittedly, these concerns reflect my interests as a scholar who works in the area of environmental law and economics. Nevertheless, McCloskey has a great deal of work left to do to explain to the readers why, in her ethical framework, all environmental goods should be private owned (as if they could be) and left exclusively to the work of market forces.    I may be missing something here. Perhaps this really is the most important book since "The Theory of the Moral Sentiments," and I just don't get it. Or, maybe I do get it and this is simply a bad book 
 Ok, I have LOVED Sophie since she hit the scene. But what the heck happen here? I'm stuck somewhere in the mid-beginning. I'm going to go back and finish it and will add to the review then, but right now I'm at a lost for words. Sophie come back! 
 could have been a truly interesting film, just plain simpleminded and annoying 
 I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided. 
 What a load of tripe. shes trying to hang on her sisters coat tails.  go back to acting joan cos you certainly can't write.  that's for sure 
 While Black and Blue does bring to light and make the readers aware of the depths and secrets involved in spousal abuse, it is rather difficult to identify with, like, or even feel anything for the protagonist.    Black and Blue explores the life of an abused woman who has attempted to disappear with her son in order to escape her abuser husband.  First of all, the book seems to me like a Lifetime Movie, almost cheesy if you will.  Half of the things the main character does, you are screaming at her in your head to not do them.  She is almost like the dumb girl in every horror movie, who runs up the stairs instead of out the door.    I found all of the characters in the book seem to have much more depth than the protagonist.  While I was rooting for her, it was because she was the victim, not because I actually liked or understood her.  She seemed weak, in that she really didn't do much of anything to help herself or her situation, either everyone else did everything for her, or things just kind of happened. Yes, it took a lot of guts to make that first phone call that was necessary in order for her to leave her husband, however, that was the only thing she ever really did for herself (pick up the phone).  Everything else was done for her, mostly without her knowledge.  She was doing something that was so hard to do, she should have felt like a strong woman to me, but she didn't not in the least and I attribute my feelings to poor character development and the actions as well as the non-actions of the main character.   One thing that annoyed me was the constant memory descriptions or flashbacks.  While they were integral to the story, they came at the oddest moments.  Sometimes it took you a few seconds to figure out if she was speaking her memory to someone else, if it was actually happening in real time, or it was all in her head.  In the middle of a conversation with someone she would suddenly reel into a 2 or more page memory in her head and then when the memory was over she would go right back into the conversation.  This left me having to go back a few pages to recall what the real-time conversation was even about.    Overall, the basics of the plot were interesting, as were some of the characters in the book.  The book does make one aware of the dangers of often hidden spousal abuse; however, it was not captivating.  I will not buy, recommend or read this book again. 
 This is definitely NOT one of my favorite books about stocks.  The title of the book is a little deceiving, the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits.  Chapters 1-4 are about general info, such as you must buy and sell to make money, don't hold for a long time. You must research the stock before purchase, EPS must increase every year.  I didn't find anything in those chapters that I didn't already know.   Chapters 5-10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell. Once again, the author talks about the obvious; buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip.    Chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques, the bull put spread.  This is not something that I use or will use in my trading.   Chapter 12 is the concluding chapter  
 First, I'd like to tell the authors that after reading this book,  each of you owe me a few hours of my time which disappeared, worthlessly, from my life.  What starts out as a great idea - a gaggle of writers each crafting a chapter of a novel - quickly crashes into a confusing, poorly played game of "telephone."   You know "telephone" - the kids' game where one whispers something to the person next to him or her and the words circle the room, ending in an incomprehensible string of gibberish?  Naked Came the Manatee is a hobo stew of styles, with each writer leading us through silly plot moves and adding their own characters.  While reading each of these authors might be fun, their collective sum only reveals a bookfull of defective parts 
 The first few times I made things from this book, they seemed off.  But Jamie is such the grab and go and not really measuring cook.  So I gave him the benefit of the doubt.  Then I tried one of his bread recipes... the Banana and Honey Bread (p.245) and using the basic bread recipe (p. 236).  Starting with the banana recipe, he says to puree 6 bananas and add water to equal two cups.  6 bananas pureed came out to way more than two cups... then I didnt know what to do about the water.  In the basic bread recipe, there it calls for 2 TABLESPOONS of level salt and 2 TABLESPOONS of level sugar.  The sugar I could understand, but I had to read the salt one over and over again.  I dont even use 2TBS of salt for a roasted chicken and I like salty foods.  Then the banana recipe did not call for the removal of the salt from the original recipe.  Needless to say, the bread did not turn out well was quite salty, among other things.  In retrospect, I think this book has suffered from the conversion from the British system of metrics to the American measurements.  I was really disappointed in how much energy and time and enjoyment I had poured into this book and Jamie Oliver, when someone did not care enough to proof the book and ensure that recipes were accurate and usable. I was so disappointed that despite the small fortune I used to collect the books, I decided to give them away with the belief that you should use the book for inspiration, and for recipes that do not call for exact measurements, otherwise, this is not really a cookbook but a selling of a celebrity or personality.  I was truly disappointed.  
 Let me start off by saying that I have higher degrees in art, art history, music, and Romance languages -- so I am an admitted "art snob." Having said that, I would recommend that you try the Baby Einstein "Baby Van Gogh, World of Colors" and "Baby Mozart" videos instead of this Brainy Baby video.  I find this Brainy Baby video to be slow, boring, insipid, condescending, and visually uninteresting; I cannot wait to put in something else. Wait, you say, isn't this about the baby who is watching it? Well, I first realized that it is truly boring (and not "just me") by watching my 6-month-old's reaction to it. (She is now 10 months old, and still does not like it.) She consistently snubbed her nose at this video; she did not watch it for more than a few seconds at a time and always turned away to find something more interesting to do. She has never had this reaction to the Einstein videos I mentioned.  I tried reintroducing this video every few weeks since she was 6 months old, thinking maybe she would grow to understand it better, but after 4 months of this approach, she still is not interested. However, the Einstein videos have captivated her from the beginning, and still do.  Here are the specifics that I think are the problem. The visuals are weak and not bold/colorful enough. My daughter is bored by watching the other babies play with toys. The female voice-over is distracting and annoying, rather than engaging and instructional as intended. The flow is not as coherent as the Einstein videos, which are broken into little themes that make sense in each video. There is no charm or sense of humor, like the Einstein videos.  No, I do not have any connection whatsoever to the Baby Einstein folks. I'm just saying that the Brainy Baby videos seem less professional and are not as engaging. If you're going to spend the money and spend your time watching a video with your baby, buy one that you and the baby will enjoy together 
 I can only judge the article on the the government failure in Tajikistan, as it is a country I both lived in and studied for many years.  The author, Nasrin Dadmehr, explains the weakness of the current state by examining its historical background, but that background, as he presents it, is full of omissions and inaccuracies.   For instance, the word "basmachi" used to describe the armed rebel groups in 1920's Central Asia, does not mean "bandits" in Russian, as he claims. It means nothing in Russian because it is not of Russian origin but was adopted from one of the local languages, Tajik or Uzbek.   Another example is that the author keeps referring to the two factions fighting for control over government as "Communists" and "Islamists". It is true that these labels have been exploited by both sides in order to attract foreign aid from countries where those things matter (such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, or Russia).  However, the actual division is based entirely on people's ethnic/regional affiliations. So unless you accept the idea that everyone born in Kulab is a Communist and a Gharmi accent automatically makes one a devout Muslim, those labels mean as much as the logos of two opposing teams in a football field.  Chicago Bears are not really bears, the "Islamist opposition forces" are not united by Islam, and there has not been any Communists in Tajikistan for many years, apart from perhaps a few senior citizens nostalgic for the times when they had something to eat. So whenever anyone describes the conflict in Tajikistan as a struggle between Communists and Islamists it is a good indication that they have very little knowledge or understanding of the political situation in that country.  There are plenty of other inaccuracies as well, like the description of May 1992 events. According to the author, this is when "backed by popular support and two months of non-stop demonstrations <the opposition forces> succeeded in imposing a coalition government on the communists." In reality, the "imposing" part involved an ambush of the city airport by a heavily armed group of militants who proceeded to capture President Nabiyev as he was trying to flee the country and forced him, at a gunpoint, to sign his resignation. There was no "coalition government" created, and the following few months of the opposition's rule were filled with as much oppression and extreme violence towards Kulabis as was later directed at Gharmis when the power switched back around.   The two-month long non-stop demonstrations that had led to this incident included one for the opposition and one supporting the government. Both were heavily organized, with people being recruited and bussed in from remote villages to be fed, clothed, and financially compensated for the two months of camping in the middle of the city. No information about who was paying for all that "expression of popular will" on either side was ever publicly released.   Even if these omissions in the article seem minor or irrelevant, they reduce the complexity of the war in Tajikistan to a "goodies vs. baddies" comic-book type scaffle that incidentally brings about the collapse of the government. The collapse itself and the resulting chaos is described quite well. But glancing over so many important aspects of what had led to it makes the resulting analysis somewhat skewed and one-sided 
 I read this book because I was desperately in need of something to entertain me for a rather long flight, and it was the only thing I could find on a shelf at a train station other than a few romances that I wouldn't come near with a ten-foot pole.  Anyway. On to the review -  It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.  That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight. It was a tolerable read for the most part.  Baldacci's a decent storyteller, but a sucky writer 
 This book might be great for some people... I just wasn't one of them. I like Robin Mckinley, I loved "Beauty" by her, and I really really wanted to love this book... but I didn't. I would advise anyone interested in buying it to make sure they read the first few pages of the books first. If the style didn't bother you, and your mind didn't start to go numb then this might be the book for you. And more power to you! But don't just buy the book because it's written by Robin Mckinley... in my humble opinion it's definately not her best work. For me it drug on and on and on, I couldn't even finish it, I got halfway through and decided I couldn't handle the migraines the book was inducing. But that's just me, like I said read a couple of pages and decide for yourself. If you dont like the first couple of pages though... don't except it to get any better... it doesn't 
 After about 10 weeks of intensive dance lessons or a season of cheer practice your child should be easily able to perform the first five minutes of the "warm up".  Otherwise, they will be very frustrated. It is very fast, very complicated.  Well Choregraphed but even the "break it down" segment moves at double speed.   
 I don't even know what to say about this book other than anyone who pretends to like this nonsense deserves to read it. Truman Capote's quote about Kerouac's writing, "That it's not writing, it's typing," probably sums up the matter better than anything I can say.  What disappoints me I suppose is that I really want to like Kerouac - I love the idea of him, though I can't say I care much for his typing.

 Words fail me, which is not usual at all. All I can say is if they decide to do another one of these things for God's sake pick an editor that knows what he's doing 
 I read this , but can barely remember what it said. Repetitive, stale, and  not well-written. I bought it for her name because I like the 'Best  American Erotica" books, but won't make that mistake again 
 This book is way too short for such an interesting topic. Another problem is that it depicts women as main victims of weird medical practices in 19th and early 20th century, which is not entirely true. At those times (and may be true today in some cases also) one would be far better off if one stayed away from medical profession. Also, there are some really hillarious things about treating hysteria which authors didnot bother to mention. For the hystory of vibrators as legitimate medical treatment for hysteria, Rachel Maines has done very good job in dealing with this topic. What is also a pity is that authors didn't pursue various medical superstitions about females and different treatment of females which are present in modern times. For example, nobody questions the articles published in peer reviewed medical journal which state that patient's absolute refusal is "relative contraindication" for performing episiotomy. Is there any other surgical procedure which can be inflicted on a patient against patient's explicitly stated wishes? Or for example the fact that many health insurances cover Viagra but don't cover contraceptives. There are many topics well worth investigation which belog to the topic "Complaints and Disorders : The Sexual Politics of Sickness" which authors have chosen not to address in this pamphlet (can't even call it a book) 
 If I could burn this book, I would.  It is that bad.  For an "Introduction" book used in an intro MBA class where most accounting types have already tested out of the class it is overly complex and confusing to the layman.  Wordy beyond belief.  The only redeeming feature is its ability to put you to sleep.  Keep it on the bed stand 
 "In Her Day" is feminism at her worst. The story follows the romantic tryst between Isle, a 20-something activist zealously fighting the cause for women's rights, and Carole, the experienced, 40-something art professor who has figured out how to choose her battles wisely. Together the two argue women's ideologies. That's about it. Add a cast of quirky-but- lackluster characters and you've got a novel doesn't amount to much. There was just too much opinion and not enough emotion. There was nothing human about the characters that made me care about them. Definitely not a good read as I labored through it far longer than I should 
 This book is a joke.  It is written by a guy who has followed Colin Powell around and has taken a lot of notes on what he has said.  He then put together a bunch of Powell's stories and comments into this book.  The "secrets" are not secrets at all.  They are common sense to most people.  After the first couple of chapters I realized that I was wasting my time trying to read each word and just went to the summaries at the end of each chapter.  It's all summed up there.  Powell did not contribute to this book, he was merely a speaker who fed the author enough information to pull this book together 
 As a long-time fan of all things Our Lady Peace, I could hardly wait for this new disc to be released. Stoked by postings on message boards and tidbits of song bites on the internet, I expected the band's sixth full-length offering to expound on the "rawness" of Gravity, fulfill the promise of songs like "Our Time is Fading" from the live CD/DVD,  and further solidify the band's self-proclaimed new direction after the departure of Mike Turner. Healthy was to be the culmination of three years worth of waiting and wanting; another well-crafted OLP tome flashing bits of brilliant melody and inspirational muse.    This could not have been further from the case...  If Healthy had turned out to be Gravity II, then at least the band would have had the benefit of remaining stagnant. Instead, OLP seems to take several steps back, sacrificing their identify in efforts to emulate other genres (the garage-rock-ish "Where are you?"), ditching their unique "open" single guitar sound and ambiance (the guitar laden "Angles/Losing/Sleep"), and regressing lyrically ("Apology's" "I'm the lock, you're the key"). The overtly political "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face" suffers from repetition, "wipe that smile, wipe that smile, I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face... wipe that smile, wipe that smile...", and the Beatle-esque (if the Beatles could ever write something so brash) "World On A String" is downright annoying. "Don't Stop" seems to be the only bright spot on the record although there are moments in other tunes as well. As mentioned in previous reviews, it would have been interesting to hear the other tracks that didn't make the record; perhaps they might have harbored the type of emotional and musical genuineness OLP is known for.      In all fairness to the band, I wonder if the injection of Bob Rock into the recording was more of a detriment than a blessing. Gone are the days of OLP's traditionally "spatial" sounding records, replaced instead with Rock's patented wall of sound massiveness. While his recording techniques served Gravity well, one has to wonder, with the influx of band disquietude and their seemingly loss of internal direction, (as evident by the accompanying DVD in Healthy) has Bob steered the Canadian quartet down the most beneficial path? His influence is legendary, one need not look any further than Metallica's Some Kind of Monster DVD to witness his propensity to direct, and it begs the question; How much Rock is Healthy? Sure the CD has OLP's trademark dynamics, Raine's unique and imaginative voice, Jeremy's rock-solid percussion, Duncan's spot on bass lines, and even Steve's thin but ample guitar tracks, but Healthy sounds less like OLP and more like OLP trying to sound like some else. Perhaps the will of the band has dipped too far in commercialism direction; perhaps the CD is just an accurate depiction of a band without a definitive "sound"; regardless of the reason, Rock and crew have crafted an eclectic mix of eccentric, enigmatic songs that seem to suffocate underneath any political statements OLP is trying so desperately to make. This is definitely a record with an agenda, and it's clear that agenda had nothing to do with focusing on the substance of its songs... 
 A shining star in the quest for the most incomplete work ever published by credible institutions, David Griffiths triumphs over both the competition and his other works with his widely-distributed Third Edition of Introduction to Electrodynamics.  The useful life of this book is 6 months, as that is how long it takes physics students to complete the intermediate level sequence on electricity and magnetism. Because most of the meaningful content of this book that would make it (at least) more complete gets reproduced by teachers in classroom lectures, both graduate students and undergraduate students must redo homework problems, never again to know if their answer is correct, in reassurance that they still know the concepts that they were taught months or years ago. Even the few sections of the book with worded analysis instead of mathematical analysis depend so strongly on the mathematics once again that without a complete word-based definition and explanation, no student can sit down with the book for any less than 30 minutes at a time to identify and restudy key concepts. In fact, the only chance that students have of cutting out 29 of those 30 minutes is by looking at the formulas in the front and back covers of the book, many (particularly those in the back) of which students should already have memorized from completing the sequence. If only Griffiths would add "By looking in the back of the book" before spitting out "Easy" or "Obviously" every few sections, students would not be so nearly put down by such a travesty of a science textbook.  The impossibility for students to learn from the hundreds of missing steps in derivations throughout the book (which you get to see in their entirety for the price of your tuition), the lack of page references or useful word-based explanations of terms, and Griffith's "obvious" attitude problem serve to make Introduction to Electrodynamics the worst book ever 
 this was certainly not one of Cornwell's best works.  IT was almost like a couple of possible novels rolled into one.  It read like a draft for a novel rather tahn a complete novel 
 "Wise Blood" could more aptly be called "Stupid Minds."  Both titles are tendentious, but the latter is more accurate.  Ms. O'Connor depicts a pair of Southern troglodytes in the grip of religious mania.  We are meant to regard their fanaticism as a form of primal wisdom; in fact, it is merely ludicrous or pathetic.  Those who deem this judgment parochial should ask themselves whether Ms. O'Connor, an Orthodox Roman Catholic, was any less so.   Faulkner plumbed the humanity within or beneath the grotesque.  Ms. O'Connor is more interested in the God-driven grotesqueness that warps humanity; she sees it as higher knowledge.  Her prose in this early effort is merely workmanlike, and time has made what was strange or shocking in her vision seem familiar.  If blood wisdom were truly wisdom, an Islamic terrorist would be wise 
 First, let me get on my soapbox once more to decry the 'star inflation' that is found on this website.  I mean, get real, are all the books out there really deserving of 5 stars!  This book is a case in point.  Don't get me wrong, memoirs are my favorite genre.  But this book is tedious.  Beth is a very likable person, only it seemed like she couldn't make up her mind.  Did she want to write a memoir, or a book of essays on friendship?  Instead of choosing one, she decided to do both;  without pulling it off.  I also did not find her prose to be luminous or poetic, but overwraught.  Sorry.  Finally, at several points in the book I got the feeling that Beth was searching out friendship opportunities with an eye that they could be included in the book she was working on.  Beth, if you ever read this, please don't be discouraged by this review.  You do have talent.  Just don't try so hard 
 Normally I love documentaries.  I've watched hundreds of them and with one exception I have loved them all.  However, OUTFOXED is the single most boring film I have ever seen.    A relentless rant against Rupert Murdoch's cable news station, this film could possibly interest someone who is singlemindedly obsessed with Fox News, but I cannot imagine that anyone on earth is interested enough in Fox News to remain awake while watching this movie.  Watching OUTFOXED makes me realize what a genius Michael Moore is.  Whether you love him or hate him, whether you agree with him or not, you have to admit his films are entertaining.  This film, however, is a major bore.  - Regina McMenami 
 Peter Mew (remastering engineer at Abbey Road) continues to play George Lucas by destroying many of my favorite albums. Why does he feel the need to over process everything with noise reduction?   STOP SMOTHERING MY MUSIC WITH NOISE REDUCTION!!!!!!    Noise reduction sucks the life and space out of music. It makes 24 bit recordings sounds like chirpy MP3s. If you think this remaster sounds good you need to educate yourself with the many audible artifacts left behind from the No-Noise? processing. Once you learn it you'll hear why all of us are upset over its use 
 This album is extremely average compared to solo D-Block albums. I also thought there was not enough Jadakiss. I only liked about 4 tracks on the whole album and did not deserve much more than one star. Sheek Louch's album 'After Taxes' was much better than this and i hope future D-Block albums are not in any way similar to this one. I think the D-Block/G-Unit complications make D-Block weaker and the dissing of G-Unit does not really work all that well. I do really hope that the next album is an improvement to this one. 
 unlike other more chill travis discs like "the man who" and "invisible band," this cd is really pretty heavy.  I gave the cd away to a buddy of mine who likes hard rock and he loves it.  This is not a cd to put on and relax to

 Ms Rose is without a doubt a talented writer, but her work here is tediously self-indulgent and trite and sheds very little light on Proust, or indeed on his effect on her. Give it a miss and read the master! I don't think I'll be visiting Ms Rose's other work anytime soon.. 
 OK. I bought the book, Linux Toys, for one reason and one reason only: Chapter 15 - Digital Picture Frame. There is just not enough info in the book for neophites such as myself. The website: www/linuxtoys.com does not help either 
 I was looking for a real thriller, and thought I would try one by David Baldacci. I had read a very favourable review a while back, and I have also seen and enjoyed the movie version of Absolute Power.  After reading reviews at Amazon, I picked Last Man Standing. However, I was really disappointed. For me it wasn't thrilling at all. Several times I had to force myself to pick it up again to continue reading. For me, a good thriller is a book you can't stop reading, even if it's getting late and you really, really should try to get some sleep instead of continue reading.  Examples of great thrillers I have read are: The Firm by John Grisham, The Day After Tomorrow by Allan Folsom (nothing to do with the weather-related movie of the same name) and Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.  But Last Man Standing was quite the opposite. Sure it had its moments where it got exciting for a while (the final shoot-out for example), but those times were quite rare.  I've been trying to figure out why I didn't like it, but I can't say I know why. I do think that a lot of what happens in the book is quite far-fetched (especially the reason the hero Web London froze during the ambush) and that the characters are pretty one-dimensional, but that's not enough of a reason. Both The Day After Tomorrow and Angels and Demons have plenty of far-fetch twists and one-dimensional characters, but they were still exciting reads. I can't come up with a definite answer as to why I didn't like Last Man Standing - I simply just didn't care for it.  Writing a negative review like this will probably earn me a few unhelpful votes, but I think it is important to also review books you didn't like. Otherwise you risk getting an unbalanced view. However, I do admit that it is much more fun to review books you really liked.  But to finish, if you are looking for a good thriller, skip this one and try one of the other three I mentioned above. 
 I enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy. However, this third book needs some serious time in the Intensive Book Surgery Unit before it should have even been published. Frankly, this manuscript should have been kicked back from the editor to the author and refused. I realize that's a pretty heavy thing to say, but it's true. Something went badly wrong here.  The author did not do his job in bringing his protagonists to closure; having two kids fall in love, then decide to live apart for the rest of their lives is a complete crock. Puhleaze. I grew to rather like the aeronaut Texan and the explorer, and they're killed to little point. Puhleaze. Iorek the Bear is darn cool, and he barely (sorry) makes an appearance in book 3. Puhleaze. And, by the way, who is Mary, introduced so late in the trilogy, as an underfunded Dark Matter physicist (who just happens to be ... an ex-nun ... now, just wait a minute here, is that heavy handed or what?)... and Dark Matter would be *under* funded? Puhleaze. (Although these days, she'd be working on Global Warming.) And Mrs. Coulter, in a lifetime full of being evil, suddenly has a turn of heart (yes, just like The Grinch), and, in her new fullsome of goodness, helps kill an angel. Huh? What? Say that again?     I was thrilled (not) at Pullman's description of an endless, boring ... [come to think of it, very much like reading Volume III of this trilogy] ... somewhat-Purgatory-Without-Dante's-Skill that apparently is his vision of death. Everyone stands around being ... boring. Gosh, how exciting, what a vision, et cetera. It's duller than the endless views of the Enterprise in Star Trek I. It's more boring than the endless endless views of the Discovery in 2001: A Space Odyssey. When the dead people standing around there are given the chance to decompose, they go for the gusto. As to why any of this should be in a book, I can only offer my puzzlement.       Jerry Pournelle once gave me some terrific advice. "Never give a reader a chance to put down one of your books, because if you do, they will, and they'll never pick it up again.". I zoomed non-stop through the first two books of this trilogy. The last book took me a week plus and I was extremely annoyed with it.   I was amused that Philip Pullman, in his Afterword, gives credit to stealing his ideas (those are his words) from Paradise Lost (John Milton). Frankly, I wish he had stolen more, this book would have been better. His utter hatred of The Church shines through this book. He has sort of an Idiot's Guide to Quantum Mechanics but isn't up on it.     This mess needs to be storyboarded, and everything that does not PROMOTE THE STORY needs to be chucked out. And that's about half of this book. Whoever edited this book badly needs to be chewed out. I suspect, though, that it boiled down to "not enough time to fix" in the publishing schedule; Del Rey is not noted for publishing messes like this.  
 i really liked the first one and even went to my mom's house to pick up the second one (this) at 10:30 at night right after i had finished it because i was so pumped to read on. from the get go i could not get into this book and i had to force myself to get to page 120. not much has happened to make me want to finish it. very boring. not really into roz and mitch characters, i don't think they are very well developed, they seem kind of blah. and the story is kind of blah. blah, blah, blah, and just words for the blah, blah, blah going on and on.  
 I loved the first (1970s) edition of this cookbook, just as I do Mollie Katzen's other books, and those by the Moosewood Collective.  Unfortunately, however, everything I tried from this book was a poor imitation of the version in the first book (and many were grossly inedible).  If you want a good, healthy vegetarian book, I recommend those by Martha Rose Schulman (I've never had a failure with any of her recipes; even the fat-free, salt-free are okay), or Moosewood's Low-Fat Favorites (which vary in quality; some are wonderful and other's mediocre, but none were this bad 
 On the Far Side of the Mountain is about Sam Gribley, who lives on the Catskill Mountains. He eventually is also burdened with his sister living there, and must leave the safety of the mountain to save her with his friend Bando.  This book has some action and adventure, but not enough for my taste. I didn't appeal to that or the characters. It was basically about outdoor survival, which is much better done in other books, like Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.  I would recommend reading other, more exciting books, like Hatchet,instead of this one. 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 This coffee doesn't have anything special about it. I like good Kona coffee and I think 2 stars really tells it all 
 In general this was an ok product.  It was too big clumsy for the car but my son liked to play with it in the house.  It would be a good buy at $15 but no more than that 
 I wish I could give this book less than one star.  First the title: Think like a guy, it doesn't tell you at all how to think like a guy or what guys think.  This book only gives you a list of tips on how to be fake with a man.  The title should be "Lie, Pretend, and Be Confusing" She actually tells you to change who you are and to play games.  Like one tip is to always call *67 so he doesn't know it's you.  And one tip is to order out and dirty up dishes so that he thinks you cooked (which isn't fair to those of us who really know how to cook- what girl can complete with take out?)  So now what happens in the long term when he finds out that you lied and the betty crocker that he fell in love with is a phony?  Second, it has no substance.  The chapters are about a page long (some only a few words long) which states the tip and then a few paragraphs about the tip that says nothing more than what the tip said.  The book basically could have been a list of 66 tips- nothing more nothing less. This book is a 20 minute waste.  There are far better books 
 i read this book on advice of a friend, so i finished it.  but i didn't find this book gripping or inspirational.  i didn't have sympathy for any of the characters and the writing was bloated.  while i was reading i found my mind wandering and didn't feel a need to go back and read paragraphs or sentences i missed while wandering.  the characters are somewhat true to life in that they are total environmental hypocrites, but the book didn't present this as something to work on avoiding. overall a long read that just made me realize why so many people hate tree huggers 
 Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books).  It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events.  The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books).  The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: "HUH??" This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read.  It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and "Forget about it" 
 I like reading.  I am a literature snob.  I put down poorly written novels (even though I can't write well myself!).  But, I think I've met my match in this novel.  I recognize the style is something unique, but I just couldn't grasp the rhythm.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with those who gave this book thumbs down.  I really want to be in the group that appreciates this Plitzer Prize novel, but I don't make the cut.        HOwever, I'd love to read more from reviewers on what they saw in this book because I just couldn't find much other than the rambling thoughts of a very whiny and boring 40-something man whom I would't enjoy spending a 3-day-weekend with at all.        I've persistantly struggled through 180 pages, but now will surrender!   
 Do not buy this book unless you want to be insulted. This book is based on the baseless opinions, ridiculous generalities and the WORST of gender stereotypes. He argues that "women are not born to be leaders" and "women are emotional thinkers." This book is inane, illogical and downright offensive to any women or girls who respect themselves. Quite frankly, I am angered that anyone even published this book. 
 It was an ok book. I think that it takes a very special talent to write a historical journal and this author didn't have it. With a journal you are suppose to write your personal feelings and thoughts. But this author never really wrote Catherine's feelings, which misses a big opportunity to relate to the character. Also with journals normally that have one big problem and then small every day problems. The one big problem is resolved at the end of the book and the small problems are resolved in about a week. A Gathering of Days didn't have every day problems and had three some what big problems that were never drawn out. It is a quick read and great if you are doing a lot of research on that time period with other books. If you are reading this for fun don't bother its not entertaining.   ~Ken 
 Have you seen the smarmy come-ons for shonky products? Sometimes advertised on TV or radio. With a free 800 phone number you can call, for free material. Sounds promising, you think. But then when the literature arrives, it's little more than a push to buy the "premium" stuff. That is what Horner's book feels like. She waffles all over the place, with interminable babble about the greatness of her method. Yet a careful parsing of the book shows little substance. All the while "subtly" mentioning her website with the hot stuff. Bait and switch.  Well, you could save some money and avoid this book. But unlike some others who suggested you visit her website and drop $400, I would recommend also avoiding it. Given the vapidness of the book, it is not a good precursor 
 Another Catherine Breillart examination of a weird-ass French chick.  I have a hunch that is a description of the writer/director herself.  At any rate, the real interest became a guessing game as to what inanimate object the heroine would insert in herself next.  A trying and boring distillation of everything that is absurd and exasperating with introspective, obsessive intellectualism. The young lady is lovely, and I hope she found better material for herself in her later career.  Whenever I am exposed to one of these extravaganzas of repulsive people doing shocking things, I always think of Elliot Gould as the photographer in Little Murders, who is embraced and lionized by the intelligencia when he starts photographing dog poo on the streets of New York.  And why not?  Isn't it nature?  Doesn't it symbolize and comment on the way we live? Yeah, right. Have fun.  
 I'm not sure that this book supports the best way to handle bullies.  The responses she suggests seem to have a somewhat "smart alec" and/or "sarcastic" tone about them.  Some of the responses are just down right silly, which might result in a child getting picked on even more 
 You talk about disappointed, this is the icing on the cake.  All I hear about is how scary and cutting edge this was.  Not even close.  Whatever big shot film critics say that are truly wrong.  I love older movies too and am open minded to the change in times and such. There are actually some scary or at least entertaining horror flicks during the 70's, but this is not one of them....seriously, don't buy this.  I don't know why it is so highly regarded.  The acting, story, and especially the music is EL TERRIBLE'.  It's like porn quality acting, a story written in about 25 minutes and music from a Disney movie.  It could have been a good movie if they would have taken out the attempt at comedy, through in some disturbing music, and made the bad guys, well, more bad.  It could be remade (which i'm usually against) 
 This could have been very interesting. Many excellent books are written that are based on other people's ideas about writing - not the author's. One comes to mind : Walking on Alligators. Although to be fair, the Alligators's author does add her own comment and "affirmation" and those are just as important as the corresponding writer's quote.  Note that the author of the Writer's Workshop in a Box has only written a preface to the tiny book The art of Writing. Every 6 chapters are excerpts from such books as The Artist's Way and Beyond The Words.  There are many problems with this "workshop in a box". One is the packaging : the cover is beautiful, but deceptive. Inside the box, which is more like a book that you open, and which contains many slots, for everything that it contains, well... everything is a disapointment. The notebook is ugly, not at all like the cover, not sylish, more like very out of style, the pen is a very plain one, and the selection of excerpts found in The Art of Writing manual are from books that I have already read. Everything is gray/sepia, all washed-out.  The author selected excerpts from Cameron, Goldberg (Bonni), and Maisel's books. I suggest that you go to the sources, read Beyond The Words by Bonni Goldberg (an excellent book, you can find it for a few bucks in stores that sell books that have been returned to the publisher), read The Artist's Way, read Becoming a Writer. Buy yourself a less narrow notebook which you can open flat more easily, buy yourself a good pen, and forget about any book that wants to workshop you the whole nine yards about writing fiction and non-fiction in 96 small pages, and taking its lessons from the great "masters of writing like Julia Cameron".  The cards are too big to shuffle, and made out of thin cardboard that isn't treated (glossied, plastified), meaning that any humidity will ruin them. On one side is an ugly photo (by one of two unknow photographers, probably friends of the author) in sepia, and on the other side is a suggested activity. Some are good (but not original), such as write first thing in the morning each day for a week, and others are original but won't work for me, such as be attentive to commercials seen on tv and make out a story based on a commercial you find intriguing. There are 30 cards.  There are better gimmiks out there : The Observation Deck, the Autobiography Box (this last one is so cute, but I never used it). There's even a book on I Ching for writers coming out soon, that you can pre-order. It's too bad that there is no "search in the book" or any preview pages to look at. I know that the cover is beautiful. It is great design, really nice. The description is tempting, there are even some rare reviews out there (from obscure sources) that don't seem to trash this merchandise product. Resist.   PS : There is one delightful book you could get now, that you probably don't have already : No Plot, no problems! Not even gimmicky, it is unpretentious, fun, and very encouraging. 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 My 1 year old son loves the Little Einsteins show, so I bought him this book.  I am sorely disappointed with the book, and my son doesn't care for it.  It's a complete ripoff from the Farmer Annie's Garden episode, and doesn't add anything to it.  There is only one lift flap per page.  The book could use more substance 
   One of the posters on here claimed that this CD was as good as "Force Behind The Power" - and nothing could be further from the truth.  Diana's voice as we once knew it, is gone.  She sings mainly from her lower register now, and all of the power in her voice has disappeared.  She needs to give up her pride and get serious with a vocal coach, or just give it up altogether. The batch of songs on here don't make any kind of impression, with the exception of Marvin Gaye's "I Want You" - the only track that evokes the seductive spirit that Ross is known for.  I don't know how this project was put together, but I doubt Ross ever spent time in the studio with the musicians who play on the tracks.  A couple of the songs sound like they were recorded in the wrong key.  The only way this work will sell, will be if she pulls off a remarkable performance of one of the songs on one of her many personal appearances next week in TV Land.  I doubt the CD will even break into the 200 Album Chart.  Sorry D. 
 I think those readers who are interested in erotic stories may find the selections in this audio tape a bit "technical" sounding.  The terminology used fell short of my definition of eroticism.  I would pass on  this selection 
 Ordinary looking steel mug. It does not have a lid which defeats the purpose of having doube insulation. I did not find the quality of insulation that great either. Too pricey for the features it offers. 
 Chapter one of this pathetic book begins by informing us that "Business cases aren't romance novels. Things begin, and end, with the numbers". Not so this book. As well as seemingly endless diversions into such eclectic themes as post war land reform in Japan, General MacArthur's victorious cavalcade into Tokyo, hitch hiking in New England, some unfathomable nonsense about the "mystic Southwest" of the United States, a reference to Mary Poppins, a couple of paragraphs on Bruce Springsteen, the problems of mowing lawns in Utah, the relatively high mortality rates of upper class Britons during both world wars, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the usual sociological drivel of upwardly pointing nails getting hammered down in Japan, some buzz words from complexity theory, some tips on putting golf balls and interminable pages of insipid tips on how to turn your (non Docomo related) work into fun, we are given six shallow chapters respectively titled Love, Inequality, Impatience, Luck, Fun and Strength with a further appendix called Intimacy and M-Commerce. That is followed by a mercifully short interview with Docomo President Kouji Ohboshi, which, because it was originally carried in 1996, is, like the entire book, totally irrelevant to the current market conditions Docomo faces. Although the book's blurb claims the authors had unprecedented access to Docomo's top executives, there is no evidence of that in this over priced book.  We are, however, told that Ohboshi "looks like a conventional Japanese executive. He is tall". We are also told that he has the style of a cockroach, meaning that he is impatient and hurries around a lot. Because cockroaches tend to get stamped on, it is a dangerous and, at best, very silly metaphor to describe a dynamic CEO of a thriving company.  It is almost as silly as the 20 or so pages given to the digital experiences of Yasuko Sato who, we are told, had to overcome the sad fact that "Mama and Papa Sato lovingly, relentlessly instilled good old-fashioned analog values in their daughter." Although Mama and Papa Hayes did the same, I have used mobile phones in the jungles of the Golden Triangle and the Andes Mountains as well as in a fishing trawler 300 miles off the coast of Iceland. Talking about the wonders of i-mode or mobile phones in the tones Mitch and John (as they annoyingly call themselves throughout the book) is like talking of the wonders of black and white TV; they are old news. To impress on us how successful Docomo has been, we are supposed to be amazed that its headquarters are in "a skyscraper so large that each elevator holds sixty-three people. Sixty-three! In just one elevator!" As if that was not penance enough for us to bear, the authors appeal to our vanity by telling us that we are the new "cosmopolitan, global kind of thinker" because we are reading a "whole book" on Docomo.  Instead of giving us a "whole book" on Docomo, all they serve us up is the most shameless padding that would make the laziest high school student blush. Only two paragraphs after mentioning "those alphabet soup economics equations that make so little sense to most of us", we read "Okay, enough about boring economic theories" and we are back to the problems of mowing the lawns of Utah. Technical details are also, we are told on page 127, "perennially boring" even though they are vital to understand Docomo's short history as well as its prospects for future success. The mobile telephony industry Docomo finds itself in is a young industry, one that will mature in time just as wireless, television and the Internet did before it. Until that happens, the industry's many intangibles will complicate our best efforts to predict the industry's future trends. Instead of trying to identify those intangibles, the authors let us know that "what we can tell you, after years in think thanks and universities and high-powered consulting firms" is that luck is paramount in a successful business. This is easily the worst business book I have ever read, let alone reviewed. 
 With so many good reviews (5 stars), somebody doesn't know what makes a good book.  Maybe its me, but I was so disappointed in this book.  If you think this is going to be a great story about the wizards of bletchley park, keep shopping.  Its not.  Its page after page (600 +) of nails across the chalkboard tedium 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 As I read this book, what became evident was that his story was an eloquent rendering of deep stage alcoholism and drug addiction and that his depression was not the cause of those things, but a result of those things.  Pity that the author doesn't arrive at this understanding, as it may have helped him.  
 I purchased this book as part of a required reading for my high school honors geometry course. It is perhaps the most utterly boring and fanatical piece of fiction I have ever read. Not only is the book completely devoid of plot, it is lacking in all aspects of what a true work of fiction should include. This book has not educated me further on geometric concepts, nor has it enlightened me of any time period of which this book is said to be mirroring. Instead, it has wasted my time, which is precious to me now, and has completely confused me. Do not purchase this book. Do not assign it as required reading and most definitely do not read it for pleasure. There are other 80 page books that you can spend your time on.  Read anything else before you read Flatland 
 This movie tries way too hard to the point that it becomes a painful melodrama filled with gratuitous dialogue and over-acting.  I found this movie to be thoroughly unsatisfying 
 You might want to take the author's viewpoint into consideration when deciding whether or not to purchase this book. For example, on page 133, he says, 'I use no gods, except the concept of a creative source. In my religion, there are only three people: Me, myself, and I.&quot 
 William Dembski is one of the great names in the Intelligent Design-movement.  He holds a Ph.D. in mathematics and philosophy, and have earned grades in theology an psychology. When such a man writes a book and call it "Intelligent Design - The bridge between science & theology" I had great expectations that he had succeeded in making this important bridge.  I think  you can read this book in at least two ways.  One, as an introduction to how the leading people behind this movement think, and for such a presentation I give the book 4 stars.  Dembski is very good at using interesting parables to illustrate his arguments.  But as a bridge between science and theology it is totally failing.  And that is sad because the probability for Intelligent Design is in fact high as Dembski shows us, but Dembski mess it up through most of his book.  As science I give this book 1 star and end up with a compromise at 2 stars.  Dembski uses much space to general logic.  As to show that if you have two similar books containing the same Shakespeare-play, these two books doesn't have any more information together than one of the books alone.  OK. And so what?  After pages with such stuff you begin to be impatience and wonder how and when will all this logical stuff be used to prove Intelligent Design?  And then, as you have waited and waited, Dembski finally writes that it is not space in this chapter (and not in other chapters either)to explain the Big Bang by his Intelligent Design theories.  What a disappointment.  Couldn't he instead have skipped some of the logic?  But after a while you understand that Dembski actually lacks any intentions to reveal the most basic things that normally should have concerned Intelligent Design.  He claims that intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature in nature, and that these signatures are observable.  Why can't he tell us what this observable signatures are? He writes that God's fingerprints in nature are imperically detectible. But how? Why wont he tell us?   Dembski writes that something is made by intelligence when it can show both complexity and specification.  Ink spelt on a paper can show some complexity in pattern, but it is not specified before the ink spells letters and words with meaning.  He then uses this criteria for intelligent design in nature, and call it science and a proof of Intelligent Design when nature is both complex and specified. But can you prove God this way?  I think you only can believe in Intelligent Design, and that a strong probability for God never fully can prove Him anyway. Dembski does not try to prove God either, he just confirm that God exists because he have seen him in nature as the result of intelligent design.  No one can criticise you for believing in an intelligent designer, but if you want to make this belief into science, it is not enough just to call it science, as Dembski does.  You have to fullfill certain criteria and rules to call something science.  Dembski dosen't follow these rules at all.    Dembski spend much of his time in this book to criticise others for not being scientific, often just because they don't accept Intelligent Design as science.  He says that naturalism is metaphysic, and not science based on evidence.  If he had used his own definitions he uses on others, the Intelligent Design he presents wouldn't either be scientific.      He neither seems to remember what he wrote some pages earlier. After "proving" that Christ was the Logo by which the world was created, he later writes that Intelligent Design not necessarily must have originated from any specifically god at all. Are you confused like me?  An interesting objection to the kind of Intelligent Design that Dembski presents, namely that God interacts and design the nature all the time, is why then He design crippled people, hiv-virus an so on all the time?  Dembski just brush those with such objections off by calling them unscientific. If Dembski instead had advocated that God started it all by "shooting a billiard ball" with a very precision, that interacted with other "balls" that fine-tuned the universe and started the evolution that eventually ended up with the complicated human being, Dembski could have accepted naturalism as well as Intelligent Design, and then nature could have been responsible, at least in some way, for it's mishaps instead of blaming God, as Dembskis theories leads towards, though he denies it.  In this book Dembski claims to represent, among others, the 90 % of the people in the United States who believe that some kind of transcendent force created the world. I believe the same, but fear that books like this more destroy than helps to make a bridge between science and theology.  
 "Le Morte d'Arthur" or "The Death of Arthur" is an exceptionaly long and boring book no one should ever have to read 
 I've read other titles by Carlton Smith and have enjoyed most of them. However, "Reckless" is by far the worst book I've read in quite some time. In fact, I had to force myself to finish it. One is led to believe by the back cover of the book that the story is about the murder of Lana Clarkson. Don't be misled. It really isn't about Lana Clarkson at all. It's almost entirely about Phil Spector and his life as a record producer. Smith quotes heavily from two other books in this story. It's almost as if he wrote a repeat of what has already been written before by someone else. Save your time and money 
 Had I known Maureen was married to right-winger Tim Russert, I would have never bought this book.  After digesting my mistake, I decided to get my money's worth - and what a disappointment!  Like a few reviewers pointed out, these are reprints of Vanity Fair articles from years past.  All one has to do is look at the very end of each "chapter" for the updates, and you'll get the idea of this "book."  She is a good writer and has a way of letting out her opinion without being confrontational about it.  She told the deep, dark ugly truth about the overrated has-been Michael Jackson (who hit his peak with 1983's "Thriller," made a somewhat good comeback with "Bad" in 1987 and has only been kept in the public eye since then due to the trashy tabloids and his weird antics).  As for Laci Peterson: That's another topic she was right on about.  There's a case going on right now in Philadelphia about a missing pregnant woman who is only getting so much media attention because she is related to a city councilman so I completely dig her point that some cases get more publicity than others because family and/or friends are media-savvy.    But had this been an *original* piece of writing, Maureen should have widened her scope to include why political pundits (including her own husband) are treated as celebrities.  Writers usually take a backseat to the things they write about but that is definitely not the case anymore as the persona means much more than the substance.  I was very disappointed that I spent money for what I thought was going to be a book when I could have saved myself the dough and read back issues of V.F.  Wait until this is in the Last Chance bin at your local (chain) bookstore 
 When I first heard about this book, I rushed to find it on Amazon and added it to my wish list.  I patiently awaited it's release and was very happy to receive my copy.  After savoring it for a day or so I sat down and began to read it.  My wife, who does not understand, but accepts, my addiction to fantasy sports, thought I would finish the book in a day or two.  After watching me read a few pages and put it down and then read a few more pages and put it down again, she asked why I hadn't finished already.  "To be honest," I said "it's just missing something and I can't seem to get into it."  Maybe it was the exhaustingly long email threads that attempted to hold chapters together or the never ending use of unrelated lists that seemd to do nothing more than fill space, but this book just didn't do it for me.  To be fair, I think I may have been comparing it too heavily to "Committed, Confessions of a Fantasy Football Junkie." by Mark St. Amant.  In my opinion, that book (released in 2004) truly captured the enjoyment, humor and obsession that I've experienced in so many fantasy football leagues.  "Why Fantasy Football Matters..." simply does not compare to that superior effort.  The book did make me laugh from time to time and a few passages did remind me of the leagues in which I participate.  I do not feel, however, that I can recommend it.  If you want to read an extremely well written tale that captures the humor and blinding obsession that surrounds fantasy football, pass by this title and grab a copy of "Committed..."  I've already started to reread it myself.   
 I never saw this movie until i was 16. The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie. The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way. But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies. I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now 
      "The best work of fiction to come out of the Vietnam War"?  "This is the way it was"?  Due to the tremendous reviews, I sought long and hard for this book.  I was truly disappointed.  I found the book hard to read and had to force  myself to finish the book. Fortunately, the latter part of the book dealing with the return home was more captivating.  There are many, many more worthwhile works of fiction on the Vietnam War.  I would not recommend this one.  Try James Webb's "Fields of Fire".  I also liked his post-war fiction "Lost Soldiers" 
 I have to contradict the other review.  I thought it was shot fine, but the sound was not good.  Moe is a two guitar band and I believe the strength of the band is the way the two guitar players play off each other.  On the DVD, Al is real loud, but Chuck's guitar is almost completely inaudible.  This is a real big disappointment to me.  I really like moe, but I would not recomend this DVD except for those who have to have it.  It's a real shame 
 I agree with others who've reviewed this title that the narrator, Steven, is very likable. He's upbeat, even when he's nervous or angry, which is a trait that separates him from other gay characters in many novels. Unfortunately, I found the situations he found himself in -- like dating 24 girls in one month, having a sexy schoolmate throw herself at him, and accidentally starting a new fashion craze at his school -- to be standard-issue sitcom material. Most situations end at the close of each chapter, just like at the end of a TV episode.   The story shows promise in the beginning when Steven describes his attraction to square-dancing: he likes that there is no confusion about what to do. That sentiment seemed so straightforward and heartfelt that I wanted to know more about it and see Steven enjoying it regularly. Instead, the square-dancing group becomes another situation for humor based on deception (a fellow dancer wants to fix Steven up with her grand-daughter and Steven must come up with an excuse not to meet her).  With other good novels covering the teenage coming out process with humor AND depth (like "Blackbird" by Larry Depluchan and "Eight Seconds" by Jean Ferris), I'm afraid I just can't recommend this one. 
 Hi there  Coming from an Oracle and SQL Server world, not alot changes really between the enterprise class DBMSs, many of the same best practice principals apply.  Unfortunatly, this book falls WELL short of the mark.  The book only glances over tuning, with no thorough look into the startup parameters for example.  Indexing, stats collection etc is also very poor and there are no discussions on internals (to save us all from reading the code!).    The replication chapter was OK, but I would seriosly suggest that the modelled replication model for load balancing is a really bad idea and a maintenance/cost nightmare.  For a prod dba from Oracle or SQL, you will be very disappointed 
 Artie may well be a baby gorilla, but the film sucks 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 Utter garbage.  When will the leftist stop regurgitating their tripe rhetoric 
 I bought this book soon after the death of my 11 year old daughter. I found the approach very uncomfortable and it left me feeling as though i was failing because i was not following the prescribed way of grieving. The examples given in the book led me to belive that if i did not follow the advice of the author i would be doomed to a life of sadness and despair. The most damaging aspect of the text was the insistance in "letting go", and idea i still find very difficult to accept. The freightening examples of people who had become overly interseted in the cause of a loved one's death only to fall victim to the sane illness would have been better placed in horror fiction. Stear clear, this book will help know one except the author 
 this is entertainment? Wow, exactly how much of your brain has been damaged by fat 
 I picked up this book expecting to gain some new insights about the bleeding edge of scientific research, string theory, and model-building, but found it unbelievably tedious, self-congratulatory, and self-absorbed. There may be little doubt that author Lisa Randall is a brilliant physicist, but her explanations of the last 100 years of science and her theories are muddled and poorly written. I found myself longing for a writer such as Bill Bryson to explain half of these theories. In addition, one of most annoying features of this book is the way Randall tries to disguise her inability to explain advanced physics in straightforward terms that would appeal to the lay reader by starting each chapter with a pop culture reference, usually a lyric from a band such as Metallica, as if such a reference will be enough to goose the reader awake and take interest in the next muddled exposition. She even has footnotes that explain the American term "runway" is translated as "catwalk" in the United Kingdom -- oh, thank you, Ms. Randall, for such elucidation! Why not make this book more interesting and readable with a more engaging style that explains these fascinating theories in a clearer manner? Not to give away the ending, but many of these theories about extra dimensions cannot even be proven unless the universe demonstrates another massive outburst of energy almost equivalent to the Big Bang 
 I wouldn't be surprised at all if people from Welcomed Consensus and their friends are beefing up reviews on their products.   I saw the other reviewer mentioning about the five star reviews and I did look into it and yes, it is the same reviewers and same five stars on all the videos made by this company.  I saw the video and I wasn't impressed.  I thought of returning it but it is a bit of a hassle and  Amazon has a limited partial refund policy within certain time period from purchase, although I would think if the video is so great that it would be the company Welcomed Consensus offering a money back guarantee even if it was purchased from Amazon as long as you have the video and receipt to prove it, but no such luck.  Other option is the dvd disc makes a good coaster for your coffee table be it an expensive one 
 I am usually enthralled by Maire Brennan's vocals. This time, I just can't get through the album without losing interest. She has several interesting, very beautiful solo albums.  "Perfect time" comes to mind as an example.  Get that one instead 
 I only wish I had not only the money back I spent on this book, but also the time I wasted reading it. A good book should inspire readers to think for themselves and form their own opinions on issues. All this book does is force feed the author's political leanings on the reader. Her spin on today's politics, in other words. Her view on today's issues is very naive and the story defies any sense of reality or belief. Don't waste your time or your money! 
 This book was prepared more for the Physics teachers at a university level than for average people who are expecting to get information they can work with. The information is strictly dealt with at a research level, and not at a practical level as the title intimates. The examples cited deal with many particles at a molecular and nano level, not very useful for the backyard scientist.Example ;vacuum polarization is, however, a relativistic effect involving electron positron pairs as the hole-theoretic interpretation assumes; a electrostatic field causes a redistribution of charge in the Dirac sea and thus polarizes the vacuum. Okay, so i'm dumb! Pau 
 Allan Ginsberg wrote in August 1972: "Some of Kerouac's writings of '52, particularly his Visions of Cody, are some of the most brilliant texts written about the psychedelic experience, especially the description of him and Neal Cassidy on Peyote." AND From October 26, 1974, Ginsberg writes of himself, which he learned from Kerouac: What I mean by "polish the mind," in that you actually do get an increasing awareness either through meditative or poetry which is another yoga, of the actual stuff, cita. And then it becomes a matter of being a very faithful secretary. You can't get everything, so you get as much as you can so you have something solid to work with. In other words, you're not doing something arbitrary, romantic, babble, bullsh*t, you're actually dealing with your mind stuff just like a painter's working with an actual landscape. Solid in the sense that it's real, it's objective, it isn't even your subjectivity any more, you're just objectively watching something move. So there's no long any question of egotism or self-expression or personal expression. All those theoretical things are like nonpracticing questions. But if you're actually practicing there's a real thing to work with, which is your thought-forms."  "Chogyam Trungpa's principle of "First thought, best thought." That was kerouac's basic principle for his spontaneous writing, for the same Buddhist reasons of practical inquiry into the operation of the mind. Both Kerouac and Trungpa realized, and teach, a very simple thing, which is that the first way that you flash on a thing is the unselfconscious, naked, real first-mind way, which is totally private and odd, eccentric to you, but is so direct that anybody can understand it."  At first, this book was way too muddled to be of much use for myself, not receiving much out of the book and feeling that I have invested way too much time for the read, but I think that's because I've been reading it as a novel like "On The Road," and this is more poetry or jazz style spontaneous prose. Actually, this book is from flashing mental thoughts that are suddenly inspired within the self. This book is not some preplanned novel and storyline and not at all the robotic, mechanical mindset of the propogandized America and therefore represents a breakthrough in American thinking, thinking for the autonomous self.   I think if this book were given the publisher to publish before "On The Road" they would have agreed here on such being garbled and overly Proustian in attempt of remembrance. However, to the person looking for poetry or verbal prose over a story, and in this we have a jazz type expression of bebop in words and that makes this book a major change from the herd mentality of the masses. Hey, this is the beat rhythmic language, not Melville or Dostoevsky, but Proust and Celine.  Now to be fair, there are some good descriptions and well written feelings through out the book, but not in volume. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a Beat Hipster I would like to think, a Nietzschian, a mystical, philosophical seeker into spiritual, psychedelic and karmic realms, but maybe not the existential, Benzedine type. This book is largely garbled ramblings?? Or is just too poetic for me? I can appreciate the long "bird" Parker-like jazz of the spontaneous sentence styles, the overly descriptive emphasis on observable flashes of insight, but this story has no story line, ok-it's poetry or electic prose. So it's verbal dynamics in avant garde, not a novel then, and I guess I'm failing to fully appreciate it.   When Kerouac gets Celine-ian he works very well, but when he enters his Proustian attempt at daily observations, he becomes cloudy in tangent ramblings of private memories, non-relating to his current observations that are over detailed and nonsensical in the first place. His dope-riddled conversations and past remembrances enter back doorways in winding pathways of the red neon lights.   Now Ginsberg's introduction to the book, that I found both enjoyable and very understandable. Allen Ginsberg in a November 26th 1968 interview, from the book, Spontaneous Mind, page 132, writes on Robert Creeley and Kerouac's style of writing:   "Creeley was talking about how his writing was determined by the typewriter, neurasthenias of his habit; mine is determined by the physical circumstances of writing, i.e., literally that. And I got that actually from Kerouac, who was that simple and straight about it. If he had a short notebook he wrote little ditties and if he had a long . . . a big typewriter page, he wrote big long sentences like Proust."  I think this agrees with Visions of Cody, in consisting of either short "ditties" or "long sentences like Proust," all depending on the writing pad Kerouac was using at the time of writing. To me this makes a whole lot of sense in the arbitrary, elusive and haphazard style of this book.  What appears to me as the Kerouac trademark: a jazz styled prose of spontaneous expression from the "real," non-conditioned, non-image-to-portray self, an existential life of despair in fast paced living with the rush of jazz, drink, sex, travel, under the literary and scholarly ideals of avant garde sophistication, adventure, desires, seeking new discoveries, walking places one never has been before, risk taking and traveling, all so under this empty void of utter lonely existence, devoid of substantial meanings of foundational holds and securities, walking in the desert not knowing when water will appear and if it does, if this water will sustain life or poison it. So there's this emptiness, this sadness of it all in the modern man and woman, both subterranean and beatnik.  Remember-able observances in my mind: Kerouac's staring up at a man in an apartment building watching and writing and suddenly the light goes off! He saw him!; a description of a church that failed all gothic tests into the modern brown brick suburban model of tackiness with the stupidest shrubbery to boot; Cody's (Cassidy's) hobo father walking the train tracks looking for a fix; Cody's pool hustling and challenged football playing from a jump out of the car, left on the side of the road. 
 Bennett makes few if any good points in this book about the problems our culture faces.  Most of the book is spent showing how many people were "critics" and how he showed them who was boss.  Bennett criticizes anyone who wishes to include diversity in the American life: through "controversial" art which he deems a "bad joke" simply because it may shock viewers, through a desire for schooling that does not impose Christian ideals upon its students by force, through courses that don't only include dead white men of the western world, etc.  Bennett's argument is that his racist, homophobic, beauraucratic, Christian-supremicist version of morality is the only feasible one and must be imposed upon all children in any institution of education.  He spends most of the book laughing off his critics and indignantly ignoring any of their points, casting them off as just being jealous that their plans aren't as good as his.  Yet he thinks vouchers will help poor students, that an abolishment of affirmative action will help minorities, and that "beheading" drug dealers is morally plausible.  The section on drugs has a little bit of insight, but the books few good points are obscured by his blatant arrogance and conservative ideals 
  The People of Sparks by Jeanne DuPrau is a horrible book that I would not recommend to people under the age of eleven. This story takes place in the city of Sparks. Lina & Doon have just lead the people of Ember out from underground. After coming to the city the Emberites are mistreated, malnourished, and misunderstood. So Lina goes out into the Empty Lands with a roamer that is looking for treasure. The Empty Lands are full of owls, coyotes, and other odd animals. There are also destroyed homes and buildings. Following this she comes back, and there is a large fight involving everybody. After that the climax is still climbing, and the most important part is ... I can't tell you!  	The above ground city of Sparks is an incredibly small city. The population is only three hundred twenty-seven and then to make matters worse, four hundred odd some people of Ember come to live with them. With food being scarce and people on the brink of war, Lina leaves with a roamer and goes to the Ancient City. This roamer that Lina left with is very rude, odd, and is looking for buried treasure that isn't there. When the roamer leaves, Lina leaves with the roamer's partner and head back to Sparks. When the two meet a new roamer, that is going to Sparks, they travel with him. The Roamer tells Lina the clues to the treasure, and Lina tells him that it is... I can't tell you, you have to read it.  	Truly, I thought the book was horrible, and weird because I don't like Fantasies, but if you like Fantasies you should read it 
 While the literary passages are well chosen and of considerable interest, the experienced gardener will find most of the so called "practical gardening ideas" mostly fluff, and sometimes inaccurate.   In short: a very good idea, poorly executed 
 This printer sucks! It started out working wonderfully. Then all of a sudden (after the third month in use) it started printing very slowly. Then it decided it wouldn't print at all unless I completely shut down my computer everytime. Something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge. It also uses the color ink when it's not requested. I only needed the color ink a couple of times (not for pictures) and it went just as fast as the black. I used to love hp. They are now making garbage. I'm thinking of looking at the OKI brand. Don't waste your money on this one 
 Slow, confusing, not very believable, (and to top it off Pink is beyond irritating).  I was very disappointed in this installment in the Irene Adler series.  As a long time fan I have been quite disappointed in the last two book 
 This book, tries to tell a narrative with an arrogant set of characters that don't blend well from one change to the next.  You spend the first half trying to figure out one redeeming quality about the main author and the point of the letters to one's love who seems to hate him, and then if you can make it to the end you are absolutely dissapointed.  I actually through the book down in disgust several times and only made myself pick it up because I've never not finished a book 
 Marvin Meyer has done a service for us in that he has translated the Coptic text of a document that helps to explain the beliefs of proto-Gnostic Greek mystery sects in the second century.  However, his introduction reveals his bias.  One must remember that the Gospel of Thomas is dated by reputable scholars as somewhere between 70-100 years younger (and therefore more unreliable) than the synoptic Gospels of the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke).  One must also remember, as Meyer describes, that the Gospel of Thomas survives in its entirety in only ONE full manuscript, and it is a translation of the missing Greek text into the unrelated Coptic language.  (We also have three Greek quotations of the text of the Gospel of Thomas in the writings of some early church fathers).  Compared to the thousands of partial and full ancient Greek manuscripts that we have available to us of the canonical gospels, the Gospel of Thomas cannot be seriously considered to be a more accurate account of the teaching of Jesus than the canonical gospels.  Meyer obviously favors the Gospel of Thomas over the canonical gospels, with some extremely faulty reasoning.  Meyer writes on pages 8-9 of the intro, "The most well-known Christian collection of sayings is what Burton Mack calls "the lost gospel" Q (from the German Quelle, "source"), which was used, along with Mark, by Matthew and Luke in the compilation of their gospels.  As it has been reconstructed out of sayings in Matthew and Luke, Q was very likely a "gospel" of wisdom very much like the Gospel of Thomas in it is literary genre."  In other words, Meyer likes to see Jesus as a teacher minus all the miracle stories present in the canonical gospels, which, in his mind, was who Jesus really was.  The Gospel of Thomas, with no miracle stories or crucifixion/resurrection narrative, obviously reveals a Jesus that Meyer prefers to the "Jesus of Faith." But relying upon Q to prove that Christ was not a supernatural miracle worker but only a wise teacher is unbelievably subjective.  Q is hypothetical, a theory, that's it.  There is no Q manuscript anywhere in existence.  Q very well may have existed as a source for Matthew, and Luke, but if it did, we have no sure idea what it contained.  Meyer talks as if he is quoting directly from Q, which allows him to come to whatever conclusion he wishes to reach.  If Q really consists of what is common to Matthew and Luke, it could just as well contain many miracles of Christ in addition to teaching alone.    It is far more likely that the Gospel of Thomas is the representation of a mixture of Greek philosophical Gnosticism and Christian belief.  Meyer himself admits on page 6 of the introduction that it is likely that the Gospel of Thomas was written by a Manichean, a group which Meyer describes as "mystical, gnostic followers of the teacher Mani."  The ancient church father Cyril of Jerusalem attributed the writing of the Gospel of Thomas to a Manichean, and scholars knew this long before the text of the Gospel of Thomas was ever even discovered in the 20th century 
 There is no question that the photography and the men photographed are beautiful...no, just plain damn hot.  However, the slow motion camera work coupled with a hypnotic soundtrack lull the viewer into sleep rather than into arousal.  If you want something pretty to look at, this might be up your alley.  If you are looking to come away excited, this probably isn't what you're looking for.  
 Now when I spotted this book, I thought it would actually be worth reading. Yeah, right. I hate Simon. I hate him with a passion. He was a lackluster character made by a ghetto character designer trying to sell the character for a rock. I did like 'Albino Chick' as I affectionately dubbed her who was a really good character unlike some people. Mainly because she acted like a real person. This author doesn't write in an interesting fashion and it's really really sad when you skip through all the parts just to find parts with 'Albino Chick.' The plot idea was okay but you'll probably fall asleep before you finish reading it 
 My wife an I saw this unit in a specialty store, thought is was pretty neat.  Then we purchased it on Amazon.  We like it for a number of reasons, it has a magnet that was handy for storing it on the bottom of our microwave oven, in reach for that quick launch of ground pepper.  However, we hadn't used it more than maybe 10 times and the handle broke off!  Now it is kaput!  Can't fix it, etc.  Piss poor quality control, but a nice idea!  
 I like reading.  I am a literature snob.  I put down poorly written novels (even though I can't write well myself!).  But, I think I've met my match in this novel.  I recognize the style is something unique, but I just couldn't grasp the rhythm.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with those who gave this book thumbs down.  I really want to be in the group that appreciates this Plitzer Prize novel, but I don't make the cut.        HOwever, I'd love to read more from reviewers on what they saw in this book because I just couldn't find much other than the rambling thoughts of a very whiny and boring 40-something man whom I would't enjoy spending a 3-day-weekend with at all.        I've persistantly struggled through 180 pages, but now will surrender!   
 The best contribution to the music world offered by this band is the hilarious song "Punky's Whips" by Frank Zappa, which is a fictional account of his then-drummer Terry Bozzio's [...] infatuation with Punky Meadows.  This band [...].    A lot 
 As a (once) big Jurassic 5 fan, I couldn't believe how terrible this album was.  The lyircs got old fast, the beats were boring and like another reviewer mentioned, I got sick of the whole "girl/getting over shyness" type of songs.  This album reminded me of a no-name group that wants to get big fast so their label puts a whole bunch of big name stars on the album to gain more fans and radio play...NOT what I would expect from a solid group like J5 at all!      Power in Numbers was just okay to me, and they totally lost me with this latest release; I will not be buying another J5 album from here on out.  It's no wonder Cut Chemist left the group.. 
 Was not impressed.  Narrow scoped, personal reflections, applications limited.  I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not impressed 
 The very Best of the DJ Tiesto REAL LIVE Show is the amazing synchronization  between the music and the show (lights, fireworks, etc.) This DVD is TOTALLY unsync; and doesn't make justice to the real thing. The real thing is just amazing. The DVD version is just BAD; VERY BAD. More than disappointed I hate the moment when I made my decision to bought this DVD. REALY BAD !! 
 I love Daniel Stell books but this one was horible.I have to admit I didn't finsh it but I got tired of how her husband treated her and she did nothing about it.But from what I've read from other readers I didn't miss much by not finshing it 
 I purchased this book 4-5 years ago, being really interested in the author's theory of "tracks". Dietmar Kramer has taken the Bach flower remedies and classified them into what he calls "tracks", e.g. centuary-holy-pine, where the centaury-associated inability to say no, if not treated, leads as compensation into a Holy state and then into a pine state as decompensation. Treatment follows the track, start with Pine and proceed with Holy and then Centaury.   The problem is that the classification of the remedies into tracks is arbitrary. Problems such as the ones that the Bach remedies seek to treat are not linear. A Pine state for instance does not necessarily have to result from something else and if it does, that something does not have to be holy or centaury. It could very well be related and/or caused by a dozen other states. This applies to all Bach flower "tracks".  Great care must be taken when proposing such theories 
 The movie wasn't even close to anything from the Arthurian legends, the plot was weak. The acting was good but it goes to show you that even superb actors can't overcome a fatally weak, cliche-driven script. What a waste of an opportunity to make a great movie.  The cliches begin with Malagant (Ben Cross) - a character manufactured by Hollywood who combines all that is evil, "wears black", slaughters the innocent for sport, etc.    Lancelot (Richard Gere) - an unbelievable man-of-the-1990's character foils the evil Malagant, marries Guinevere (Julia Ormond), now Arthur's (Sean Connory) widow and they live happily ever after.  If this appeals to you, RENT the movie. I can't imagine you'd ever want to buy it for your personal library unless you are teaching the History of Bad Movies.  Hey Amazon, you need a "half a star" rating for situations just such as this.    
 I took the bait and bought this book.  It's jammed packed with information that can be obtained from most any phone book.  The oddest book I've ever bought and I have quite a collection.  If you need a big book for a child to sit on or to prop a door open, go ahead.  If you're looking for useful information, call your county extension agency or local groups.  This one's a waste of paper and ink. 
 Please don't waste your hard earned money on this awful toy. It is tiny! The "hinges" and lock had worn marks on the plastic even before opening the product so you know they will break off soon. The "jewels" never sink, either.  Interestingly, PoolToy doesn't list the size of this product. In fact they don't give much information at all which is very misleading and disappointing. What a rip off. I hope Amazon discontinues its association with this company. Look at the feedback record for them. It's as terrible as this toy is 
    We received a rather terse note on returning from our vacation   about not emailing a response back. The book was in HORRIBLE shape. His description of the 'worn ' appearance was wishful thinking. He did not email us and tell us that a credit had been issued . I found that out by followup. I can't say the 'near'service we received was very good 
 I bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen.  That was a bad decision.  After having received two issues, I continue to be disappointed.  The quality of the art & design, and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky. I would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine.  
 This was my second attempt to find a successful Laymon novel.  After all, with his list of A-list writer's recommendations at the front of the book, you'd think we'd have something decent once in a while.  You would think wrong.  My first complaint is the excessive use of the word "rump."  Laymon uses it over 15 times throughout this novel as if he's scared to use a common synonym.  This wouldnt be a problem, but the novel is filled with every other bad word imaginable and "rump" just sticks out.  Not to mention that there are scenes of intense rape, murder, and gore, and he still uses "rump."  It sticks out.  I think Laymon had a checklist for weapons in this book.  Every character shows up with something different:  a gasoline pump, a bike pump, whatever.  Wouldnt most people use a knife or a gun?  He shows us the crazies have intelligence and their normal psyche, but still some opt for a spear other than a knife.  Who has a spear hanging around?  Bad dialogue.  Lame ending.  The list goes on and on.  No matter how awesome the premise on the back of a Laymon novel sounds (and they do SOUND awesome), I wont toss away seven or eight bucks again on him.  Read the King instead 
 Whoa...this parfum was way too strong for my taste.  I'm wondering if I was even sent the wrong product.  I read the rave Amazon reviews and I thought the price was reasonable, so I thought I would give it a try.  This parfum smelled so strong and loud, I gave it to my boyfriend!  I hated it...I prefer light fresh or sweet floral smells, and this parfum smelled heavy and musky, even masculine.  One spritz is enough.  Two is overkill.   I personally wouldn't recommend it, to a woman or man 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 This book was a complete waste of money.  It was so boring and really had nothing exciting in it.  The only reason I actually finished the book was because I paid over $25 for it and I felt I had to finish it because of the high cost.  You are really paying for the art.  Please don't buy this book if you think you are going to get an interesting story.  
 I wasn't sure what I'd get but it turns out to be basicly an overpriced noteboo 
 There is so much more to the imaginary London than the author conveys.  This book feels like it was dictated to complete an assignment.  Buy the Ackroyd book, London: A Biography instead...and then use your own imagination.  I agree with previous reviewers who called it superficial with the real book still waiting for an author to write it 
 There are much better books on management out there than this collection of unorganized work.  Don't read this book if you're looking for new insight on management techniques.  If you're already a seasoned manager, you'll find more value in your real work environment.  This was a text for one of my MBA courses, and the rest of my MBA team (which consists of seasoned management professionals) has the same sentiments.  Spend your time elsewhere. 
 On LP and recently purchased it on CD only to realise why I don't listen to it its Flat. Don't get me wrong I love Dylans music, he is the only musician whose's concert I went to In good old Sydney in 1977 I think. His singing is as good as any the notes are clear but is it missing that range of feeling and expression that he can produce. He is putting his soul into the album instead of giving to the audience. Slow Train Coming and The Times They Are a Changing, are my all time favourite albums. 
 This would have been a nice phone set, but the reception was awful! I got static sound no matter where I was in relation to the base and no matter where I put the base in the house.  The manual said to place it away from electrical objects such as microwaves and tv's. First of all, it is hard to do that nowadays. Second, I did try to move the base and little units around, but I got no change in reception quality.  Otherwise, this would have been a really great phone 
 I`m trying to remember what made me pick up this book. I know I wanted some light reading for the summer days sitting on the beach but the Face was so bad it took me a month to finish it. I literally had to force myself to read it. The writing is vintage Koontz to the extreme. Koontz likes to describe things that not many people really care about and this book is yet another example. I call it diarrhea.(Spell check)  I respect Koontz, for example, Odd Thomas is really good but the face is a story of a boy who is the target of a sick, demented killer. Thanks to some spirit who led a disgraceful life while alive, the boy lives in the end.   A good 200 pages could have been deleted from this book and maybe then we would have had something decent. My advice is skip this one.   I would love to know if Mr. Koontz is being paid by the page? The face makes me wonder.. 
 There are some figures of the Civil War that it is very easy to hate. Even today, very few Civil War buffs have anything good to say about Braxton Bragg or Henry Halleck for example. While not as well known as Bragg or Halleck, there is much to distain in the life of Hugh Judson Kilpatrick, a Union cavalry commander from New Jersey. Samuel J. Martin provides more than enough dirt on Kilpatrick's rather sordid personal life and less than honorable character. Kilpatrick was a selfish and vain man whose ambition for power and glory led him to act rashly and often foolishly while covering his mistakes in the press and reports to his superiors. Furthermore, Kilpatrick was a womanizer who had no qualms about cheating on his wife and discarding mistresses, even those who he impregnated. Martin certainly proves that General Kilpatrick was a scoundrel.   Martin leads the reader through Kilpatrick's rather checkered Civil War career. Graduating from West Point in 1861, Kilpatrick served with the New York volunteers and became known for his rash charges and his willingness to fight. Martin seems to accept this reputation but seems to argue that Kilpatrick was a physical coward, a rather odd statement considering the general's willingness to fight on the battlefield or off (even calling out Southern cadets at West Point to fist fights). Kilpatrick won some fame for driving his men to within 2 miles of Richmond as part of the Stoneman Raid during the Chancelorsville campaign and became a general in the summer of 1863. While part of his division won laurels at Gettysburg (Custer's brigade), the Kilpatrick ordered charge on July 3 proved to be an error, costing the lives of many men of Farnwsorth's brigade including Farnsworth himself. Kilpatrick would lead another raid on Richmond in early 1864, hoping to free a number of Union prisoners, pass out Lincoln's amnesty proclomation and capture and perhaps kill key Confederate leaders including Jefferson Davis and his cabinet. Martin agrees with the Stephen Sears that Kilpatrick was in charge of the raid though a recent article by David Long (which he is turning into a book) argues that Dahlgren planned to kill Davis and that Kilpatrick, a notorious leaker to the press, was out of the loop. After the failure of the raid, Kilpatrick was sent west and led Union cavalry for Sherman's march to the sea and Carolina campaigns.   After the war, Kilpatrick, who in the war expressed presidential ambitions, made two failed efforts to get the Republican gubenatorial nomination in New Jersey, ran unsuccessfully for the House of Represenatives in 1880 and twice served as ambasador to Chile. He passed way in 1881 in Chile at the age of 45. While a Republican, he was recalled from Chile by Grant which led to his supporting Horace Greely in 1872. Kilpatrick returned to the GOP and supported Hayes in 1876 and Garfield in 1880.  Martin certainly reveals Kilpatrick's dismal character and offers a solid, if often overly critical, account of his military career. In all fairness Martin had little to work with as Kilpatrick's papers were destroyed. Still, Kilpatrick's political career could have been examined in greater detail. For all his faults, Kilpatrick had an energy and ambition to him which made him a fairly represenative figure for his times. One is left wondering, after reading Martin's book, why Kilpatrick simply was not shelved. Kilpatrick, again with all his baggage, was a fighter and those were few and far between in the Union ranks. His ambition forced him to the battlefield and took him into politics. While Martin reveals the dark side to this ambition, Kilpatrick rose out of youthful obscurity to win a solid reputation. He could not have been merely the talentless scoundrel that Martin depicts. While Martin seems to rely a great deal on secondary sources, he really had no other choice. Despite that, one suspects that Martin went into writing the book with his thesis already formulated and that is what proves frustrating about this book. Martin should have given the reader a portrait of Kilpatrick in full as opposed to bashing us over the head with how much of a jerk the man was.     
 This is a "sweet" book that is very reassuring  and interesting to read if you don't have anything better to do.   But as a mom, who has time for this?   Don't we all look up things in a state of diress, hoping to find concrete useful information delivered rapidly in the least words possible? Well, you won't find that here.   This book is full of very nonspecific, sometimes outdated information delivered in a very wordy style. The whole book is written in long paragraphs.  There are very few tables or charts.  IT's VERY wordy.   Just to give you an example, I looked up Fluoride supplementation. It addresses the topic using nearly a FULL page, but never tells you the actual amount your baby should have depending on his age! More concise and concrete information is available in pediatrician Dr. Ari Brown's "Baby 411"!  I gave this book one star because aside from being too general, some of the information in it is outdated, or in the category of "old wives tales" ! Save your money and skip the "what to expect" book 
 I knew after 1983 things would never be the same with Rock and Roll ever again. The music was becoming more clean sounding with technology more or less replacing the majority of musicians. This would be one of the first ones. I remember hearing the first single from this which was "Little Red Corvette" I still say probably one of Prince's best songs, and the only other tune that's passible is "Let's Pretend We're Married". Everything else is horrible. The title track to me is a mindless, brainless dance tune, and I feel has no inadmissable value to life. Unfortunately, I guess the only way to get girls is to like this song. I also didn't take too much fancy to the other hit which was "Delirious". I am somewhat disappointed with this as to me Prince is a gifted performer, and plays a decent guitar, so why go technical? I just am appalled at the way music wound up, and it all started here 
 When I read the original "5 languages of love" 3 years ago, it changed the way I related to the important people in my life. I also learned how to ask others to show their love in a way I could understand. So, when I saw that Chapman had written a book for singles, I ordered it immediately. I couldn't be more disappointed. While the original book presented sound and common-sense psychological research and insights, the newer "singles" book has devolved into far-right Christian dogma. While the original book was 'descriptive', telling one how to show love in a way one's mate could understand, the new book is 'prescriptive', demanding that one have "wholesome" relationships according to ultra-conservative Christian sensibility. The section on "loving touch" repeats over and over that sexuality is to be expressed only within the bounds of marriage, a view that won't help the majority of possible readers. Even if you're single, skip this disappointing book and find the original in a used bookstore 
 Horrible book.  The racist continues his trend of substandard writing 
 A few good ideas that could have been a good chapter in another book 
 DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. this book promotes eating disorders, plain and simple. i'm a dancer, and i have always been thin, but the "suggestions" this book gives are absurd. dancers are very conscious of their bodies, compare themselves to other dancers and hold themselves up to high standards. this book pretty much says that a dancer who is 5'3" should be 94 pounds. this is so messed up. the book suggests a diet of 1200 calories a day. look at the titles: "why a dancer should diet: you can't hide anything in tights" and "the chain around the refrigerator." it shows a dancer ready to "feast" on garden products. besides that, this book was written in 1984. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 I liked this book in the end but it took me awhile to warm up to the two people in the story.  The girl was a bit of a witch at times and the guy could be a real jerk.  I thought she was kind of pushy and demanding.  He was kind of shallow.  But by the end, I did start to warm to them, but he did still continue to be a jerk.  I think it was an ok book to read, but in the end I never fully came to like either one of them.  I have read better chicklit 
 I am so disappointed in this book, I am returning it. My primary reason? The authors keep mentioning 100 trigger foods that the ALCAT tests for, yet they never provide this list. Why not? Because this book is simply a marketing vehicle to get people to order the test through their lab. 
 Don't buy it. Get a book from wrox or sun 
 I enjoy reading food narratives and childhood accounts of growing up in foreign countries; however, this book is quite a disappointment after reading the summary above.  The writing isn't great, the descriptions certainly don't transport you to Tuscany, and despite the title, I wouldn't say there is an emphasis on food.  If you were related to Patrizia, you mind find it an interesting read, but I've found myself skimming through it, searching for compelling passages, of which there are few 
 I am a professional pet stylist, and when I saw this book advertised in one of the Groomer magazines, I immediately went to Amazon to purchase it.  I was excited to see that someone had actually written a book addressing the issues of grooming "mixed" breeds, a.k.a. Mutts.  Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed.  This book provides no real information.  The author uses drawings of dogs she has groomed in the past.  These drawings are only a 'side' view, and no drawing of the all important head is included.  I am giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 only because the author, at least, attempted to write a book about mutts.  The author simply suggests that you, as a groomer, determine what pure breeds the mutt resembles, and then groom accordingly.  I can tell you that in my shop, I see many mutts that are impossible to determine their lineage.  I was hoping this book detailed the different requirements of grooming a mutt, such as providing details of creating a "Teddy Bear" head on a Shih Tzu, or how to set up a "mane" when doing a strip on an Alaskan Husky.  The book is short on details, and actually gave me NO new information or tips that are not readily available in any one of dozens of pure bred grooming books.  I cannot recommend this book to professional groomers as there is no detail and the drawings are sadly lacking.  I certainly would not recommend this book to the grooming "do-it-yourselfer" as there is no information concerning the basics of grooming such as proper bathing and brushing, etc.  Don't experience the buyers remorse I am experiencing.  I absolutely do NOT RECOMMEND buying this book 
 I'm struggling through Shadow of the Giant. Normally when I read a book, I read the entire thing in as close to one sitting as possible. Giant is taking me a while - a chapter at a time, and I'm only halfway through after several months, and have no particular motivation to pick it up at any given point in time.   It reads like a plot outline, not a novel. Nearly every scene is "tell" and not "show." The characters are plot devices instead of real people. It just doesn't pull me in the way Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, and Ender's Shadow did. It's like reading through a textbook. "This happened, and this person did this, and that person did that, and here's why." With occasional bits of dialogue thrown in here and there that didn't necessarily show off the most important parts of the scene.  I don't think this should have been published as-is. It's a draft, not a finished novel. And considering just how long the draft was, when almost all of the scenes - written out properly - could've been 3-5 times their present lengths, this could've either been the outline for multiple books, or it needed a lot of pruning 
 Jean Markale is notorious around the Celtic Studies community for all of the historical inaccuracies and seemingly 'historical inventions' present in these books.  I recommend instead that you look into "the Celts" by Barry Cunliffe or anything by Peter Bressford Ellis 
     I was very disapointed with the smoker cover.  It is made of a very THIN plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material.  This type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat, weather, and also some general scratching.  Just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it.  The company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable.      Sincerely yours,  Allen Vest III 
 As an avid collector of David Austin books and roses, I was very displeased with this over priced book. It's pretty much his older books just rehashed with a few more added roses. The quality of the photographs are not very impressive. The book just seems to photograph each rose by itself as opposed to a full bush. I was hoping for a lot better quality for the price I paid for this book. 
 If you are expecting the Disney's Mary Poppins, you are best making another reading selection.  Unfortunately, my expectations may have tainted my reading experience.  The book is filled with fun imaginative adventures children would enjoy.  However, Mary Poppins is stern and hard.  Her tightly guarded compassionate side does pop up during different events, but overall she treats the Bank's children with a harsh and sometimes demeaning hand 
 I like some of the other Walden Farms products -- I gave their chocolate dip 4 stars -- but this one is not very good. I tried dipping different kinds of fruit into it, tried it in combination with the chocolate dip, and finally gave up and threw the rest of it away. The cellulose gel Walden Farms uses to give its sauces body seems to have a slight spicy/sour "bite" to it; it doesn't bother me in the chocolate dip or in most of their dressings, but here it ruins the flavor 
 One assumes that Goff intended this travesty of a book to provide a history of white gospel singing.  But, while constantly referring to white and black gospel as distinctive forms, he never establishes exactly what the differences are.  He instead pelts readers with a flurry of boring mini-biographies and social-conservative propaganda.  The reader gets a strong sense that Goff disapproves of atheists, homosexuality and abortion, but if the book was supposed to give a definitive account of a musical tradition, it fails 
 This book was recommended for me to read by my husband's personal therapist.  He's in anger counseling, after coming back from Iraq, and I'm the one reading about six books right now.  While it was worth the read, I need MORE:  More instruction, more direction.  More getting to the point!  Lerner goes on and on and I found myself bored with the stories.  I'm reading for answers.  There are so many stories and you really have to hunt for clues as to WHAT TO DO IN YOUR OWN LIFE.  If you're reading a self-help book, then obviously you just may need some help now.  And fishing for "what to do" isn't productive.  I just didn't like the flowy, story telling way of writing.  To me, she spent a lot of time writing the history of a problematic relationship and then what the patient WANTED to achieve and then not so much as to what was needed to fix the problem for a positive outcome.  Too many times I read the phrase, "we'll get to that later."  
 Boring, moronic and a complete waste of the talents of Jason Isaacs - save your money.  
 It's taken me a while to get through this book partly because I'm not very excited about the plot and partly because the author's self-conscious writing style really annoys me. There are lovely phrases here and there, but there are plenty of others that read like something you'd find in a greeting card--they try hard to impress and fail. The author makes deliberate, almost constant use of foreshadowing, perhaps in an attempt to get the reader to stick with the book and not lay it down for good. I'm contemplating the latter 
 I love this book until I came across a part where Mary Anne talks to Dawn about her parents' divorce. MA said "So what if your parents are divorced? There's nothing WRONG with it." I was furious! YES there is something wrong with it! Divorce is against God's law, and I feel extremely strong about this. I cannot believe the message Ann M. Martin is sending to readers!  
 I can't believe this was a Lifetime movie.It does make us wonder about Linda Hamilton's post-Terminator career choices.She's no Sarah Connor,future mother of mankind's savior,but a mousy journalist investigating Jacqueline Bisset,who may or may not be a madam.Linda Hamilton seems to be discomfitted in this movie,and with its awful script,it's no wonder why.  Jacqueline Bisset plays a Frenchwoman who combines the Professor from "My Fair Lady" with the campiness of Mame.She's being campy&clearly enjoying it.  Linda Hamilton is "transformed" from being an ugly American to an erotic Mademoiselle through buying lingerie,having a loooong dressing room sequence&watching pornos.Having a fling with a hot photographer apparently perks her up too.  This movie makes good for early morning watching (say 4 am,before going to work?),and it makes for good campy fun.If you're having a Bad Movie Night,put this on your list,have some French rose wine&chow down on chocolate croissants!  "Sex&Mrs.X" is hardly an epic,but it's a PERFECT GUILTY PLEASURE 
 not a great movie... someone made a comment in these reviews about.."Have you ever screwed up unintentionally in a relationship?".. and all i can think is please, the guy in this movie goes out with another girl cause he wants to sleep with her, even tho he doesnt want to admit it to himself, but he does admit it to his friend... he knew what he was doing when he went out with that other girl, it wasnt unintentional, he was a jerk, and he deserved what she put him thru, i found the main actress very funny, and i dont understand why she wanted this jerk back, wont she keep wondering if hes straying? its kinda sad, if a guy with a g/f that pretty strays, what hope is there? i suppose not all guys are jerks...  this movie was a rollercoaster, shes showing his whos boss, and he shows her they make eachother jealous, blah blah blah.. 
 I bought this thinking it would be a kind of sports watch - for swimming and running.  Unfortunately it is not waterproof for swimming, is unbelievably bulky, and has this strange time setting system which only works in the USA and Europe (I live in Australia). In the end I gave it to a relative in the USA 
 Do You Love the police?   the best performance revolutionary reggae pop rock of the 80's?  ME TOO!   this CD is a must have for the die hard police fans out there,  just for the awsome cover art.  other than that... ehh.   its not amazing... and if you don't like the police then you will kick yourself for buying this album.  So i'f you like police then get it; otherwise,  go to the related item link on this site and click on like syncronicity or Reggata de blanc...  those are more rewarding.  ohh, and canary in a coal mine...Dawg Munn 
 I forced myself to finish this book. Like other reviewers have said, the characters are very one-dimensional and contrived. I can see Ms. Berg thinking, "Let's see, I need a character/patient who is rich, one who lives in the ghetto, how about an elderly Jewish couple...." etc. etc. If I read one more cliched remark from the character DeWitt I was going to scream!! I doubt I'll read another one of Berg's books. This one won't stay on my shelf for a second read down the road...off it goes to Goodwill. 
 Although my nursing school required this book, it is the most confusing and least helpful of all the 9 books I have on care planning and nursing diagnoses. I haven't met anyone who likes this book or finds it user friendly. In all the other books the rationales are written right after the interventions,this book does not use that format making it time consuming and frustrating. The book is unorganized and hard to follow. If this is not a required book,save your money for your tuition. 
 This book was written for people who truly have no clue how to act in any kind of professional setting.  I was already aware that I should not use "quick and dirty" or "snafu" in a professional environment.  It was a waste of money 
 I love this technique of making socks, but my advice is to go to a local yarn shop and ask about lessons rather than buy this book. This books is NOT for the visual learner. The photos (just two pages) do not illustrate the process and are poor quality.   One page is helpful and that is how to adapt any traditional sock pattern into this technique. Save your money and purchase yarn 
 The book makes a great argument, albeit unintented, on the ill effects of immigration on second and third generation ethnic Americans (yes, some insist on this "ethnic" fantasy). If your field is Sociology or Anthropology, you may find this book informative with respect to the self-mutilatory social  practices of those Americans who do not feel fully accepted. 
  I'm a big fan of Shogun (4 1/2 stars) and Tai-Pan (4 stars) and expected much of the same here.  But after 450 pages I gave up.  Plot, subplot, sub-subplot, sub-sub-subplot, scores of characters.  I got tired of starting another chapter with a new plot angle, when I was ready for development and resolution of what came before.  This book picks up with the Straun/Brock rivalry from Tai-Pan after an interval of 120 years.  I wanted that history filled-in (including the remaining three coins), but there was little of that in what I read.   The writing is still good and I may have been impatient to quit after only a third of the book, but I had to move on to something more satisfying 
 I am not by any means a squeamish person. In my relatively brief tenure on this planet, I've seen first-hand a great many things the 'average' individual might deem repulsive, repellent, unsavory, unseemly. Finally purchased this book ( a first-edition, no less ) at an independent record store, owing primarily to it's hipster cred as 'the' book to own for those in-the-know. While there is very little in this title that was a complete surprise to me ( in my varying lines of employment, I discovered early on that the human animal's capacity for cruelty and attendent perversion is virtually limitless ), to have all the various pecadilloes ( and their sub-genres ) represented between the pages of a single book that could be carried around as easily as the latest Tom Clancey crapfest was something akin to discovering that you possessed a vial containing every known social disease, and a few that were as-yet unclassified - good to know, but do you really want this thing lying around your house? In my case, no. Interesting book, I 'get' the point ( the human race is bipedal ape scum, and we're all going to hell in a handbasket ), but this is the first time I have ever felt moved to drop a book in the trash, and I am a compulsive book-buyer/reader, with literally thousands of titles lining the shelves. Just not this one. Not anymore.  
 If you are used to watching BTB of the BBC 1998 series you will be extremely disappointed. Bob and his gang's voice have changed & so is their favorite line to 'can we dig it'. There should be options for English,American English & others 
 I bought an Airplay2 from am Apple store for around $60. Other than the fact that "blank" FM stations are hard to find in the New York Metropolitan area, and that you need to keep changing to different "blank" stations as you drive, the product itself is simply terrible. Even if you are in a parking lot, and find a "blank" FM station, the quality of the music the Airplay broadcasts is very bad. The bass is almost non-existent, and there is a constant hiss in the background that you cannot get rid of. This product is not worth buying, especially for $60 
 Irving is one of my top favorite authors...but I was SO disappointed in "Until I Find You." I could not relate to any of the characters. I thought they were all miserable and just plain pathetic. I held out until about page 600 until I gave up and put the book down. I didn't even care to know what happened to the main character, Jack, at the end.   Jack's mother is a tattoo artist. The book goes into heavy detail about tattooing, which I found totally unnecessary and frankly, a distraction from an already convoluted plot. In fact, three quarters of the way through the book I still couldn't figure out what exactly we were supposed to care about with this plot.   Was the whole point that that people are misguided, confused and damaged? Who knows. The characters were just so annoying and unlikeable that I found it to be a real chore to read this book.   Read ANY of Irving's other books before this one. 
 I hated her column in Shape but I was having a fat moment and decided to read her book anyway and man, oh, man, it blew. What a whiny drama queen!  All she does is blame and refuse to take any responsibility for the fact that her weight loss project sh^t the bed becasue she has no control over her eating. Wah. Po' Coutney. Have another Jumbo muffin 
 The cover is very pretty thanks to Penguin books.  BUT..  this translation is seriously lacking in elegance.  Trust me.  Look into buying Robert Fitzgerald's tranlation or my personal favorite -Samuel Butler's tranlation.  They are far more poetic and descriptive than Robert Fagle.  I recommend picking up two translations and comparing the same few pages from the same chapters.  I honestly don't know why Robert Fagle got such high praise for this.  Take my advice and get Samuel Butler or Robert Fitzgerald's translation.   
 The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter.  The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty.  The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them.  I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups.  The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title "hero," would you still rate it highly?  If your answer is "yes," then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid.  Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar.  Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash.   I'm not counting on that, though 
 I really wanted this book to be good. It had the right setting: Ireland. The right pairing: a skillful, self-confident woman and a tormented man, who is a writer (very interesting to me as that's my profession.) It also seemed to have the right author: Nora Roberts. But these three things didn't gel for me. I was bored by the third chapter and ended up skimming the rest of the book. Brianna's character doesn't hold interest, Grayson is just plain annoying (I would have kicked him back out into the rain) and not romantic at all. None of the romantic spark and unique nature of Ireland comes through in this book. When Nora Roberts is on, she's really on. When she's off, you get "Born in Ice.&quot 
 I ordered Teriyaki, Original and Black pepper flavored ones.  The other two flovors are quite good but this one, teriyaki, is really sub-standard.  It has sandy texture and quality is very uneven compared to the others.  
 This book starts of interesting however the book goes on and on and on about scenarios involving people over the phone,it rarely mentions person to person or online scams.  The book suggested solutions to preventing social engineering attacks is really poor,I enjoyed the book for a few days but its really same old all the way through,many of the stories read like Hack Philes you can find on the net,full of lies and waffle.  You will find your self bored of the book,there are plenty of copies of it on e-bay for a reason,buy it for sentiment only and because its black.  I can't believe its by Mitnic 
 There appears to be a good many who support this book, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. personally i don't see why it's so fantastic. the suspension of fixed parameters and a "realistic" framework in general seems to be an easy way to avoid the more prosaic elements and ensuing entanglements in life, and may also be construed as a rather cheap method to beguile readers into a seeming style and artistry 
 This is the first Gann book I ever read. I expected it to be some kind of trading book that taught me about how one of the most famous traders of the last century developed and applied his technique like the Gann Line in the market, or something close to Reminiscences of a Stock Operator. However, this is a fiction of how somebody picking sentences here and there from the Bible, making propheses and earning bucks of gold in  commodities markets.    I have been a Baptist for half of my life and I study Bible intensely. I certainly would appreciate other traders to turn to Christ as their personal Savior. I just dont buy into that "Bible Code" type of stuff and take the Bible as a means of fortune telling for money making.   Still I will read other Gann books in the future. However, I just cant recommend this as a trading book to anyone at all 
 This book tries to asses Islamic identity to non believers and tries to show the relations between Islam and Secularism which are not exist in either. To me, some truths have been modified to fit into a category. I do not think this book worth of buying for 50 bucks 
 I got this net and set it up in February and been using it fairly regularly. I was hitting some balls tonight and noticed some tears in the netting much to my disappointment!   Shouldn't a $100.00 golf net last longer than 3-4 months?  Completely unacceptable 
 I really wanted to like this.  I read all the glowing reviews, am familiar with the artist's early work and was expecting it to be a good listen at least.  It went from bad to worse.  The tempo was all the same and I found myself waiting for it to be over.  There was not a single song I wished to hear again.  I could not recommend it 
 I had to have this book for a class I took. I found it difficult to track. If you must buy it, look for it used 
 It's been a few months since I read this, but I thought I might give a review.  I found this book horrid. It was not organized in a way that would be simple and easy for a reader. As a writer of historical fiction I was interested in finding out about daily life during the Civil War. But I would find references from all years thrown together so I had to fish out the important details.It was not broken down by years or decades which I think would have been much easier. I gave up on this book because I couldn't find the information I needed.  If you are a writer and are thinking about this book I suggest getting it from the library, and if you believe it will be of use to you buy it then. 
 I have nothing more to say than I've already said in my headline. Lou Dobbs' book was a big disappointment for me.  
 I cannot believe this is the same person who wrote that fantastic book, Absolute Power.  David, what happened????  The story is very fascinating but the characters were not.  I found myself rooting for the villian who is definitely a very bad person.  But our herione, LuAnn, is not believable.  He has her as a backward hick who does not have a social security number on one hand and then he has her acting like a genius on the other hand.  There were just too many up and downs for me.  I am sure the next book will be back on track 
 while I appreciate what Tipler was attempting to accomplish, he fails miserabley both from a theological and a scientific perspective.  skip this one! 
 I appreciate that this book has a listing of all of the obscure desserts from the last thirty years.  However some of them should have been lost.  Some of the directions are quite detailed on plate presentation but vague when it comes to the execution of the item.  My other pet with this book is the lack of consistency in portion size.  But can someone tell me what is the deal with the pigs?  For the professional borrow someonelse's, for the novice walk away, for the scientist; good luck cause not all of the recipes have worked.  A Professional Pastry Chef and staff 
 I read this book, and I must say, it seems that the only thing she likes is Pantene, and other like products. On every other page there is a reference to a product, but how Pantene is better. Are you kidding me!!!! Yuck! I think she seriously got paid off on this one. Cover to cover advertisements for a damaging horrrible product 
 This book only lists a few hotels per town and lonely planet lists as many as possible.  The pullout map is a joke, it only shows the bigger towns, and there aren't any good maps inside the book.  Lonely planet may not be as new, but still has twice the info this book has.   
 In 5th grade my reading group was assigned this book. We all hated it because Gilly was an obnoxious, snotty brat. We spent most of our work time drawing comics in which she crawled out of the school toilets and attacked us, and we had to fight back and defeat the evil Gilly. So if you want your kids to waste time, buy this book; if you actually want them to read something meaningful and enjoyable, look elsewhere.  However, I do have to say that we weren't at all shocked or corrupted by the language. Kids learn that stuff anyway 
 Despite the presence of some mighty fine dance singles from the past year ( I'm still grooving to "All This Time" in particular )this has got to be one of the absolute worst mixing jobs I have ever heard. Technically and artistically this mix is a total hatchet job, with nary a smooth trasition to be found or any real sense of flow 
 I'm on my 3rd v-180 in less than a year and every one of them has had a fatal flaw that caused me to return it (under warranty) for another.  Unfortunately, they have the option of sending you a refurbished model, which means that they tried to fix someone else's problem phone and pawn it off on you. This one is going to get flushed as soon as I find another phone to buy, since Cingular says it's now out of warranty and I'm not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months 
 This is the classic example of how a band can shove anything down impressionable youths' throats if they pretend to know what they're talking about and make it sound "revolutionary".  These songs are hate songs.  Offspring went from being fake hardcore poseur punk to what is now a band for meatheaded fratboy jocks and all their girlfiends who wear their varsity football jackets.  Oi vay 
 I bought the Zune around Christmas time of 2006. I used it on a daily basis and was happy with it. Early in April, it stopped working. After spending three (3) hours on the phone with four (4) technicians, Microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility. Two (2) weeks later, I received the Zune back with a note that the Zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations. They did not tell me what the problem was - only that they did not fix it. I was more then dismayed. I had spent almost $300.00 with tax and shipping to buy this product. I did not abuse it in any way. Please think twice before buying this product. If and when it breaks - Microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a $300.00 paperweight. 
 Ill give it 2 stars instead of 1. because it is not nietzsche i have the prolem with.  I knew i was taking a chance by buying this, I like Hollingdale, and like kaufman, but this translater, takes the fun out of freddie. It hardly even sounds like nietzsche speaking.  For one example a famous line is "we all speak vaugly about poerty because we are all bad poets.".. When i read that line i barely realized i read it as he write "we all speak abrtractly about our poetry because we tend to be indifferent poets."  The whole book reads like that. Nietzsche Bold statements! poetic prose are replaced with boring textbook like translation.  I realized we might have a problem when i read the "ABOUT THE AUTHOR" in the book and he had traslated the title of "THE GAY SCIENCE" to "THE JOYFUL KNOWING" uhm.... I'm re-buying the book today the kaufman version. dont buy this 
 As indignity upon indignity is heaped on our protagonist, one gets a distinct whiff of self-loathing if not actual homophobia in this depiction of a young gay man's exploitation in the big city. Mandragora is way too long, relentlessly bleak and only has a couple of novel cinematic tricks to spark a bit of interest 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 Bottom Line: Fans of A Series of Unfortunate Events will most likely be disappointed by this book.  "The End" does for series what the movie did for the franchise; and that's not good.  Before I get into the negatives, first let me state the positives.  While not as good as in earlier books, the writing in "The End" is clever and still has the trademark Snicket whit and wordplay, although the jokes seem forced and repetitive - but I guess it all depends on how you look at it.  Also, the final revelation in Chapter 14 (yes, there is an additional chapter at the end of the book) gives careful readers a lot to ponder.  As with all the other books in the series, this is a fun and fast read and, even though there are major problems, I must admit that I still had a good time reading this book.  That's about it for the positives.  Now for the downside.  First off, you will not find resolution to many of the series' mysteries in "The End": No information on the contents or location of the sugar bowl, nothing more about the purpose of VFD or its schism, nothing about the fates of the villains and volunteers from the fire at the Hotel Denouement (or the hidden library), not a word about the "man with a beard but no hair" and the "woman with hair but no beard," not a peep about the possible survival of one of the Baudelaire parents, etc, etc, etc.  The problem isn't that "The End" doesn't explicitly resolve these issues for us (did anyone actually expect that it would?), it's that the layers and layers of intrigue that have been building up for years are largely ignored.  The true unfortunate event would be if the series were to end like this, with nothing more to bring closure to these outstanding mysteries.  This volume does add an extensive cast of new characters, however they are all as flat as a pancake (read the book, then try telling one of your associates or enemies anything about the characters Marlow, Larsen, or almost any of the other islanders for that matter - bet you can't).  This time around even the series' mainstay, Count Olaf, seem utterly lifeless and even out of character.    The plot of this book is rather dull, which is perplexing considering that this is the longest book in the series. What you will find within the pages of this book are 12 chapters of fairly slow paced and repetitive "story," followed by a long Chapter 13 that is so utterly ridiculous that the writers of Scooby-Doo would feel guilty ending their story (let alone a beloved series) in such a way.  It is as if the author got to the end of the book and noticed he hadn't moved the ongoing story forward, so decided to have certain characters monologue about the fates of others.  For example, we have all been wondering what happened to the Quagmires and expecting some type of glorious reunion, but I'm quite sure that nobody wanted to hear Kit Snicket say "yeah, they captured some birds and then crashed into the ocean, where the 'question mark' shaped vessel swallowed them up.  I don't know if they're alive or not.  P.S. - Fiona and the Hook-Handed Man got swallowed too."  Lol!  As terrible as that sounds, the actual text in the book isn't much better than what I just wrote.  Not to spoil anything, but the bit about Count Olaf's fate isn't much better either.  The pacing is all wrong: why spend chapters going on about the tedium of island life, and then cram the important contents into a few scant sentences?  Judging by the response to this book, it looks like old Lemony has really dug himself a hole.  The fans are mad, and justly so.  Even if the series continues in spin-off books for years to come, many fans have been turned of by "The End" and just don't care anymore.  The prevailing attitude is that readers would be better off stopping with Book 12; in many ways it is better to use your imagination and think of the millions of possible ways that the series could have ended, rather than reading the thoroughly unfulfilling way that it did end.  All I can say is that if there are future books coming, they had better be something 'really' special, or "The End" may be the beginning of the end 
 I just don't get the sixties guys sometimes. Maybe forty years ago pointing out the flaws in the American experience was novel, although coming twenty years after Henry Miller and others,  it was probably not that shocking to anyone that payed attention to the various literature. This is a smug book, with its smugness somewhat masked by Southern's cutesy tones and farcical situations that he sets up. Maybe it was groundbreaking then, but it comes off as a bit dated and ineffectual now 
 Never got hooked on this book. Continued to read and finished the book because she is Courtney Love's grandmother and wanted some insight in that regard. I thought it was boring and all over the place. Best memoir I ever read is "The Glass Castle." 
 First of all, if you know anything at all about encryption, computer security, and things like that, the technical stuff in this book will have you laughing.  Dan Brown obviously didn't research the topic, or decided to rely on public ignorance.  That's not a slam on the public, though.  Cryptography, computer security, and the like are not trivial subjects.  Still, he clearly didn't know what is and isn't possible, and in several cases his attempt to define technical jargon was just plain wrong.  The major characters in the story were extremely shallow and stereotypical.  What saved it character-wise was all the minor characters, who were somewhat interesting.  The locations and event descriptions were also good, and helped you envision what was happening.  Technical and character issues aside, the overall storyline, while somewhat entertaining, was not even remotely plausible.  The climax of the story was outright laughable.  You have a bunch of genius techies and codebreakers trying to figure something out that is blatantly obvious to anyone with any math/science/technology background, but the ideas they run through are what you would see from "average Joe".  No problem if these were average Joes, but they weren't.  So, I guess if you have nothing better to do and don't expect much realism or technical accuracy, I guess its as good a way to kill time as any 
 To be honest, I've owned this book forever but after seeing someone ask about it on another forum, I just wanted to log in here and write a quick review of it as a warning to potential customers because I found it so poorly executed. This book basically consists of Rooksby very quickly presenting a topic in overly simple terms and then citing hundreds of examples of existing known songs that are supposed to illustrate his idea. This sounds like a great idea in principle but in execution it all falls apart. The examples read like pure fluff and do not cover any detail whatsoever, he does not even go into high level things like chord progressions, etc, from the examples. I presume this is due to copyright restrictions, etc. It would have made much more sense to license a few decent examples and really show how they illustrate the point. Or heck, the book is about song writing, why not actually WRITE a few over the course of the book??  The CD that came with the book is literally content-free, too. There's almost nothing on it. Again, this is in spite of all of the external music cited (some of it obscure) and due to the lack of specifics in the book. The CD can literally be thrown away without harming use of the book. It appears to be included in the book as reassurance that there is something there... i.e. a marketing move more than a useful resource for the customer.  So, really, in spite of the hundreds of general examples cited in the book, there is not a single specific detailed piece of information I can remember off hand. Ie. almost no tab, chord diagrams, or sheet music style content. Almost nothing specific about the guitar's interaction with the rhythm section and the specifics of writing for the rhythm section or vocal melody are covered either. And of course, the tell-tale item: nothing is composed/written by Rooksby for the book.  Looking at the presentation, its very slick. The book looks nice, the layout is great, the writing style is enthusiastic, its easy to WANT to like it but when it comes down to it it's good looking book that doesn't achieve its objective. I regretted the time I spent reading this book hoping for it to get better... Thankfully it's extremely short too, but I won't even bother going there at this point. ;)  So, basically, this book is just flat out not useful and the time spent looking for a different, more suitable, book on the topic will be rewarded many times over.   Also, avoid Rooksby's "Riffs" book as well, it suffers nearly the exact same set of problems as this one 
 This phone arrived DOA and there is no way I could use it.  As usual, you get what you pay for 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 We bought this for our granddaughter's 2nd birthday 03/16/07 and had the item delivered to our house a month ahead of time. We took the items to their house to assemble it.  We founds missing parts and 2 side pieces were the same, when they should have been"a" and "D".  WE got 2 "D"  pieces.  Part "Q" was also missing 
 UPDATE 12-28-2004  The Judge may be gratified by this year's and last's great Public Intellectual Die-In, which winnowed Susan Sontag today, Jacques Derrida last October, and Edward Said last year. And thanks to the nasty ideological campaign against language of which the Judge is a part, both the Times of London and the New York Times had graceless obituaries for Derrida, which dismissed him as French, and verbose, and marginal.  This year, the leadership here in China authorized a translation of this appalling book and may have used it to justify a campaign against that micro Public Intellectual the blogger, who has the bad taste to misspend his leisure as Marx's critic of an evening if cattle rustler by day.   I do wonder if Posner takes satisfaction in this.  Posner is on record as disliking the very phrase Truth to Power. It is unlikely I shall ever be dragged into his court room for the very good reason that Appellate court judges abuse their clerks and cancel awards to widows and orphans in chamber and not in a courtroom. But if I am I hope to remember the words of the old play in which King Henry IV Part One does not wish to hear the word Mortimer, and change them apropos:  "Nay, I will; that's flat: He said he would not ransom Truth to Power; Forbad my tongue to speak of 'Truth to Power'; But I will find him when he lies asleep, And in his ear I'll holla 'Truth to Power!' Nay, I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak Nothing but 'Truth to Power,' and give it him To keep his anger still in motion."   ORIGINAL REVIEW  This book is deep nonsense, because it assumes without argument that public intellectuals participate in a "market."  The problem is that effective public intellectuals don't produce what Posner thinks they produce.  The public intellectual's publisher, and not the public intellectual, produces the commodity, that more or less corresponds to the activity of the public intellectual.    *Qua* public intellectual, George Orwell was an effective contributor to a conversation in which it was found that Stalinism and other forms of totalitarianism are dead ends.  It was his publisher that took his writings and made them into a saleable product.  However, Posner has made it clear in other books that he believes we all participate in a hypostatized Market, and can and should be judged based on Market criteria.  His Market replaces outdated ideologies like the dictatorship of the proletariat, while refusing to admit that it is indeed another ideology.  The problem is that if the "marketplace of ideas" is infinite in all directions, consisting of individual producers individually evaluated by atomized consumers, there is literally no way of telling whether the ideas, so marketed, are true or false.    The phenomenon is apparent on the Internet; for in place of a libertarian fantasy-land, in which truth appears because all contributors are equal, and none of them receives special consideration because he represents an institution or a public intellectual, we have an almost daemonic world in which falsity is given equal credence with truth.  Thus on the contemporary Internet, a 15-year-old kid who knows nothing about the law is prized as a legal authority because of the very structure of the Internet.  This structure provides no way of mapping authorities such that their views are certified by linkage to an authority outside cyberspace.  Cass Sunstein has described this problem as that of the "discourse cascade" where entire zones of the Internet are dedicate to false propositions such as the importance of the Second Amendment.  Nonetheless, Posner would destroy the institution of the public intellectual by treating the public intellectual as an employee who is found wanting in terms of a hypostatized Productivity of true and verifiable (or not falsifiable, within a time frame Posner gets to specify) ideas.  This is deeply dishonest, for Posner is concerned with deconstructing a priesthood.  The problem is that nature abhors a vacuum, and into the vacuum created by the absence of public intellectuals, rushes people like Posner who are public intellectuals, malgre lui.  What Posner misses is that public intellectuals are not entrepreneurs producing a mousetrap.  Instead, they are participants in a conversation such that it is completely meaningless to rate their output.  And note that despite Posner's faith in the Market, he mistrusts the real market.  For example, he probably thinks Adorno is nonsense, for Theodore Adorno was a Frankfurt School Marxist.  Nonetheless, the real market, in the form of computers at Borders and Barnes and Noble, keeps on putting the gloomy Tedster on the shelves, to be pawed by the grubby hands of us ordinary slobs, who are unconvinced that we live in the best of all possible worlds under the market.    Here Posner replicates an intellectual's mistake, which is to find fault with the decisions of the real market, whether in the name of what the intellectual thinks Marx said, or, in the contemporary scene, what Milton Friedman and Sir Karl Popper said.  For in a fashion reminiscent of Turing, and Godel, the real market keeps its own deconstruction in print.  Posner is mobilizing resentment against people perceived to be media figures and, since the ordinary educated person does not regard them as real, these public intellectuals can be targets of resentment.  When I worked at Princeton, I would occasionally encounter the public intellectual Cornel West, walking down Prospect towards William Street on my lunch break.   Cornel was most engaging and approachable, and reading his output I view him less as a scientist making isolated predictions, than a man engaged in conversation with the past, and with issues of the present day.  It is to me therefore ill-spirited to REDUCE Cornel, or anyone else, to a set of verifiable or falsifiable tokens printed in books,  and it is productive, in right-wing, mass media venues, of a new and very nasty phenomenon.  This is the public intellectual *maudit*, like Anne Coulter, who when bested in debate makes physical threats, which can neither be verified nor falsified, conveniently enough.  In Coulter's case, this is recommending that we invade Islamic countries and convert their populations to Christianity at the point of a gun.  Note that IF we adopt Posner's programme, of submitting public intellectuals to a sort of performance evaluation (to which, I should note, tenured Federal judges are not subject) this will produce precisely that form of public intellectual we deserve; the public intellectual who games the system to win and is unconcerned with truth.  On the left, this produces Stalinists.  On the right, this produces Fascists.  There is something Soviet, Latin American, or mediaeval, about a member of the Federal bench writing books about intellectuals, obstreperous priests, and felonious monks.  One senses in Posner's position as a Federal judge something of the mailed fist 
 Whoever wrote this book, the group that did, should be made to do it over again!  I'm not kidding, it is this horrible.  I've been a gamer, for a very long time and know what I'm doing; not saying I'm the best or anything like that, but I know when I see a crap strategy guide.  This guide is only a guide pertinent towards real life racing and not the game, as it speaks volumes on real technique and real cars, while neglecting the fact that we aren't driving real cars (while close), but a driving simulator game!  I want to know (see), like the previous guides each and every task and how to beat them; for instance, there is not one good piece of info on the driving missions, nor for any of the races.  The license section, on how to aquire them is great, but still lacking.  Check out the old Verus game guides, they did the last Gran Turismo guide, and you won't find nearly any complaints towards it...  Geezz, if we wanted a thick collectible Gran Turismo book we could have waited and gone to Ebay and gotten it cheaper.  This book is a ripp off for what you get, do not buy it, if you do you'll know why I said don't.  Make your own strategy or look one up online, their are plenty of legitimate online strategies, so dig in.  Take care and all the best to you.. 
 As much fun as sitting in your accountant's office with your lap full of tax receipts. Of course, there are worse things in life, but please, remind me of what they are. Better yet, don't remind me! 
 I purchased a copy of this book before reading the reviews - it was so bad I thought I'd come here and see what others thought. I know Networking for Dummies implies that the absolute basics are par for the course but the "basics" stuff is really stale material for a recently written book. If one is a beginner, they should be treated to modern information & new advances in technology that make networking simpler & accessable to the "beginner".The cisco product info is weak, the Cisco site offering way more information on each and every product mentioned in this book. If you want a good Cisco book, my all time favorite is Cisco: A Beginner's Guide (It's a beginners guide but not for dummies !) To be fair, I have read quite a few networking guides and several beginners guides and may very well be beyond the beginner level so perhaps I'm expecting too much. However, I can't say I'm happy spending the money - the info is old, too basic, and often I was able to get better information on the cisco site. Oh well.. 
 We subscribed to this magazine, in part due to the special offer of 12 free cycling booklets & road log with each new subscription.  What did we get?  A note letting us know that unfortunately "the gift described in the promotion is no longer available" and that "rather than keep us waiting, (they've) taken the liberty of sending the enclosed substitute..." The substitute?  A crummy little pamphlet.   I let it slide at the time, but several months later they were still offering this special promotion, so I wrote a letter to customer service stating that "since they now had the special gift, perhaps they'd be so good as to finally send ours."  No response.  Time came to renew and all of a sudden there was that offer again... so against my better judgement, we did.  And guess what!  Another note "unfortunately the gift described in the promotion is no longer available..."  and the same crummy pamphlet!    In short, if you're interested in being lied to, or receiving a stupid little pamphlet, by all means subscribe... if you want what you paid for, go somewhere else. 
 Tiger Rising is about a young boy, Rob, whose mother has just died.  He and his father move to a new and very small town and are living in a motel.  He makes friends with a girl, Sistine, who goes to school with him.  Together they explore the woods near where he lives and find a caged tiger.  Sistine wants to let the tiger go free.  Rob isn't sure.  Soon circumstances arise that make Rob a part of keeping the tiger caged.  The book wasn't subtle.  Similarities between the caged tiger and the people trapped in their own ways were really spelled out for me.  Willie Mae, the maid who befriends Rob, points out the moral to most chapters.  It wasn't bad so much as it just didn't feel right.  A strong point to the book was the characters.  Many side characters had some depth to them and throughout the story Rob and his father are more and more revealed as they deal with Rob's mother's death.  This isn't a bad book, but I still didn't like it.  I don't recommend going out of your way to get it, but don't avoid it either 
 This is one of Kellerman's poorest books.  When you FINALLY get to what is going on, it is ridiculous.  Don't waste your time on this 
 I have to admit that I love this set. Especially since I found it hard to find white flannel sheets. Most have some ridiculous pattern on it like snowflakes or snowmen! So when I found these and at this price I was quite happy. They feel great, not the best flannel but nice all the same. But after washing it 3 times within one month the fabric really weakened and the flat sheet tore. Later the fitted started getting holes. So since this was rather cheap I am not horribly sad about it. So if you are looking for comfy warm sheets for one season and then want a selection of rags for the rest of the year for housecleaning, this is the set for you 
 I was mislead by the advertisement. The shorts are skin thin and don't have pockets in them. Quality it is ok for what they really are ... pijama shorts. Maybe it is my problem 'cause I am not a native English language speaker, maybe not 
 Ladder 49 was not the type of film I expected-- I was hoping for a good, fast-paced action flick, which I got for about the first 5 minutes. The remainder of the 30 minutes that I watched was flashback to the rookie firefighter's first days at the station.   Someone looking for drama and a story about the growth of a firefighter would probably like this movie. However, those looking for action should probably look elsewhere 
 Ok- listen..I realize there are people out there who. on the strength of a director's name or past accomplishments, will laud any and every attempt at 'ART'. The other reviews of this barking French Dog of an Art film are fawning in the extreme. This is the worst film I've seen in years. Rare is the film that that is so bad that you collapse in tears of laughter. It's quite as if an elementary school film class got hold of good equipment, managed to slip the entire cast prozac and ex-lax and then proceeded to film all the characters from the neck down. There are stunning shots of horses legs, men's legs, chain mail butts and the occasional shot of a horses eye. This had some significance to someone- but was laughable as anything other than a skewed attempt at symbolism.The battle scenes were the best of the bad- the red paint spewed out of the fake neck of an armored mannequin was hand pumped- and yes..the fake dime store plastic arrow glued to the head of the obviously frightened and probably sedated horse almost killed me with laughter. Every film student should buy this DVD and watch in over and over and take extensive notes on HOW NOT TO MAKE AN ART FILM. Jeez- I'm sorry..but the most remarkable thing about this film is that ANYONE actually spent money making it. This ART film makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look like Shakespeare 
 "Final Analysis" is one of the worst, silliest films I have ever seen. I have now abandoned Philip Joanou's filmography. It is slavishly formulaic, and just plain dumb, they couldn't even get the effects right. This is one of the few times that you will most certainly find something better on the Lifetime Network instead 
 Not a real quality product, but I wasn't expecting much.  Good buy if you want to just try them out, but if you want lasting quality, look elsewhere.  
 this item has been backordered for two months. please send me a credit 
 I read them all.  Grishim, Turrow, etc.  Kermit has a good understanding of the legal process, as he should.  There is so much legaleze, the characters go undeveloped.  The plot is thin and never really grabs you. Some of the sub plots are so trivial, they go nowhere.    Kermit, you have the talent.  Now that you have written your book that first year law students could learn from, go write the next one for the rest of us 
 Did you know that Burroughs was straight?  Or Ginsburg?  Yep -- not a word about their homoerotic interests, either in the poems selected (or oddly slashed up) or in the intros.  We do find out that Orlovsky was Ginsburg's "companion" -- is this the year 1928? The editor evidently thinks  so. Instead of providing an honest introduction to Beat work, she inflicts  salacious, incredibly obscure pieces upon us, like a 6-page rant from  Michael McClure about (and I quote) "woman woman woman woman woman  woman woman." This anthology tells us a lot about the editor's  personal idiosyncracies, but it is not a balanced portrayal of the Beats 
 Who cares?  A completely mediocre band is given appropriately mediocre docu-coverage. What's truly amazing -- and the only interest the film holds -- is the towering self-importance of everyone involved with Wilco. Guys, just who do you think you are? You're not the Beatles, Coltrane's Quartet, or the Brandenburg Orchestra. A rather more interesting movie, perhaps called "I Am Trying to Break Your Eardrums", might be about Wilco's fans and why they're so tone-deaf.  Almost as bad as "Darkon". 
 I love all Larry Niven's books...Except this one. This is just bad. Jingoistic, simplistic, portrays the russians as mere cartoon characters, and the aliens are just so dumb. I just can't get over how bad it was. Incredible that a  genius like Larry Niven wrote this boring piece. Pick any other book by Niven and you'll be pleasantly surprised...Just not this one 
 It seems like a good idea... 'Las Vegas Hillbillys,' a kind of a 'Krush Groove' for the possum pie and moonshine set, starring Jayne Mansfield and Mamie van Doren.  Duelling blonde bombshells, right?  Ah, no.  Van Doren is looking sad and puffy in this film as a 'tough' but disinterested saloon singer, longing for better days when she was straining angora sweaters and scratching out the eyes of good girls everywhere.  Jayne Mansfield sports a series of tentlike grandma dresses of the sort later found adorning the fashionable Weezie Jefferson, reading from cue cards with a kind of breathy, clueless abandon which is probably quite fetching when she's not dressed in a potato sack.  One can imagine her on her rendezvous with destiny, thinking, 'Oh no, we're about to slide underneath that semi truck!  But at least I won't have to think about 'Las Vegas Hillbillys' anymore.'  Between the two of them, they don't get more then seven minutes' screen time.  This movie is ostensibly a musical, in the sense that there is music in it, consisting of fifteen- or twenty-minute blocks of bad lip-synching (in an 85-minute film) which do nothing to advance the plot, such as it is.  Watch for Bill Anderson's all-KGB-agent backup band. 'We are American high-fashion models.'  I gave this movie a whole two stars because they *can* sing, after all... give them a break.  Richard Kiel makes a surprise appearance as, can you guess? a thug.  He actually has dialogue in this film, of a sort, and in watching his performance you really get a sense that unenthusiastically bunny-hopping between cable cars in 'Moonraker' represented the pinnacle of his acting career.  The plot: Woody Weatherby contemplates stardom, inherits a debt-ridden saloon from his uncle, goes to Vegas, tries to run the place, has a twenty-minute nap.  In the last ten minutes Aunt Clem magically fixes everything and starts a cream pie fight.  Van Doren kisses Ferlin Husky, thereby completing her descent to the innermost circle of Hades.  The End.  There was supposedly a sequel to this, 'Hillbillys in a Haunted House,' but I frankly am afraid to watch it.  Be my guest 
 I really didn't like these stories.  The narrative voice wasn't compelling, and when I finished, I usually thought, "And?  So what?"  Not recommende 
 This is certainly an impassioned defence of beauty, and a 'feel-good' book, but it is so lacking in substance is barely counts as a contribution to the debate. It's incoherent at many levels, most notably concerning the switch from the accepted idea in part one that beauty is always particular, to the claims in part two that it is a function of certain qualities, especially symmetry. Asthetic symmetry promotes ethical justice? The idea of beauty as enlivening is also too simple. This is not good enough as a theory of the link between aesthetics and ethics. The account of the so called 'political complaints' against beauty is a set of caricatures. There is also a very weak accounts of Matisse, whose Nice paintings are regarded by Scarry as stand ins for real windows and real palm trees; some sense of what modernist art has done to the concept of beauty and why is needed here. There are many better books on the topic. 
 It's not too difficult to understand how "Behold a Pale Horse" has become "the best selling underground book of all time"(according to a blurb on one pro-Cooper website)--after all, people want to(and do) believe in outlandish things. The problem with the late Bill Cooper's book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy, powerful men. Cooper believed this, Cooper was a nut...therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut, too. Rightly or wrongly, this is what people believe. (If you're looking for a serious treatment of this subject, albeit from the POV of someone who thought it was a good thing, take a gander at Carroll Quigley's monumental "Tragedy and Hope".) To all the "if you can't handle the truth, don't read this book!" reviewers who know little to nothing about Bill Cooper: I invite you to do a Google search on the man and acquaint yourselves with another truth, the real truth. Milton William Cooper was a certifiable headcase. Numerous former friends and acquaintances have described him as a hard-drinking, ill-tempered, violent man who was incredibly easy to fool. Cooper's contention that John F. Kennedy was killed by William Greer, the driver of his limo in Dallas, is of course well-known...but he also believed, and told audiences at his lectures, that the aliens on the Fox television show "Alien Nation" were real aliens. He wasn't kidding. Cooper would hear or read an outlandish tidbit of information, then take it--and repeat it!--as gospel. Fellow "fringe" writers and researchers like Bob Lazar shunned Cooper after he accused them of being government agents who were out to discredit him. There was, of course, no need for anyone else to discredit him: he took care of that himself. Nowhere in this rambling patchwork quilt of a book(mostly documents and articles from other sources, really, with a comment here and there by Cooper himself) is there a shred of proof to back up his extraordinary claims. Cooper made no attempt to verify the info he included, and it would have been impossible to do so in almost every instance, anyhow.   I'll go on record as saying that I believe the circumstances of Cooper's death were suspicious. I feel badly for the man because he came to such an ignoble end, and because his affection for his wife and daughter is so evident in the foreword to "Pale Horse". This was a human being with real feelings...but he was very, very disturbed. There are countless other books which examine this subject more rationally; so many that "Behold a Pale Horse" should NEVER become any conspiracy theorist's bible.     
 Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars 
 Thank You for the c.d. in great condition.  We had fast service and would gladly do business with you again.  Thanks again, N and L C 
 All I want to say is this book is so boring.  All I wanted to do when I was reading it was shoot myself in the mouth with a pistol to end the constant eternal boredom.  I think all it was trying to do was impress a  few academic kooks who live in an academic bubble.  Yeah well its boring 
 This toy is a bit silly. My daughter likes to roll the balls on the floor, but it isn't nearly as much fun as some other pull-toys she has. The balls immediately fall off the caterpillar when a child pulls it, and it isn't heavy enough to even stay upright. It just sits on the toyshelf, looking cheesy.  I'd recommend investing in a quality wooden pull-toy, instead.  The only great things about it is that they didn't try to jazz it up with annoying flashing lights or terrible music! For that reason alone, we didn't return it 
 I used this book for a research project on ID that I was writing for a class. As a Christian, I find much of the book to be somewhat offensive. The story of "Dave and Katy's Metaphysical Adventure" is cheap emotional manipulation in the form of a sermon. The message is clear - the reason your teenager is "turning away from God" isn't because teenagers are at an age where they are questioning the beliefs of their parents and trying to figure out what they believe themselves, it is because he is learning evolution in school. As page 100 says, "Creation is the first element of the Christian Worldview, the foundation on which everything is built". This means Young Earth Creationism, the literal reading of Genesis. In this book, and the popular accompanying study guide, which is widely used by churches, this literalist interpretation is being taught as a statement of faith, i.e. "if you don't believe the literal reading of Creation, then you don't believe". Old Earth Creationists need not apply. Ironically, this also casts doubt on many of the Intelligent Design advocates who lean toward Old Earth Creationism, such as Phillip Johnson, and about half of the pro-ID scientists who testified in the Kansas Science Standards hearings in May 2005. This also is ironic since Colson writes the forward for Dembski's book "The Design Revolution", where it is stated that the identity of the Creator doesn't matter. 
        The book is called The Circuit. This book is about a boy named Francisco Jimenez who wants to be another person. He had a hard time in school because he almost knew no English. He couldn't understand her. He had 3 brothers and 1 sister and a mom and dad. The worst thing to him was getting deported.        In school he had a problem with 2 kids named Curtis and his friend. They were the bullies. Once Francisco had wore a sweater that belonged to Curtis. Of course he didn't know. He was lucky they didn't beat him up. Later they became friends.         His brother that was born after him had a rare disease, but he made it through. I think that people who would like this book are people who have boring lives. After every chapter he wanted you to put the book down. He didn't leave any suspense. I hated the book so much. 
 When I was a teenager Watergate was in full swing.  I had an incredible urge to hire CIA operatives to bug the Dems.  According to Jason, the president is nothing short of the spiritual leader of our country.  My bad 
 Pros:  solid construction, good feel, excellent sound quality, works with power out Cons:  keypad isn't backlit, caller ID isn't backlit (contradicts advertising as of 9/19/2004!), if on table then caller ID visible only when looking down at phone Neutral:  caller ID and programmable buttons (3 of them) dependent on 3 AA batteries  I've been on a quest for the perfect corded phone.  I wanted something with a cord so that there's at least one working phone in the event of a power outage, and I wanted caller ID since I enjoy knowing who I'm going to be stuck talking to when I pick up the phone.  One of my requirements for caller ID is that it have a backlit display so I wouldn't have to turn on the light in the middle of the night if I got a call.  I tried the AT&T 210 trimline paired up with the GE 29096 caller ID box, but that didn't work well since the box wasn't backlit and it kept clicking on the line as if it were trying to flash it.  So you can imagine my delight after having read the specs on the AT&T 240 corded phone.  According to the information on Amazon.com, it had the trimline profile that I like, a heavier weight to the handset so it doesn't feel flimsy, and a backlit caller ID unit built into the back of the handset.  Plus, it was inexpensive.  I bought one immediately.  When I unboxed it, I was happy with the weight and design of the phone, even though it doesn't have a backlit keypad like the trimline phones of old do, like the AT&T 210 that I was using.  A pity, since that's a nice feature and one for which I would have been glad to pay more.  So anyway, I hooked it up and tested it out.  The phone had a good feel to it, comfortable to hold as well as cradle between ear and shoulder.  The quality of the sound was excellent, both clear and without the tinny sound that can result from the audio compression in cordless phones.  I only had one complaint, but it was a major one:  the caller ID wasn't backlit.  Moreover, there was nothing in the instruction manual indicating that it was supposed to be, either.  This was a big gripe since the real feature of this phone for me was the backlit caller ID that Amazon.com advertises.  A possible problem for others considering the 240 as a telephone would be the orientation of the caller ID window.  As it's on the top of the handset, you have to be looking down at the phone if you decide to rest it on a table or nightstand, i.e., there is no accessory to clip on the back to give it an angled elevation nor, due to the location and style of the rubber feet, can an impromptu one be constructed.  This essentially means that if you rest the phone on a table then the caller ID window is viewable only if you stand up, lean over, or pick up the entire phone along with the base and look at it.  Of course, if you don't care who's calling then you can pick up the phone and just take your chances; to me, however, this defeats my main reason for caller ID -- not having to talk to people I don't want to.  If you just use it as a phonebook of recent callers, then this isn't a problem.  Also, if you wall mount the telephone then this isn't an issue at all.  I use this telephone in my bedroom but have it wall-mounted next to the bed so I can see the caller ID just fine...in the light, that is.  So, in conclusion, the AT&T 240 is a corded phone with great sound quality and a good feel to it.  I wish that the keypad were backlit and I'm quite unhappy that the caller ID window isn't backlit.  This is a good corded phone that, with a longer cord, could be a great wall-mounted kitchen phone.  I would not recommend it for a location where the lights may be out or the area could be dimly lit.  I am presently using it for a bedroom phone, but if I find another corded phone in a trimline model that has a real backlit caller ID then I will probably switch and move this phone to the kitchen or in a spare drawer for storage.  
 Read the book probably 5 times, charted temps, used ovulation predictor kits.  Now having my 3rd boy. I'm very happy with my baby, but just wanted to add my 2 cents that it didn't work for us.  Good Luck 
 I zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down.  Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that.  The main character just goes on a big, boring sight seeing tour.  It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design. There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it's very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings I've ever read.  The book just stops.  Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel.  It's a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with.  In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both, but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae.    Once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the GIANT FREAKIN' PORTAL BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--but enough about that.   Gee, what a lovely sofa.. 
 I could not get this disc to work right on either of my HD-DVD players.  It won't allow access to menues and it is extremely slow to respond.  I have a lot of HD-DVDs and this is the only one I regret buying 
 I was very disapointed with this book.  First it is a self published book that needs to be proof read and the font selected is horrid and hard to read.  Secondly, this is Stringfellow's soap box about her ex husband and work troubles.  It kept sounding like she was taking revenge on these people with her words, it just didn't set well with me.  The part that she did talk about Faith the dog, she really didn't go into any great detail.  Pass on this book and get Grim's book about Quentien, the dog who survived the gas chamber, its a much better read 
 I am a graduate student in organizational development.  Although this book has some good underlying concepts, I found most of the book hard to follow and not very engaging.  It was often difficult to see how many of the concepts actually apply to organizations.  There may be good ideas, but they often get lost in the rambling chapters 
 Why two stars?  Because there is a perverse joy that comes with reading this slim volume of new age hogwash.  People buy into this?  Hey, I've got a bridge to sell ya, too.  I did the exercises, they didn't work 
 You can eat when your hungry and stop when you are satisfied and still not lose weight if you are eating mostly the wrong kinds of foods.  It was only when I started eating right(lots of fruits and vegetables and whole grains)that I started losing weight!!!  I also found that when I started eating the fruits and vegetables that I didn't crave the bad things (candy and chips)so much.  
 IDEA REVOLUTION is a great title, this book is not...  This book should have been called LITTLE UNDEEP THOUGHTS ABOUT DESIGN, casue that's what it is.   Nothing usefull and mediocre design.  Just try not to buy it 
 I should say first that this should be a good movie, at least on paper.  John Hurt and Richard Burton turn in solid performances, and everything about the production -- set design, costumes, etc. -- looks just as it should.  But there is something lacking in this adaptation that makes it pale compared to the book.  Orwell's _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ was, largely, _about_ reading and writing, and the power they give to people.  As such, it is a thrilling novel, and a great pleasure to read.  Seeing John Hurt writing in Winston Smith's diary doesn't quite cut it for me; the essential spirit is lost in the translation to film.  Beyond this, there are also some more mundane elements of the plot and characters that were cut to fit the screening time.  What I missed most was Smith's growing frustration with Julia being "only a revolutionary from the waist down" and his schoolboyish admiration (affection, really) for O'Brien.  The only real highlight of the movie is the constant voiceovers coming from the telescreens regarding the progress of the war and the rooting out of traitors.  Orwell's vision is captured perfectly here, and the woman who read the "news" voiceovers gets the tone exactly right.  All in all, the movie is nowhere nearly as compelling as the book, and isn't really worth the trouble.  In the time it takes you to procure and watch the movie, you could be halfway through the book 
 I have to admit that I didn't like this movie very much. It shows Tom Cruise's domestic circumstances but this subplot doesn't seem to be woven well with the rest of the movie. 
 Maybe, just maybe, someone will buy one of these Stick Up Bulbs and maybe, just maybe, the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out. I thought to myself "buy another one because maybe this one was defective." I bought three more.....every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use. It's a great idea....but a worthless piece of junk. The spare bulb? Useless as well.   Don't waste a dollar on this junk. If I could have found the receipts I would have gotten my money back. 
 I began to learn Japanese over 2 years ago.  When first looking for interesting books to help me study, i came across this book. I thought that it would be fun for me to read and learn with colourful pictures. However, I was quite wrong after receiving this book. If you are an educated person who is trying to learn Kana, this book is NOT for you. It offers no real memorization techniques.   To be honest I opened and read this book 2 times before never opening it again, it is still in mint condition. If you are actually interested in learning the Kana i would suggest:  Remebering the Kana by James Heisig  If you are a parent looking to interest your children in another language, I think this book would be interesting for a child that is less than 13 years old 
 Oh yes, this book asks some interesting questions.  But one has to be a little suspicious of its point of view.  Many of us know that Ed Said attacked the entire field of Oriental Studies as merely a political device to support colonialism.  That certainly appeared dubious to those of us who saw scholars as people who were genuinely interested in learning about the subject.  Now we see a similar set of questions about archaeology.  And now it is Nadia Abu El-Haj who is wondering about the extent to which people use archaeology as a political device.  I suspect that almost all archaeologists are genuinely interested in their subject.   I can't believe that many of them want to be archaeologists merely for political reasons.  But that does leave unanswered the question of whether some archaeological research has become rather political in nature.  And I can see why folks might want to ask such a question, given the way that some scholars have turned much of the work in Middle East Studies into rather useless political propaganda.  Some of the other reviewers of this book have dismissed this work as pure anti-Zionist political propaganda, not just because it attacks Israel but due to a paucity of scholarly material.  They point out the author's lack of detailed discussions of what archaeology is and how it works.  And while there is some material here about what Israeli archaeologists have been looking for, there isn't a detailed appraisal of what these archaeologists have indeed discovered.  If there were, it would give us a better chance to determine if there has been something systematically wrong with what most of these archaeologists have been doing.  Plenty of people are interested in the past.  That includes Israelis.  After all, some Israelis can trace their ancestry back for many generations.  They are aware that Jerusalem has been the Jewish capital for quite a while, including the past three millennia.  It is not surprising that many are interested in discovering what archaeology can tell them about that time period and that some are enthusiastic about participating.  And it is not surprising that archaeologists have indeed discovered quite a bit.  It is a good idea to ask if archaeologists could do better work.  But I don't think the author does a very convincing job here.  Are Arab artifacts being overlooked?  Are bulldozers being used that destroy the small and recent Arab artifacts but not the larger and older Hebrew ones?   Those could be good questions, but I don't see much scholarly investigation into this.    El-Haj spends plenty of time discussing politics, but I don't see much scholarship in this.  She complains about the use of Hebrew names, but I don't understand such a criticism.  If there were a study of Germanic culture in Vienna, I'd hardly expect it to use the word "Becs" rather than "Wien" as the name of that city.      There are some interesting claims in this book.  Obviously, I could not overlook the author's quote of Clermont-Ganneau, who said that the peasants in the Levant were "resigned Mussulmans" when the Muslims ruled, "bad Christians" when the Christians ruled, "mediocre Jews," and "fervent Pagans."  That's music to my ears, but is it even true?  Matter of fact, just how much continuity was there from one group to the next?  And if it is true, why doesn't the author advocate a return to the Paganism that obviously is best suited to that area, rather than the monotheistic religions that appear to have developed in that region?  El-Haj says that "the struggle to realize a Jewish presence upon the land is perhaps best understood, quite literally, as having been a conflict over the problem of presence.  Archaeology, for its part, developed into yet one more dimension and ongoing practice of kibbush (of conquest)."  Goodness Gracious!  She even sounds, quite literally, like Said!  The author explains early in the book that some folks see archaeology as a science while others see it as a social product.  Well, I see it as a scholarly field, and I think that any other approach is unworthy of the name.  If El-Haj wants to some up with some constructive criticism about what Israeli archaeologists are doing, it ought to be on that basis.  And she hasn't done that.  Instead, she's written a political manifesto in which scholarship is something of a side issue. 
 I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character. 
 I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion.  While it was unique, it was too hard to get into.  I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care.  I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read.  The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club.  The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50.  Some loved it, the rest of us hated it.  There was no in-between.  I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it 
 I have used Wamsutta for years and have always been pleased with their quality and softness.  But I sincerely regret having bought these sheets.  I purchased one set, and, after the 2nd wash, there was enough pilling that they were uncomfortable to sleep on (all the little "balls" felt scratchy).  My husband asked me why we were using the "old" sheets instead of the new ones because they looked so worn!  I was so suprised that I called Wamsutta directly, and the very nice lady there assured me that I must have gotten a defective set, because that simply "doesn't happen with their sheets".  So I exchanged them with an identical pair.  And the end of the story is that I am returning this set for a refund because it is doing the exact same thing.  What a disappointment.  Absolutely do not recommend, and am now very wary of all Wamsutta products 
 This is such a waste of talent.  It was only published because Shiley Hazzard has written a better book.  The story was dull, the unkindness of the parents most unreasonable. What kind of people would ignore their children this way?  Depressing and a waste of time 
 At first, I looked forward to having one of the few HD tuners out on the market.   However, once I received the tuner, I was, sadly, disappointed.  I had a couple of problems with the product, one which made it unusable for my use and I returned the unit.  The first, fatal problem is that the power supply has a low frequency hum.   I purchased the tuner for a home office, and will sometimes work without any music.  I contacted the manufacturer hoping that it may have been a manufacturing problem, but they indicated that I should at least not hear the noise from "across the room".   Even when the tuner is off, it draws power for its clock and continues to hum.  The other design issues that make the tuner slightly clunky: 1) Accessing any of the presets requires pressing a preset button before a number making every station 2 buttons away. 2) The width of the display causes most station/song titles to scroll, and to scroll slowly.   The slowness may be based on the RDS signal, but I would have preferred to see the text all at once 
 I bought this book because I was very impressed with another Thompson book. "Beginning C++ game programming.". Unfortunately, this tome doesn't live up to that high standard.   I almost never use the CDs that come with programming books. As I prefer to type in the lessons myself. However I was forced to pop in the CD on the first chapter of this book when my code would not compile. Imagine my surprise when I opened the solution and saw "if( PeekMessage( &msg, NULL, 0U, 0U, PM_REMOVE ) )" where the book had told me to type "while (GetMessage(&msg, wndHandle, 0, 0))". Huh?  It didn't get any better after that. The text is poorly written. The editing is abyssmal. Maybe it gets better later on, but I'll never know. Because I'm not going to waste any more time on this piece of garbage 
 Sadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today.  Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page.  Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner "We're Here," which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of.  My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, "Honey, I see what you mean."   One can get the general gist, but it's best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.    	For example, when educated Harvey says, "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?" his pal Dan answers, "Allus can, till we begin to dress daown.  Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy.  Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows.  Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night.  Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?"  	I got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce's "Ulysses" than an unannotated version of this book.   	So why did I bother?  A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving.  The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me.  But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever!  (Let them read "Cannery Row" instead!)  
 I found this book disgusting in more ways than one. Is Ms. Klum really targeting women who feel they need to re-vamp their bodies, images, sex lives, etc? In other words, the average, moderately insecure woman? Wow, it really makes me feel special to see PAGES AND PAGES--even the inside of the front and back sections--filled with images of an airbrushed, overworked Heidi Klum. How can anyone aspire to that virtually unreachable level (as if Ms. Klum is anyone special without her makeup artist and hair colorist)? Certainly not someone who is taking the time to read this book. If you're in the mood for getting your ego stomped on or for seeing Ms. Klum in a book riddled with soft porn, shovel up the eighteen bucks and ENJOY 
 If you are looking for an unabashed cheerleader on the American Way, this book is for you. If you are already convinced that America is the pinnacle of Western Civilization, nothing in this book will change your mind. If you voted for George W Bush - you'll probably enjoy this book. On the other hand, if you believe America has made some mistakes and are looking for arguments to convince you that what you thought were mistakes were actually smart decisions - look elsewhere.   Revel is a lover of capitalism, liberalism, obviously an admirer of the USA and probably of George W Bush as well. He makes his disdain for many European positions, as well as those of the American left, quite clear. This is a book written for people who agree with American foreign policy. Revel is well informed on many American foreign policy positions as well as European arguments against those positions. On the rare occasions when he is not insulting Europeans who disagree with him, he provides intelligent and thoughtful views on foreign affairs.   The author spends most of the book distorting European views and insulting those who hold them. A fine example is his description of the US Missile Defense system. He claims that there are 2 arguments against it. One, that it doesn't work and the second that it will work too well and make useless the arsenals of the other nuclear powers. These are obviously contradictory arguments and he claims to be baffled that anyone could believe them both. Oddly enough, I've never heard from anyone who believed them both. I do recall the letter signed by 50 Nobel prize winning scientists claiming that the project is a waste of money. I also recall hearing from those worried about angering Russia and China.   Mr Revel's penchant for ridiculing those who disagree with him is occasionally amusing but never convincing. It's a shame. I think he's right on a number of points. If he would just turn his copious knowledge of foreign policy and his broad vocabulary toward convincing people instead of insulting them - he might actually have an impact on someone who doesn't agree with him already. 
 One day my 6 year old Son brought home a Junie B. book His 1st grade teacher reccommended He read. At first I thought the book was pretty cute, but as we got more and more into the book I noticed the HORRIBLE grammar being used in the book. Its not just this book either, the whole series has horrible grammar!!!!! I don't think its appropriate AT ALL for children who are beginning to read and spell to see that kind of grammar. I mean if it was once or twice throughout the book, okay fine that is kind of cute. But the whole book and SERIES is the same. Horrible grammar on every page (i.e. runned around my room, I helded my head up...ect.) Not only the grammar but Junie B. is a total brat!!! She whines and cries until she gets what she wants. What a handful!  All the children in my Son's first grade class love these books! Its awesome they love books and reading but Its a shame they love such horrible books 
 Lang Lang's powerful and fast fingers just do not work for Chopin.  Chopin's music is as dedicated as "dancing with soul" for every note.  Lang Lang's fingers are just too rude to interpret these subtle notes.  For Mazart Concerto, if you have listened to Horowitz, you will be disappointed with Lang Lang's recording too.  I don't even want to mention the rest recordings.  As I know Lang Lang performs over 120 shows a year.  He is talented and successful at his age. Yet he should spend more time on music itself and understand the virtue of difference. Beyond technical fast fingers, expression is all counts at last 
 A woman is killed shortly after the main character meets her for the first time. The killer is caught quickly and sent to jail but the main character suspects that there is something wrong. Sounds good on first glance.  The book is called "borrowed time" which does not describe the pace or quality of the book but is more an adequate description of what this book does to your patience!  How is it possible that the author needs almost 250 pages to describe a time span of 3 years when absolutely nothing happens that contributes to the possible riddle of the murder in the story or the entertainment of the reader? No events, nothing even remotely interesting, no romance, no jokes, no nothing!  Then a surprising confession of the (possible) real killer offers the chance to speed up the pace of the story and make up for the outstanding boredom before. Too bad that exactly the opposite happens and the book manages to be even more dreary then before.  The book could be summarized in less than 20 pages and might make an interesting short story but with over 440 pages it is only good for people having trouble falling asleep or those who like to use "satisfaction-or-you-money-back-guaranties".  This is without a shadow of a doubt the most boring book I read in 2003. In the end the only riddle to me still is: why did I finish it?? 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 My stars are generous. I liked this memoir the first time I read it, but upon reading it a second time I could only wonder what I was thinking the first time around. As fellow reader Bruce suggests, Tea's story DOES have merit and, I would add, social importance, but the ways in which she conveys her story--or fails to convey it sometimes--leaves much to be desired.   I feel like the real story is still in the walls of Tea's mind, in the walls of the house where she grew up, in the walls of words that she has contructed and called The Chelsea Whistle.  But hey, it's her memoir, not mine.   In short, Tea's memoir could be about 100 pages shorter! It had really good potential, but it does not leave a lasting impression. I would have liked to see Tea draw out more of the social issues and implications (relating to class, religion, sexuality, etc.) surrounding her coming of age. Instead, at some of the most crucial moments, we get walls--pointless references to what she ate on random days or how she tried to cure a yeast infection. (And trust me, unlike other writers, there was no symbolic value in any of these references.)  Nonetheless I credit Tea for being so open and candid with her story. I just expected and hoped for something different, something resonant and socially useful (especially since she calls herself a feminist). Something more. 
 This is the first book by Deaver that I have read.  Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.  Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.       A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.   And also, if the final "twist" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  I give this book a D.    
 This book is a fairly good introduction to Jefferson, although it is rather short for a biography of one of our most intelligent presidents.  The book seemed to quickly skim over his life, for example giving only one chapter to each of his presidential terms.  The Lewis and Clark expedition is barely mentioned and I would have liked to know everything that led up to that famous journey.  His scientific achievements are also only alluded to during the course of the book.  Although it is an easily readable book, I came away wanting to know much more and feeling I did not know the man.  Compare this to the excellent John Adams: A Life, and this biography falls well short.  If you want a short summation of Jefferson, then this book will suffice 
 In this book, perhaps more than his others, Rudy Rucker takes the common themes of Cyberpunk literature (the frightening/enlightening possibilities of technology) to unique and fascinating ends. For those looking for a taste of just-over-the-horizon technology in an all too familiar environment, you will find much to like here. There is the dependence on visual stimulation and passive entertainment, whose destruction brings about blood-thirsty mobs. There is the shift away from real-world social interaction and towards anonymous techno-societies that makes communication increasing awkward when not accompanied by digital interfaces. Finally there are the ethical and logistical problems involved in giving increasing control and autonomy over the machines that do not necessarily share our moral qualms.  In the end, however, the writing fails to live up to the ideas. The first hundred pages are awkward at times, excruciating at others. Once the meat of the plot begins, the overall writing seems to improve, but the dialog still seems stilted and the pacing is jumpy. Although I had hoped to attribute these factors to the stylistic choices made by many modern sci-fi writers, it became obviously that the writing simply wasn't up to par.  If you want high quality Rucker, you will be better off with his later *ware tetrology 
 It would at least meant that I cared one way or another what was happening when reading it 
 Power of Purpose would make a great magazine article, but there is not enough content here to make a good book.  "Creating Meaning in Your Life..." is not what this book is about.  There is lots of talk about  how important it is to have purpose in your life, but little about how to  create it.  Mr. Leider has a great reputation -- it must have come from his  other books 
 If you expect the same wonderful experience you received from reading "She", you will be disappointed by this book. Leo and party travel to Asia to search for Ayesha and experience similar, but somehow tiresome, adventures. Reread "She" instead 
 I was genuinely disappointed by this book given the interesting subject  matter and the review posted on Amazon.  Beyrer often loses his focus,  shifting from discussing the AID epidemic to devoting entire paragraphs to  an examination of Thai architecture and the temples of Chiang Mai.  I  applaud his effort to try to interweave cultural themes, but unfortunately  this book reads like a travel guide loosely tied together. While there are  some good insights and facts, it seems Beyrer's editors provided him poor  guidance to focus his writing 
 I found "The Buddha In Your Mirror" to be a much better book on effective Buddhist practice. 
 The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes.  Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be "artistic" in his craft.  Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed.  Wahlberg's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of. Wahlberg's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to John Holmes, although I don't know if the film-makers would admit as much.   At any rate, he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his "package."  This hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and LOTS of shady characters.  This sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie.  Well, it could have been, but all the way through there seems to be something missing.  There are times the film "seems" to try and convey a message, but I'm not really sure.     One thing I do know is that I quickly remembered why I've never cared for Wahlberg.  He has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt.   Also, I was expecting a LOT more skin than what the film delivered.  Given the context of the film, one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women.  That's simply not the case.  In the end, however, the biggest problem of this movie isn't Wahlberg or the lack of nudity.  The difficulty is that it's just plain boring.  I have more than a passing interest in the history of porn, and yet this flick failed to grab me 
 Geoffrey Perret is generally a fair historian and decent writer. His biographies of MacArthur, Eisenhower, and Grant were readable, but not great. In his biography of JFK, somewhat different ground for Perret, he comes across as a tabloid writer more than a historian. This is particularly evident in the early chapters, where Perret seems more focused on the homosexuality of Lem Billings than on anything having to do with JFK. Skip this one 
 Chicago's love song CD is not worth buying. Phillip Bailey who sang "If you leave me now" destroyed this song. I was so disappointed. The only reason I bought it was because it was the only one Wal-Mart of Pikeville, Kentucky had in the store. It sucks 
 I've read a lot of Kerouac's stuff and liked most of it. this, however, is truly pathetic, uninteresting and unnecessary. I guess if you for some reason need a portrait of the artist in decline... this is it.   If you've never read him please dont start here. This is only for those who already love and know what jack was capable of- we're better prepared to forgive disappointments like these. If you're new to kerouac do yourself a favor and start with things like the dharma bums, on the road and subterraneans- there's a reason these are as popular as they are.  It's nice and short, though.  I also want to mention that this is my first review- I'm not in the habit of trashing great writers lesser works. I dont need my opinions heard or validated. I just want to steer fledgling beat readers away from what could be an instant kerouac dealbreaker. 
 Joel Osteen almost never mentions the word "sin."  He's so popular because he tells people what they want to hear.  As for the book, it's garbage.  He says to stop thinking only about yourself and start thinking about others.  But the whole book is about thinking about yourself.  He says that you should be happy with what you do have rather than what you don't have.  But the entire book focuses on getting what you don't have.  He says Christians can get what they want by just visualizing and saying that they will get those things.  Does anyone other than Osteen actually believe that?  What about Christians who live in Rwanda, San Salvador and other poverty-stricken parts of the world?  Or does that way of thinking only apply in affluent societies?  He says Christians deserve special treatment.  But try acting that way at work or at a store and see how much others like you for it.  Don't read this book 
  Island of the blue dolphin written by Scott O'dell,was a great book. I recomend this book to 5th grade and up, dew to the books hard vocabulary. I like this book because of the exitement, adventures, and drama of karanas life on the island alone.Island of the blue dolphin is for people who like to read about survivle and adventure.I dont think people who only like to read about comedys mysteries shouldent read the book.   Island of the blue dolphinis about a girl who gets stuck on an island by herselfand learns how to survie and has a big adventure on the way. The main charcter of this story is karana. Karanas village was fleeing the island, but her brother forgot his spear and ran back.the ship left ,and karana threw her self out the boat to be with her brother. Shortly after,Karanas brother was killed by wiled dogs.Karana is now on the island alone.   
 One day I decided I needed to read every type of book out there. I usually ready fantasy novels. I wanted to know if I'd be interested in other books besides fantasy. I picked up a horror novel and it was slightly entertaining. Started to read a historical fiction novel but never finished. Then I picked up this up. I read the whole thing and decided never again to read a romance novel. This guy I forget his name now but he was so pathetic and weird. He wants to marry some girl from the telephone...stupid! But what pissed me off was the ending! DUMB 
 The books are in fine condition.  My problem is with Amazon! I will never buy text books on Amazon again!  Waited over 2 months for the books that were promised within 10 days.  Not just one book, but 5 out of 8 that I ordered. Never, Never again! 
 Reading this book was like drinking warm diet coke--flat and artifically sweet. Really just  a rehash of the Abraham Hicks/Law of Attraction materials, this books  fails to motivate or inspire. Between the plugs for the author's internet program and audio products there is just flat prose.  Even the sample meditation is uninspired.  The law of attraction has been addressed countless times and this book adds nothing to the mix. If you are seeking a thorough understanding of the law of attraction and techniques to assist you in its mastery, you would be better served by works by other authors, including Esther and Jerry Hicks, Lynn Grabhorn, Michael Losier and Joe Vitale. Avoid this tired retread 
 I first saw "Russian Arc" on HDNet movies on my Sony monitor, and was spellbound.  An amazing feat of cinamatography.  I had to own it.  But I mistakenly did not check to insure the DVD I was buying was in HD.  Watching this movie in anything but HD is not worth your time.  The incredibly intricate detail of the costumes, the fantasticly clear works of art in the background, all gone.  And camera pans are blurred compared to the HD version.  Almost my entire enjoyment of this movie was due to the amazing HD.  Without it, this DVD will sit on my shelf, never to be watched again 
 This is the worst Seal Book ever written 
 Don't get me wrong. The music that makes up 'Phantoms' by The Fixx is absolutely unique and wonderful. The one star is aimed at the corporation(s) that now own(s) these recordings. In an attempt to give the fans of this music something to enjoy, Universal Music/One Way Records has screwed this one up - BAD. How? They reversed the stereo image. To illustrate this all you need to do is imagine that guitar part that was previously known to reside on the left in the stereo spectrum - in the "remaster" it is now on the right. While that harmony vocal that you had previously heard on the left of the stereo spectrum is now -yup- on the right of the stereo spectrum. Therefore, a complete reversal of the stereo image - in every song, from start to finish. Kids, this is a major bummer.  In 1984 I purchased the vinyl version of 'Phantoms', which I grew to quickly love. So when it hit CD for the first time I added that to my library without hesitation. But like many of those recordings that were transferred from the original analog tapes to CD format in the 80's, I found the sound of the CD lacking warmth and bass response. Because of that reason I hung onto my original vinyl through the years. Recently, when I learned that 'Phantoms' had been "remastered" and reissued - I was hoping to get the listening experience that this music so much deserved when it first hit CD. I am very sorry to say that it didn't happen with Universal Music's "remaster". It's a shame.   The fact that three years after the re-release (it came out in 2001) no one has publicly voiced their discovery of this not insignificant error is a little surprising to me. If I hadn't of A/B tested this "remaster" to both the original vinyl and the original CD release by MCA Records then I may not have caught the reversed stereo image error right away. Thankfully, I did, and HOPEfully someone will do something about it.  I would also like to point out that I am deeply disappointed that Universal/One Way Records did not use the original liner notes for 'Phantoms', which in essence DIScredits all of those people who were originally responsible for producing the music and getting it out there. I see no clear reason for leaving those people out and in their place only giving credit to the "reissue producer" and "remastering engineer". Again, all of this is regrettable and shameful because 'Phantoms' truly deserves much better. 
 Dear lord, this is one of the most tedious books I have read in ages.  I generally love the Chick Lit genre, but this book is just annoying.  I find the writing boring and tedious and often quite juvenile.  The character is completely self-absorbed and a whiny...  Blech, it's really quite awful 
 I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.   
 I too was required to read this book in the 6th grade.  I couldn't understand how this book could be an award then or now.  I'm a huge Eckert fan, but this story just doesn't cut the mustard.  For a better Eckert book, check out Johnny Logan 
 Actually not going to be kind........... What a load of RUBBISH 
 The title of this book, as you can see, is "Something To Declare: Essays on France and French Culture." The blurbs on the back of my trade paperback version enthusiastically support this title. However, only a quarter of the pages of this book are devoted to a  discussion of "France and French culture." The rest are spent on the very specific topics of particular French artists and authors, most particularly Flaubert and things related to Flaubert. Given that artists and authors often make a point of setting themselves apart from their cultural milieu (especially most if not all of the ones Barnes writes about) and are often, at a minimum, a bit out of touch with the reality of the world around them, writings on these folks can hardly be deemed to reflect "French culture," as promised by the title. Barnes is, of course, perfectly entitled to publish a book composed of these elements; however, it would be nice if the title and blurbs made it clearer that that is what he is doing, for those of us poor unenlightened souls who do not go into a swoon every time we see or hear the name Flaubert -- for those of us who, in fact, would be perfectly happy for the rest of our lives if we could avoid anything more than infrequent passing references to Flaubert. Simply put, the title does not fairly represent the major part of what is in the book. If you are looking for a book on France and French culture, you can do much, much better with your reading time and money. Moreover, the essays that are not general in nature assume an intimate, detailed knowledge of Flaubert and his writing. If you do not have such an intimate, ready-at-your-fingertips, working knowledge, you will often not know what Barnes is referring to and will consequently have no hope of understanding the point he is trying to make, even if you hang in there and read the whole thing, as I did. These essays are intended for an audience of initiates;  reading them in a book like this that purports to address a much more general topic will just leave you feeling like an outsider to the club. Oh, and it will be even worse for you if you fail to hold the belief that "Madame Bovary" is worth intense worship as one of the greatest things to ever have come along, both before and after the advent of sliced bread 
 Networks are since a couple of years object of intense research in several different disciplines. One reason therefore is certainly the outstanding article by Watts and Strogatz, Collective dynamics of small world networks, Nature, 393:440--442, 1998. Unfortunatelly, this book can not continue the high level of this article. Actually, it does not really provide much more information than the article itself. I would suggest to read the article cited above and either decide for another book or to look directly in the literature and read the origninal articles.  To summarize, this book is not terribly weak, but one can clearly sees that it swims on the current 'complex networks' wave without providing enough justification for its existence. Of course, if you do not have access to the original literature and just what to have a general overview of complex networks and what be done with them, you may consider buying this book 
 I ordered these items in mid June, and my credit card was billed on June 22.  However I discovered two weeks later that, despite your having billed my credit card for items being purchased from Andrew Christian, the order had never been sent to them.  I was then assured that the order would be completed promptly (I told them I needed the clothing by July 19, otherwise I would not need the items at all)).  The order was not given to UPS until July 17 with an expected delivery date of July 21. Consequently I directed UPS to return the order unopened.  The handling of the entire mess was slopppy, and the billing of my credit card two weeks before the order was even placed was unethical and shameful.  
 With record or near-record numbers of divorces and unmarried adults, a supposed shortage of available men, dwindling marriage and birth rates, the seeming social acceptance of fatherless "families" and the social pathologies they produce in many of their children, the scary rise of religious fundamentalism, etc., it'll be the last few chapters of this book that most people will be particularly interested in.  Up to those final pages this is mostly a banal if readable partial re-telling of a lot of familiar material.  There's a lot of what I'd consider trivial detail mixed in, which could come in handy if you want to sound mildly interesting and erudite at cocktail parties.  But it obscures a lot of what's really going on, or has gone on in the past.  Any emphasis even on the basic shift from the religious/sacred nature of marriage to its more modern secular/contractual nature (not that it's much of a contract now) is pretty well lost in the noise.  And the origin of marriage gets very much fuzzified.  The roles and activities of men are so nearly absent through much of the book -- except when they're beating their wives -- that the book often slips into being a history of women more than it is of marriage.  It might not be too much to say the book's main accomplishment is in being a feminist-friendly telling of the story which doesn't use virtually any feminist jargon.  And Coontz has an occasional but constantly recurring and therefore annoying tendency to sound like she's got an axe to grind with the religious/wingnut crowd.  If so, she should have taken them on directly and written a different sort of book.  As it is it contaminates the history.  Consequently the ending fizzles and doesn't seem like a very convincing explanation for any of the current puzzling phenomena.  If good history helps us understand the present and how we got here, this book isn't very good.  I think this is basically because Coontz's model is flawed.  Dealing with linear time (and ignoring insignificant zig-zags) she makes the mistake of thinking things are part of a strict progression from A to B.  Hence, there's no going back in her view to "the way things were", which seems to be her real contention -- that whatever recent changes have occurred are permanent, so like-it-or-not we better get used to them.  Don't humans have choice?  Isn't change something of a constant?  Instead, I would recommend the advantages of an entirely different model than her's, one in which there are two distinct and perpetually competing systems (rather than some continuum), and that what we're now doing is *reverting back* to the basic animal/casual/matriarchal system -- the "love marriage" centers around mother/child biology, with men making their various appearances or orbits before exiting -- which prevailed for the tens of thousands of years before the invention of civilization, patriarchal marriage, and stable prosperous families.  But the love marriage is too concerned with the basics of survival and minimal sustenance to have much time for the luxury of intimacy, and it contains very little love.  With "marriage" in the industrial west these days being little more than notorized dating, and conferring no substantive rights whatsoever on men, I'd even contend we've reverted a very long way back: having gone from A to B, and then back to A again.  So there's no real reason why B might not come back in favor again sometime in the future if that's where we decide to go.  It certainly has mountains of misinformation and propaganda heaped up against it currently.  However, its obscure but important advantages could easily be rediscovered and come back in vogue, wearing (of course) slightly different clothes.  It embodies much of what people seem to long for.  But such is outside the range of possibilities in the limited model Coontz presents for us.  This book might be OK if one knows next to nothing about the history of marriage and intends to read several quite different books on it to get a variety of perspectives, but beware anyone regarding it as a bible.  It's merely "a" history, so it's by no means definitive 
 In many ways, this Beowulf is a lot of fun for kids.  The writing is direct and clear (although there are plenty of vocabulary stretchers).  The action is fun.  Beowulf's heroism is unquestionable.  But, I don't understand why one would publish a Beowulf retelling and stay just close enough to the original to be confusing (as opposed to John Gardner's wonderful Grendel, which told the story from the monster's perspective).  The most disturbing divergence was making Unferth a petty bad guy in enamored of evil.  In doing so, Nye sacrifices much of the nobility of the original.   I don't know if there are other kid-friendly tellings of this story.  But, I would look for one of those, first 
 ``People  say again and again that philosophy  doesn't really progress, that we  arestill occupied  with the same philosophical problems as were  theGreeks.But  the people who say this don't understand why ishas to be  so. It is becauseour language has remained the same and  keeps seducing us  into asking the same questions.  As longas there continues to be a verb  'to be' that  looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat' and  'to  drink', as long as we stillhavethe adjectives  'identical', 'true',  'false', 'possible',as  long as we continueto talk of a river of time, of  an expanseof  space, etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties and find themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no explanation seems capable of clearing up.And what'smore,this  satisfies  a longing for the transcendent, because, insofar  as peoplethinkthey can  see `the limits of human  understanding', theybelieve of course thatthey  can see  beyond these.``   ''Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language``  ``Ambition is the death of  thought'''  These three quotes are from Ludwig Wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago (but most people have yet to find this out).Dennett, though he has  been a philosopher for some40 years, is one them. It is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist, John Searle, studied under famous Wittgensteinians (Searle with John Austin, Dennett with Gilbert Ryle) but Searle got the point and Dennett did not. Dennett is a hard determinist(though he trys to sneak  reality in the back door), and perhaps this is due to Ryle, whose famous book 'The Concept of Mind'(1949) continues to be reprinted.  That book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine.  Dennett enjoys  making  the mistakes Wittgenstein, Ryle(andmany others since) have exposed in detail.   Byaccident,just before this book, I had  read ''The Minds I'', which Dennett coauthored withDouglas Hofstadter in 1981. They made some bad  mistakes(see my review), and saddest of all, they reprinted  twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess---Nagel's `What is  like to be a bat?` and an early version of John  Searle's Chinese Room argument explaining why computers  don't think.   Nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat's mind would be  like.  Searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize  thinking  and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does(eg,it can translate Chinese  without understanding it). Likewise, we lack a clear test for recognizing  what countsas good  vs bad--or just intelligible-- for many philosophical and scientific concepts. Our  use of the words consciousness, choice, freedom, intention,  particle, thinking, determines, wave,cause, happened,  event(and so on endlessly) are  rarely a source of confusion  but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy(and anydiscussion detached from the environment  in  which language evolved) chaos reigns. Wittgenstein  was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid  this. Unfortunately, he died inhis prime, his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of  how the mind(language)  worksand he never wroteany popular books,  so  understanding of his work is restricted to a very few.   Searle  is one of the world's leadingphilosophers and has written  manyextremely clear  and highly regarded articles and books,some of which have pointed out the  glaring defects in Dennett'swork.His review ``Consciousness Explained  Away'' of Dennetts 1991 book`'Consciousness Explained'' and his book''The Mystery of Consciousness'' are very well  known,and show, in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing,why neither Dennett(nor any of the  hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic)havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem--ie, how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.Many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things, but it isclear that we are  nowhere near it now. Dennett has mostly  ignored his critics but has favored  Searle with vituperative personal attacks.Searle has been accused by Dennett and others of  being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is(mostly) a branch of cognitive psychology and Searle has made it very clear for 30 years that WE are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious, thinks, etc,.  He just points out that we don't have any idea how this happens.   Searle characterizes as ''intellectualpathology'',the views ofDennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. Dennett repeats his  mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of  the book, where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how! Unsurprisingly, there isnot one reference toWittgenstein or Searle in theentire book.There arehowever, many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is.   Like most people, it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo  certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite  unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the  world. They are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.Wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30's, and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with.  Dennett says(p98)that  his view is compatibilism, ie, that  free will(whichI hopewe can equate with choice) is compatible with  determinism(ie, that''there is at any instant exactly one physically  possible  future''--p25). He wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. However, the whole book is smoke  and mirrors by means of  which choice, in the sense we normally  understand it, disappears and we are  left with ``choice``,  which is something we cannot choose. Naturally, this  echoes  the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ``Consciousness  Explained``.   It is remarkable that, at a time when we are  just beginning to  reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a  single neuron works(or how an  atom works for that matter), that anyone should  think they can  make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain  its most complex phenomena. Please recall the last sentence of Wittgenstein  from the opening quote: ''And what'smore,this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent, because, insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see `the limits of  human understanding',theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond  these.`` The  relation between language, thought and reality is  extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. If one is very, very  careful,some understanding is possible, but Dennett throws caution to  the  winds and we are dragged into the quicksand.   There are  at least 3 different  topics here(evolution of our brain, choice  and morality) and Dennett tries  vainly to weld them together into  a coherent account of how freedom evolves  from the deterministic  crashing of atoms. There is, however, no compelling  reason to  accept that bouncing atoms (or his favorite example, the game  of  life running on a computer) are isomorphic with reality.  He knows that  quantum indeterminacy(or the uncertainty principle)  is a major obstacle to  determinism however defined(and has  been taken by many as an escape to  freedom) but dismisses  it due to the fact that such events are too rare to  bother  with. By extension, its unlikely that any such  event will happen now or even in our  whole lifetime in our  brain, so we appear to be stuck with a determined  brain(whatever  that may be). However, the universe is a big place and its been  around a long time(perhaps forever) and if even one such quantum  effect occurs  it would seem to throw the whole universe into  an indeterminate state. The  notion ''there is at any  instant exactly one physically possible future''  cannot be true  if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur--in this  case  there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. This  recalls  one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics--each  instant our  universe is branching into infinitely many universes.   He correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice.  This obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon).  If so, they will definitely win at least one Nobel Prize, for not only will they have explained consciousness, they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence(how higher order properties emerge from lower ones). So, they would have to solve the 'easy' problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty) and the 'hard' one(what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc?). And while they are at it how about also doing the  impossible--an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain.  It is very well known that these equations are uncomputable, even for one atom or a vacuum, as it would require an infinite amount of computer time.  But infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer.   He starts off on the  first page appealing to the laws of  physics for protection against fantastic  notions such as immaterial souls, but physics is made of notions just as  fantastic(uncertainty,  entanglement, wave/particle duality, Schrodinger's  dead/alivecat etc) and as Feynmann said many times ``Nobody understandsphysics!'' Many think nobody ever will.   On pg  2 he says  our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and  on pg 2  to3 that our personality differences are due to how  our ''robotic teams are  put togther, over a lifetime of  growth and experience.`` This is a bald  dismissal of human  nature, of the abundant evidence that our differences are  to  a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early  childhood, and  is typical of his constant confused wandering  back and forth between  determinism and environmentalism.  On page  9 he notes that free will is a problem and our  attitudes to  it make a difference, but for whom? Nobody but philosophers. We make choices. What's the problem?  One has to step  outside life to experience a problem and then  everything becomes a problem.  What are consciousness, pain,  yellow, intention, matter, quarks, gravity  etc.? I doubt that  anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their  interactions  with people or their decision making processes due to their  thinking about choice. This shows that there is something  strange about such questions. Wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are  different. There are games  for language connected with the cognitive  templates for decisions  or seeing colors etc, and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. Decoupled modes permit  thinking about the past, planning for the future, guessing  the mental states  of others, etc, but if one takes the results  in the wrong way and starts to  think `'John will try to steal  my wallet'', rather than just imagining that  John might  do it, confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled  mode or distinguish it from coupled mode,  enter the realm of pathology. Some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be  seen this way--they lose control of which mode they are in, eg, notbeing able to see the  difference between the motives people  have and the motives they might have.   One can then see  much of the philosophizing people do as operating in  these  decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them  the  differences from the normal mode. Normal mode--eg, what  is that lion doing--  was undoubtedly the first one evolved  and decoupled modes--what did that lion  do last time or what  does he intend to do next--evolved later. This was  probably  never a problem for animals--any animal that spent too much  time  worrying about what might happen would not be very successful  contributing to  the gene pool. It is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed  culture and began degeneratinggenetically, could large numbers of people  survive with genes that  led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes.  Hence, we  have philosophy and this book, which is mostly about running the  decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real  consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results  in a book for other people to  use to run their engines in decoupled mode.' Let us alter Wittgenstein's quote to read:  ''As longas there continues to be a verb 'to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to  eat' and 'to  drink',as long as we continueto talk of  freedom of action, of saying I  wish I had done otherwise,  etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no  explanation seems capable of clearing up.''  As withmost philosophy books, nearly every page, often every paragraph,  changes from one type of language  game to another without  noticing that now one would have to be joking or  dreaming  or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc, and not actually  intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the  world. On page  10 he says we count on free will for the  whole way of thinking about our lives,  like we count on food  and water, but who ever, outside philosophy, standing in  front  of lunch counter full of food, ever thinks how fine it is that  they  have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral  water? Even if I  want to be a serious compatibilist and  try thinking this in decoupled mode, I  have to exit and  enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. Only then  can I go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have  happened if I had  not had the ability to make a real choice.  Wittgenstein noted how pretend  games are parasitic on real ones(this is not a trivial observation!).  The ability to engage in very complex  decoupled scenarios  is already evident in 4 year old children. So I would say  that normally, nobody counts on having choice, but rather we just choose.    On the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive  basics.  He says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual  atmosphere of choice,  and that `'It appears to be a stable  and ahistorical construct, as eternal  and unchanging as arithmetic,  but it is not.'' And on page 13--''It is an  evolved creation  of human activity and beliefs''. The whole thrust of  cognitive  psychology is that we do NOT learn the basics of planning, deciding,  promising, resenting, etc, but that these are built-in functions  of the  inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously  and start running  in very early childhood. There is no evidence  that they change as we grow,  or are in any way subject to  our beliefs,only  that they mature just as our body does.   On pg 14 he suggests  its probable that our having free will depends on our believing  we have  it!  Do we believe we see an apple, feel a pain, are  happy? The language  game of belief is very different from  that of knowing. We can believe we have  a dollar in our  pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can't  meaningfully  then say that we still believe it(except as a joke etc.). The  inference engine can run in decoupled(belief) mode so we can  imagine havingchoices or making them, but in life we just make them and it is only in very  odd situations we can say  that we believe we made a choice. But Dennett is  saying thisis the universal case. If making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else--consciousness,  seeing,  thinking,etc. If we take this seriously(and he says 'the serious problems of  free will' ) then we are getting  into trouble and if we actually try to apply  it to life, then madness is minutes away.  .  On page 65 et seq., he  discusses causation, intention and the `informal predicates'  that we use to  describe atoms etc, but cognitive resarch has  shown that we describe all  objects with a limited number of  ontological categories which we analyse with  our intuitive physics  modules and that when agents (ie animals or people or  things  like them--ie, ghosts or gods) are involved we use our  concepts (engines)  for agency, intuitive psychology, social minds, etc to  decide  how to behave. There is almost certainly no causation module  but  rather it will involve all of these and other inference  engines, depending on  the precise situation. Discussing  possibility and necessity is much  easier if  one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive  physics,  agency, ontological categories etc. Of course there is no mention  here of Wittgenstein's many incisive comments on causation,  intention,  deciding, nor of Searle's now classic works  on Intention and Social Reality.   He spends much time on  Ainslie's book 'Breakdown of Will', in which is  discussed  the hyperbolic discounting faculties (ie, inference engines) by which  we evaluate probable outcomes. Hemakes much of the excellent work of Robert Frank on altruism, emotion and economics, but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published. It was Bingham's idea, amplified by Frank and by Boyd and Richardson (1992) that  cooperation  was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. He suggests these as examples of Darwinian approaches  that areobligatory and promising. Indeed they are, and  in fact they are standard  parts of economic, evolutionary  and cognitive theory, but unfortunately, he  makes little reference  to the other work in these fields. All that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them. He does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice.   Onpg 216 he says that making oneself so  that one could not have  done otherwise is a key innovation in  the evolutionary ascent to free will,  and that we can only  be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive  to  opportunities. But where this ability resides is not revealed  for  several chapters! Dennett has a penchant for hiding  his ideas in a massive  amount of rather irrelevant text.  Again, he gets things backwards, as there is  a vast body of  very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get  the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and  these are not provided by some part of our conscious  self, but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the  engines. As he notes, hundreds of experiments  with the Prisoner's Dilemma  and related protocols have shown how easy it is to  manipulate  people's choices and that their calculations are not conscious  and  deliberate at all. When the situation is manipulated to  make them conscious,they are much slower and  less reliable. So, there has been  constant pressure of natural  selection to make the engines fast and automatic  and inacessible  to deliberate thought.  Dennett says `we make ourselves'  so  that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis  of morality and  choice. The evidence would seem to be exactly  the opposite. Our inference engines give  us basic moral intuitions and  we generally act in accord with the results.  If we or others  do not we feel guilt, outrage, resentment etc, then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.Our genes make us so we can't(mostly) do otherwise, not our will or whatever Dennett thinks can do it.   We can often choose to do otherwise but our own  intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval  usually serve to limit our choices. These intuitions evolved  in small groups between 50,000 and some  millions of years ago. In the modern world the intuitions are often not to  our  advantage and the social controls weak. This is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world.  On pg  225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will  as ''a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making(from certain angles)''. He claims that thisplays all the valuable  roles of free will but lacks some  (unspecified) properties possessed by  traditional free will.  The smoke is thick but I  am pretty  sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. He insists(top pg 226) that his naturalistic  account of decision  making leaves plenty of room for moral  responsibility, but making ourselves so  we couldn't do otherwise  does not seem to describe the way we actually  function, nor  does it seem to leave any room for morality, as that would seem  to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise.   He  does not propose  any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary  or forced and I doubt he could  do so. Normally if someone  asks us to move our hand, we know what counts as  having a  choice, but, typical of philosophers, I expect that regardless  of  whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position.   At this point he also starts his discussion of Libet's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that I felt was worth my time.   On page 253 et seq., he sneaks in his definition of conscious will--the  ''brains user illusion  of itself''' which has as one of its main roles  providing  ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times``.  And ``Illusory or not, conscious will is the persons guide  to his or her own  moral responsibility for action.`` He says  the trick we need is to see that  ``I`' control what is happening  inside the ''simplification barrier''...  ''where decision  making happens''. ``Mental events'' become conscious by  ''entering  into memory''. ''The process of self description... is  what we  are''. The crucial thing is that choice is possible  because the self is  distributed over space(the brain) and time(memories).  He realizes this is  going to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really understands!). ''I know that many  people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. It seems to them  to be a trickwith mirrors, some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness, and the real Self , out of the picture just when it was about to  be introduced.'' Many will say he took the words out of their mouth, but I would  say it's incoherent and  thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole  universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims)  was gone long beforewegot this far.    On pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals!  This is a stunning denial of human nature(ie, genetics and evolution) coming from the person who wrote 'Darwin's Dangerous Idea''!  Presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space(the brain and other people) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom).  He says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you will have to suffer through 'Consciousness Explained to find that there is no answer there either).  Though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology, he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind, intuitive psychology, coalitional intuitions etc) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts. If he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture, thats ok, but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes.    We are also told here that R&D(by which he means evolution here, but other things elsewhere) has given us the self  and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality.  I am sure that he will get little agreement on this.  It seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates(and earlier) long before spoken language(though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain).  He continues ``morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago`` which would be OK if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake!  And then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes, which is an amazing (and totally incorrect)thing to say, even if he was only referring to memes.   On pg 260 he claims  that  because we do not comprehend our ''bland dispositions  to cooperate'', they  mean nothing to us, but it is the operation  of our templates that is  everything to us. There is ample  evidence that if one of them is damaged a  person cannot function  properly as a social being(eg, autism).  I would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead Dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think.    He also says here that it was one of the major  evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them. This again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology.  I know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions, like all the templates, are accessible to consciousness.  We may decide our cheating was justifiable, or forgive someone else's cheating, but we still know it was cheating(ie, we cannot change the engine). I suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings.  Another issue is that as culture developed, one had to make many important or 'moral type` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer.    On pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines) with reflection and mutual persuasion. And on pg 286 he says that it is a child's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that affects moral reasoning. Again, he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research--the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing. We are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self, which takes responsibility.  It is not any more coherent or credible with repetition.    On pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education(memory) and sharing.  It's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments. On pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago--ie, they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people.  He also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes(eg see 'The Blank Slate').   He often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology, but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion.  This happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like 'praiseworthy' were shaped over millennia by culture, while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms.   On pg 262 he tries to explain how an ESS(Evolutionarily Stable Strategy) can produce morality. His idea here is that genetic `R&D` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture(memetics) produces variations and clarifications.  I would say that we all know, and much research has made clear, that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases.  Culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings.    The last part of the book is mostly  concerned  with moral culpability. He refers to the legal classic by Hart  and  Honore, which I started reading 30 years ago since it's  authors were deeply influenced by Wittgenstein.  Dennett tells us that we have  control over our own morality and  that thinking about morality will improve us.  But, there seems  no justification whatever for this view in this book. There is nothing at  all  here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. It is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that  has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of  spirituality in this entire book--another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. I find  more wisdom about how  to be free and moral in any of Osho's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy. One rarely finds spiritually and morally  advanced people teaching at universities. There is no sign here, nor in  anything he has done, that Dennett is morally superior. After 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them.  It seems clear that, like all of us, he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines.   So, how much opportunity is there to  improve our morality? It seems  clear(eg, see Pinker's `The Blank Slate`) that  most of our behaviour  is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our  environment, in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties. On  average, maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior(variations are the only thing we can  study) is due to our own efforts. The moral choices that matter  most today are  those affecting the fate of the world. But our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect.   How remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is.  And if one did, we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fMRI  equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc.  But a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking, coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is!  And then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first.  To return to the quote at the beginning--'Ambition is the death of thought'.  Indeed--though clearly Wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts 
 Even though fans of HK cinema have as a whole come a long way since HK films were generally only seen in the states on Saturday afternoon television, some studios are still refusing to provide buyers with the option of seeing HK films in their original language with subtitles.  This film is available from Columbia Tristar only in a dubbed format, and for that reason I won't be getting the Region 1 release of this film 
 It sounded like a remix sung by someone else, not at all like the original.  My husband and I were very disappointed and because of it I haven't even opened the other CDs by KC & the Sunshine Band that I ordered.  Don't order this product 
   This is not to fault the vendor from whom I purchased this item used, the price as new was even more. And not to question the information enclosed therein: it's probably fairly accurate and all that. But to use the word "book" as a physical description is misleading. Try a handfull of paper squares with a couple of staples banged into the middle and folded over. I've seen free handouts with a more substantial construction. A fair price for this should be somewhere south of 3 dollars I would guess. Or better yet, the information should be up on a website where it can be viewed and downloaded for free. (Hmmm, there's an idea)   So do what I should have done if I'd been using my noodle. Go to the reference section of your local library and use the copy machine. And take the money you saved and buy a real book.    
  This book was a gift for a friend who reported "Good writing style. Rough content. Sometimes hard to take. Depressing." so I decided not to read it 
 We all know that Tamilee has that body.  Didn't expect her to be the only body in the video.  I am more for a group atmosphere.  So in that regard, I pass on this video.  Maybe next time Tami... 
 I'd like to give this game a good review, but unless you read the fine print, you may be as dissapointed as I was to discover that it doesn't work on LCD televisions.  It also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets 
 I don't think this book gives an accurate veiw of what kindergarten is like. I teach pre-school and have been to kindergarten classes with the children. This book gives an idea of what pre-school is like 
 Am I the *ONLY* person who thinks Thoreau was an arrogant snob who did nothing but whine? Maybe it's because I'm an Englishman in America but all I hear is American educational institutions praising Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience". I don't deny that he has made some points worth considering in his book but many people have made the same points without whining and railing at humanity.  I would dearly like to say I had the patience to read this book all the way through but it is perhaps the only book I've ever read that I couldn't finish. I found it hard to separate Thoreau's genuine, honest observations from his juvenile complaining.   The phrase that most ran through my head (shortly before I deleted the book) was "o'erweening arrogance". The man's arrogance is astounding. He supposes himself so far superior to his peers in EVERY way.  I found his writing to be confused and self-serving. He could barely hold a topic for one page at a time before veering off on to another, entirely unrelated one. He skips from subject to subject and often contradicts himself within the same chapter.  I got the electronic version of this book and, to date, it is the only book I have actually deleted. So, I'd love to pepper my "critique" with quotes that I found completely offensive and juvenile but that would mean getting the book again and I *really* don't want to do that 
 Clavell is often ranked among the greatest writers of the last quarter of the twentieth-century, and I am not at all sure he belongs there. I've read several of his books and while I loved Shogun, ALL his novels had:   A) The same recurring themes and in a few cases literally the same storylines (and even the same sentences) recycled for re-use....   B) The same frustrating lack of a definite ending...   C) A habit of carrying the "Asia good/Europe bad" tone a little too far.   Clavell here dishes up a looooong, slow as a melting glacier, story of westerners in 1860's Japan, all of whom are trying to better themselves with economic or political opportunities in this newly-opened Asian kingdom. The French, the Americans, and the British are all in competition for control of the island, as are a number of cut-throat international corporations. Gai-Jin (a rude Japanese term for a person of foreign birth, roughly equal to such western slurs as "WOP" "Spic" or "Mic") is simultaneously the story of internal strife in a Japan in transition from the age of the samurai to the era of industrialization: and ultimately global ambitions.   Clavell introduces generally well-conceived characters but there isn't much of a story to move them through. As is so often the case with this man, there is a constant sense that "wow, something big is going to happen soon in this novel" and then upon reaching what passes for an ending, discovering that despite your long-held hopes, nothing ever does happen.   When I completed this demanding, often far-fetched novel, I cannot say I had regrets for having read it, but I do remember a strong sense of letdown. For those interested in saving themselves roughly a hundred hours of reading time but getting the same story in return, watch Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai, which is set in the same time and place as Gai-Jin, and deals with roughly the same themes and issues 
 It's true, you can't judge a book by its cover.  I was so looking forward to reading this book, but was disappointed that it is only a dry description of the author's travels.  If you are looking for a book that is more of a "novel" about Iran, this isn't it 
 ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz...... . Hmm... huh... huh what?!? OH! Hello! I'm sorry, I was sleeping in the middle of reading this book! My apologies.  Oh, you want to know if this book is worth reading?  Hm, well I'll try to do my best. I just woke up you know... Let's see: Well the author is Jack Kerouac - supposed to be a famous American Author or something right? I've read many books by many fine authors, and this book certainly doesn't rate up there with them.  I've read books about travelling around America, road trips and such, and this book is horrible in comparison.  Not terribly interesting, not fun to read, no plot and no real story.  Hm... it's a waste of time - boring - that's why I fell asleep!  The book is about this guy, sounds sort of mental, travels haphazardly across the U.S. with some very strange friend(s) off and on.  Nothing of any particular note happens, and the people he meets along the way barely get a sentence or 2 describing them.  Disjointed, unimaginative, a total bore.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get back to sleep........... 
 Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original. Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya 
 I have my own personal barometer to indicate whether or not a book is second-rate (or worse).  I start counting the typos, and when I hit "five," I officially distrust the author/editors.  I hit five by the third chapter and knew I was in for a bumpy ride.  This author should have concentrated on spell-checking and fact-checking, rather than obsessing with his thinly veiled,homophobic assertions (as mentioned by another reader, his repeated reference to "Leo McCrary" nearly made me hurl the book across the room!).  This really was a maddening read, and it is hardly the biography that the great Gene Kelly deserves.  Makes one even sadder to ponder that Kelly's own autobiography was lost when his house burned down in the 80's.  That would have been a helluva read.   
 Other reviewers have used words like powerful and enlightening. I respectfully disagree.  The character development of every chaacter was weak.  Birdies parents were so one dimensional.  Ms.  Senna seemed to think that there history was unimportant to the story.  For a white woman and a black man to marry in the 60's the was radical and possilby life threatening yet she didn't think it was important enough to really explore other than a paragraph or two.  Did her mom marry a black man to hurt her mother??  Did her father marry a white woman as part of his long term social expermiment??  Or did they really once upon a time love each other??  We never learned what Birdies mom was doing in her basement. We had nothing prove that she was involved in a social and politcal relovution. Was it as serious as her mom  made it out to be or was she just being paranoid? More imporantly why did her parents breakup and separate the girls?? Was it really because the FBI was after thier mom or was thier father tired of his biracial family experiment?? These were some unanswered questions that Ms. Senna did not bother to explore.  Instead of really exploring to complex world of a biracial family Ms.  Senna spent way too much time on Birdie and her time passing a white.  "Jesses" involvement with Nick was so pointless and and waste of time.  Instead of Nicholas and Mona Ms. Senna should have developed a relationship between Samantha and Jesse.  Of course Samantha knew that Jesse was passing. Many people of color can tell when someone is passing.  Why Ms. Senna wasted this wonderful opportunity for these two girls talk and explore how they coped in an all white town will always remain a mystery to me. There were also some sterotyping that I found very weak and annoying.  For example this obsession that Ms. Senna had with lotion.  Just becasue Samantha was raised by a white family meant that she had never heard of lotion?? Just like Birdie and Cole never used lotion until they when to school.  She made it sound like lotion was well guarded secret by the Black community. Also was they Samantha and Stuart were portrayed.  They were written as two people who tried too hard to ignore that they were black and were willing to accept slights and racist jokes to be accepted.  Maybe that was one way to cope but not the only way.  Finally the book took way too long to get ultimately nowhere. It took me three long months to finish this book and it was not worth the effort.  If you want to read a "powerful" and "enlightening"  book please read Ladies Coupe by Anita Nair.            
 I received my Stamina Products Adjustable Hyperextension Bench on March 13th of '07 and was very disappointed. There was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box. The product was scratched and parts were broken.   Fortunately the bench works, but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage. The product seems to be of quality, it's just unfortunate that SPS doesn't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap 
 I concur with my fellow reviewers that this Casebook contains more typos and grammaticla errors than a first-grader's book-report!!  If your Torts prof is excellent (and mine was) such editorial problems won't keep you from getting a good grade.  But, to be sure, buy the Examples and Explanations by Glannon and a good commercial outline to supplement this POOR casebook!  Finally, I wholeheartedly agree with one of the reviewers who indicated that this casebook is VERY much biased towards the plaintiff's bar and against defendents, businesses, or "the MAN" 
 What is Zionism and why must it be critiqued.  This book is addressing the latter, but we must address both.  Zionism is a nationaist idea coming from the late 19th century.  It is nationalist and religious and secular(one of many ironies) and embraces the Jewish people's quest for a nation.  We must view it as we view pan-Turkism.  pan-Tukism views the Turks as a people, but the Turks are also Muslim, thus it encompasses religion and nation. Jews are basically the same, a nation wrapped inside a religion, like all old tribal religions used to be and like Hindu Nationalism is today, and we might at Japan is.  Zionism was socialist.  It looked for a land, originally Uganda, and then Israel, which shoes just how unreligious it originally was, since it didnt see Israel as essential.  In Israel is did suprisingly well and like most national movements it envisioned a 'greater' version of the homeland, like 'greater' Greece or 'greater' Serbia, or Ukraine.  The critique is that it doenst have clean hands.  Most ideologies dont.  Ideology and its affects are not two in the same.  COmmunism isnt inherently evil, but it is responsible for evil.    However the contemporary critique of zionism is decidedly a left wing communist view that nation doesnt matter.  But then COmmunism died and so did Zionism.  Zionism and its ideals died long ago.  So why is this book trying to put a new spin on it?  Most likely what we are seeing here is an appeasment of the international media, the neo-nazi and the islamist obsession with 'zionists'.  However zionists dont exist.  It is a red herring, like those who used to find communist conspiracies everywhere.  This book is outdated and lacks percpective.  Seth J. Frantzma 
 A work of fiction is a great thing, but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong.  Why not just make up a story with no historical basis 
 I bought and used this book for a probability class and for preparation for the Society of Actuaries (SOA) exam course 1.  I had never had a probability or statistics class and this book did a very poor job of helping me to understand the topics.  I had to resort to using other books not required for the class in order to understand anything.  I did not pass the the SOA exam and I blame that, in part, on this stupid book.  I also had about 50 class mates, all of which had just as much disgust for the book as I did.  Not disgust for the class but for the book 
 I found this toy to be a waste of money.  It was hard for my five year old to close or put more than two things in it.  It says it holds three barbie's and cloths but then how do you close it 
 Thought this CD would be funny after seeing it promoted on John Daily's Show. We tried everywhere to find it and finally found it on Amazon. What a letdown we had after finally receiving it and listening to it. This was a total waste of our money. It wasn't funny at all - would probably call it sick or stupid. Thought this guy was a comedian - he must be on his downhill slide.  He isn't funny at all!  Please don't waste your money on this one.  
 I thought this book was dull and disappointing.  If you are looking for just a bit of light reading for the sake of a story, this may be the book for you - but if you are looking for a novel that is intriguing, moving and involving, this certainly didn't make the grade for me.  The writing is dull, the characters are flat, the plot moves along like a simplistic fantasy with the characters making their choices with an unrealistically shallow level of conflict.  I personally found I was unable to empathise with any of them because I felt they just weren't real to me, despite the book's issues being quite close to my heart.  It's magazine-rack stuff 
 A bittersweet story that reveals the carefree and emotionally careless rogue that lived behind the mask of devoted husband and family man. I remember as a small child of 5 back in 1957  wishing that Guy Williams/Zorro was my Dad... instead of the everyday workingman who was. I grew out of that fantasy shortly after that, but after reading this book, I now can appreciate even more who the truly heroic men in this life are: the men, like my own Dad, who are ALWAYS there for us... working hard... juggling schedules to make sure they make it to our games, or our plays, or our Father/Daughter dances... or to simply tuck us in at night... and the devoted husbands... who truly care about those they love... and those who love them... and show it every day... in their words and in their actions.  What is revealed in this sometimes amateurishly written  biography by a devoted fan, is a man who in one breath is described as selfless and caring... and yet in the next breath a selfish and sometimes cruel man surfaces... one who abandons his family for months and even years on end... who tramples over his family's feelings while exalting in the false glory heaped upon him by faceless, nameless fans. Who is so taken by the empty glory he found in a 2 year acting role (Disney's Zorro) that he spends the rest of his life pretending to be that character in show after show all across Argentina when his career has been labeled a joke in the US.   Had the book simply revealed a few foibles... those imperfections that we all possess... I would have continued to admire Armando Catalano (aka: Guy Williams)... but instead this biography unearthed the dirty truth about a man who emotionally tormented his devoted wife; drawing her in with words of love and promise, all the while keeping his distance, both emotionally and physically, whenever it suited him or his selfish purpose. A man who kept a wall up between himself and his only sister... a woman who simply wanted him to know her and TALK to her.  I do not fault his family for trying to remember only the good things when they speak of him in this book. THEIR devotion and love for HIM was never at question. I suppose only an outsider such as myself, the reader, not hindered by the myopia of family devotion, can see the truth in the shallow life Mr. Williams cultivated. That he died alone (his corpse unnoticed for almost a week - the author deliberately omitting the fact that it was the smell that finally made the neighbors curious) in his adopted country of Argentina, that country that professed to love him so much, seems somehow sadly poetic.   If you are, and wish to remain, a devoted Guy Williams fan, I do not recommend that you read this book 
 I can't believe how complimentary the reviews on here are for these poems. Ugh. When I read them, I want to tear every last hair out of my skull. 
 this book wasn't all that great.  and, that's being nice.  i love horror, and it had mediocre reviews on here, so i thought i'd check it out.  i was disappointed.  it does have some good points.  i enjoyed the sections with the young babysitter and the little girl she was watching.  but, the rest just sorta sucked.  the rape scene wasnt frightening.  it was ignorant.  and, it isnt all that gory of a novel.  as for the political point, we get it.  that factor is too simple, too cliched, and too trite to mention.  also, the trying to overcome the racism aspect of the book makes the book racist in itself.  as simple as it is to read, im having a hard time getting through to the end.  and, the other reviewer on here was right, he uses the word "rump" about 117 times in the novel.  buy another book, instead.  or, do what i did, check it out at the library 
 "A provocative and surprising thriller." (Fangoria)  Yeah it is surprising, surprising-ly bad. It's also provocative, it provoked me to write this bad review.  From the beginning I could tell the director, Chris Fisher, was attempting to create a stylistic film.  However, after the third pointless scene of swirling overlapping shots and panning camera work I gave up.  If you're using style, have a reason.  Style without reason is not style.  This film is one thing, if nothing else, a great lesson in how to over use overlapping shots (also known as crossdisolving shots).  Drink too much and spin around for 10 seconds and you'll get the same effect as the camera work/editing of the film.  There's so much overlapping shots in this film, there's probably 2 1/2 hours of footage on the screen in the 85 minutes that the film is.  It's full of tallent, bad tallent.  It's more about naked women, sex, and drugs than the actual story.  I expected a cheap nock-off of The Life of David Gale. I would have enjoyed that 100 times more that this.  This is bad, annoyingly bad.  Some moron wanted to make a film and got all hung up editing.  Annette Davey, the editor, should have her name removed from the film.  Unless, for some unknown reason, she's proud of her work. If I was studio head at Silver Nitrate Entertainment and somone presented me the final cut of this film, I'd have everyone and anyone associated with it fired, immediately without question.  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment made a mistake with the distribution of this film.  If you enjoy good movies and great camera work, STAY AWAY from this film 
 If this book was any lamer, it would need crutches.  Keep your fingers crossed (get it) that you do not recognize 90% of these "fine art" gestures as the same ones you see in the artless US of A.  I give this book one star which is still an over rating since there is no half star.  If you are still considering this book, point the index finger out and the thumb up and put it at your temple -- pull the trigger (page 64) 
 Wished I hadn't spent that amazon gift certificate on this one.  This sure as hell ain't the rock n' roll of their other albums, which I suppose it's not meant to be.  I'm going to pretend that this album never happened and hope that their next release blows the top off the bubbly.  
 I workout all the time and I am constantly buying new health books and comparing them to each other and adding  what i read and learn to my workout routine. This book is great for someone who has not picked up a weight in their life. For someone who is intermediate or advanced its not worth the money. Yet i bought it anyway just to have in my collection. If you really wanted to get serious about it I recommend "arnolds encyclopedia of bodybuilding" it is by far the best boook for adding muscle and trimming down. (be advised Arnolds book is for those who really want the info to buff up 
 "Why has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?" is a movie that takes place in a Buddhist hermitage deep in the mountains. The story is pretty simple : the Master is on the brink of death and tries to impart to one of his monks enlightenment about the cycle of life and death.  It's a contemplative movie, much like the Iranian stuff Kiarostami has made popular. So what we need to look at first are the images and the atmosphere. Well, it's very dissapointing. There are sparks of beauty and raw emotion here and there, but most of the images are murky, badly framed, and sometimes a stereotypical "city is bad, rural is good" pap. The DVD itself is TV-quality, and this detracts greatly from the shots. I don't care where (South Korea) or how (with one handheld camera) it was filmed, if it looks crappy, it can't be a good contemplative movie, period.  Not only is the theme of this story based on the bad side of Buddhist teachings - the idea that we must cut ourselves from the world and progress - but the images are not nearly good enough to sustain the movie. The idea was somewhat good, but the execution is terrible. Two stars 
 This version of Crouching Tiger is certain to disappoint most fans of the Ang Lee movie version. The special effects budget is nonexistent. There are scenes where the wires are vividly visible, destroying any believability. Unfortunately, the acting only deepens the disappointment. It is abysmal and amateurish. The story progresses at a jerky pace and the editing is choppy, (probably reflecting the fact that this is condensed from a 15 hour TV version), making it difficult to follow what is going on. Take my advice, save your money! Buy the Ang Lee movie version if you have not already seen it. Watching this horrific and degenerate version is painful and not worth the effort 
 I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it 
 I was amongst a small group of forensic physicists/archaeologists studying the effects of the Tower collapse along Liberty Street and near Ten House. After a year of balking at FEMA video showing the cab of 4 Truck empty during its discovery and excavation, Mr. L. finally admitted in late 2003 that he was in fact not present in New York City during the December 2001 excavation of 4 Truck. This did not prevent him from presenting, in his book, his firsthand eyewitness account of 4 Truck having been stuffed to the gills with stolen jeans, folded and tagged and, according to mr. L's own forensic archaeological interpretation, forming the basis for a broad accusation of looting, by firefighters, as the Towers burned. Much as FEMA video of 4 Truck, showing a complete absence of Mr.L's observed stolen items, proved no obstacle to his accusation of looting... Nor did the April 2002 discovery of 4 Crew's remains at the South Tower elevator banks, with their Hurst cutting tool... nor the two women survivors cut free by 4 Crew, with their Hurst cutting tool. Mr. L. just had to tell his tall, and controversial, and money-making tale - with no indication whatsoever that he gave even an atom of thought to the pain he inflicted upon the widows and children of 4 Truck. I will add that before the Federal government came in with an acceptable protocol against a "dirty bomb" attack, I worked briefly with the crew most likely to be first responders. At one point these men were told that this was not what they had signed on for; and anyone with small children was practically ordered to transfer to another unit. They all stayed. Every one of them. All of the FDNY, PAPD and NYPD people I have worked with (add to this the "civilians" who ran toward the fires, and assisted in the rescue operation)convince me that this city and this country have more good people than bad, and that whatever challenges lie ahead, it is the good people all around us who virtually assure that we shall prevail. During this very same time period, having observed from within how the publishing industry coddled Mr. L., even after it was revealed beyond all serious dispute that he had lied about 4 truck, I have become equally convinced that the only truth Jayson Blair (of "Burning Down My Master's House" fame)ever told was that he found himself being singled out and punished in public for what was, in his industry, "simply business as usual." 
 A few good things, but she's lost her edge AND I find it impossible to identify AT ALL with women who regularly have themselves stitched up here and there, Botoxed, massaged, PT-ed...  Plus I've never made $150,000+ per year so I feel like I live in another cosmos.  Besides, I live in France, where real faces are appreciated.  constance rodrigu 
 The argument that there must be a higher power because there is too much complexity is childish. Just because we believe it to be complex does not require that something as intelligent as a human (or more so) was needed. Check out The Blind Watchmaker by Dawkins for a superior argument.  I also just wanted to note to Cymry9876, and to others, that Antony Flew has not "converted" to theism as has been often claimed. How do I know this? He announced his position to a crowded auditorium at a conference on Secular Humanism in Amherst, NY. Misinformation does not an argument make 
 So for the most part, people have been giving this book good reviews.  My personal opinion is that the book is terrible.  Part of the problem with books of this nature is that historians don't understand biology, and biologists don't understand history.  Kelly's major fault lies in his understanding of plague's biology.  He suggests that the Black Death may have been the reason for the increased frequency of the CCR5-delta32 allele deletion.  He cites an article from 1998.  I doubt he read the article nor anything about the topic further.  In the original journal article (Stephens, et al., [1998], Am. J. Hum. Gen., 62:1507-1515), the Swedes, at 14%, have the highest frequency of the deletion with the Chinese as the lowest.  The Black Death struck China too, so why do so few people have the deletion there?  This same problem plagues (pun very much intended) Scott & Duncan's work (Biology of Plagues, 2001; Return of the World's Greatest Serial Killer, 2005).  What Kelly fails to miss is the abundance of research that shows that Y. pestis doesn't interact with the chemokine receptors, which would have caused the elevation of frequency (the CCR5-delta32 allele deletion confers protection against AIDS).  This is just one of many faults in his presentation of Y. pestis as the causative agent of the Black Death.  He also plagarizes; see p. 25 of his work and p. 24 of Herlihy's The Black Death and the Transformation of the West 
 My wife is an accomplished cook. Like another reviewer from Va - She could not get the Monkey Bread and a few other Recipes to work. She only prepares food from 'scratch' and is very well versed in technique. The book is beautiful but!! 
 Was there a loud boom I didn't hear?  Why oh why isn't this remaindered 
 I read through this book and found it fairly hard to digest. It seems too "academic" for me. An amateur like me probably won't be able to get anything meaningful out of it 
 What do you get when you mix global warming, an artificial intelligence named Gea (instead of Gaia), German idealist Friedrich Schelling, Catholic mystic Teilhard de Chardin, Russian Orthodox mystic philosopher Nikolai Federov, and a guilt-ridden far-future post-human networked mind in need of atonement?  Apparently, you get reams of turgid telling-not-showing exposition followed by soporific sermons about how humans can transcend themselves to become gods (or, as in the case of the net-mind Transcendence, a sort of Godnet 2.0).    Perhaps the soul of this book is the Catholic Priest character, Rosa (of course the Vatican has lightened up on that male Priest thing), who tells us Federov drew on "Marxist historical determinism, socialist utopianism, and deeper wells of Slavic theology and nationalism to come up with a 'Cosmism,' which preached an ultimate unity between man and the universe."  As you can see, Rosa has the soul of a GRE question writer on a bender at the Burning Man festival.  I love a rip-roaring space opera.  I also love mind-bending far-future speculation.  Unfortunately, this book is neither rip-roaring nor mind-bending.  Take a pass 
 this book is absolutely horrible- it's full errors that make you want to tear the book apart from frustration. i can't believe they're still promoting this version. do not buy. don't waste your money. go for either kaplan or princeton review 
 It's not my type of a french movie as it supposed to be. It is too sexually 
 If you don't have access to body building equipment forget it 
 This book consists of a lot of name dropping and stories from the world of golfing greats. In the appendix section Dr. Bob Rotella sums up all his golf wisdom in four pages. Reading these pages you get all the information Dr. Bob Rotella has to offer.  For the average bogey golfer "Golf is not a game of perfect" prescribes working on her short game. From my analysis a lot of bogey golfers lack length to be able to shoot greens in regulation. Most of them eliminated double bogeys by working on their short game. For these players this book is no help at all.  I rated this book with one star and not with zero because Dr. Bob Rotella gives one great advice: create and stick to your pre-shot routine 
 Menstrual bleeding, personal stories of abandonment and enlightenment, blah blah blah, a bunch of rubbish from aging people who were abused and now are better. Join a women's liberation group or a "moon cycle" clan for free, but don't buy this uninformative and uncreative  rubbish that has nothing to do with psychology or liberation 
 I nearly cried when I realized that this was an abridged version. There is no indication in the record. I was really looking forward to these CDs 
 This book has nothing to do with its title.  It is more reminds me book written by the HR manager to company employees on how not to behave in public places.   
 It would have been much better with wide screen presentation, Gigi also lacks quality in soung and the magnificent viewes of Paris are lost.  Of the whole collection, An american in Paris comes as the best picture in this format.  Not worth the mone 
 I agree with the reviewer's title "Merely An Okay Read," in that this story was quite dull and if not for Nicholas & Eleanor it would really have tanked.  This Leander had zilch for personality 
 I was disappointed with this purchase. If you read the book jacket, you have gotten about all of the information out of it that's coming. 
 Caring for fish in a very small bowl like this one is stressful both for the fish and the fishkeeper.   In a small bowl like this, the fish's waste will build up rapidly (espcially since there is no filter). This causes suffering (for example, eye and skin irritation), sickness, and even death. You can try to prevent this by changing the water frequently; however, frequent water changes are also stressful for the fish. (Not to mention a pain for the fishkeeper!)   In addition, the temperature of such a small volume of water will fluctuate rapidly; another source of stress for the fish. You cannot use a heater in a bowl this small.   Bettas are tropical fish. They need a tank heated to 80F; there is no way to safely heat a tank smaller than 5 gallons.   If you'd like to care for a fish, please read some of the excellent websites out there and learn all you can. (Ignore manufacturers websites, since of course they will say their products are great, even crummy products like this one.) Get the largest tank you can afford. If you can't afford a large enough tank, please don't get the fish.   
 I purchased these sheets as an additional set for a new mattress. The mattress probably measures 16" in depth. The first time the sheets were put on the bed, they slightly pulled from the centers, i.e. the fitted sheet really just does not fit and snug very well. After washing, the fit continued to get worse. However, it has never pulled from the mattress around its corners. The original set of sheets that I had on my bed were 500TC (from a different manufacturer), and I was so happy with those that I couldn't wait to receive these new ones. Unfortunately, these 600 TC sheets are no where near as soft as my 500 TC ones, nor are they as soft as some 400 TC ones I purchased thereafter. Overall they are a set of sheets purchased at a very affordable price, but if I had to do it again, I think I'd of been happier not getting these and paying double the price of these for an addition 500 TC set 
 The topic of suburban Christianity is one that deserves attention and thought. And I do agree with the premise of the book--that Christians must not give up on the suburbs. But although this book was well researched, it lacked a fundamental passion to really inspire and encourage the love of God in suburbia. Perhaps that was not the intent, but that is the book we really need to find!  What you are left with is some dry sociological information, mild commentary and a few tentative suggestions like "walk more" or "practice hospitality" or "simplify your life" or "remember how the other half lives" that any non-Christian book about the topic might suggest. I can and do get that type of social commentary from David Brooks. And generally he is more humorous about it too.   God can radically change suburbia through each of us. If we don't believe this, what are we discussing anyway? I believe what is going to get suburban Christians to make eye contact with people and invest in them is a love of God and God's love for people. If we don't care about our neighborhood barista then all the short-term weekend trips to urban missions are more about us than about the people we are suppose to be helping. If we are simplifying our lives to consume less (and save money) but not giving over and above our tithe to charity--again the benefit goes all to us. Ditto for our taking more walks if we don't end up actually talking to anyone new while walking! It's not all about you (or me) the suburban Christian.   To be fair I would probably be less critical of this book if the blurb from whoever Lauren Winner is didn't claim it would be "Provocative...even prophetic." That is what it is precisely NOT. Not provocative enough and not prophetic enough. Bill Hybels' new book "A Walk Across the Room," which talks about making personal connections, is a better guide book for bringing Jesus into your suburb. And as for passion, you can't beat Brennan Manning's "Ruthless Trust" or almost any other book he has written. If you care about this topic, suggest you read Manning to get the passion, pray hard, then do what Hybels says 
  Primarily known for her vampire and historical quasi-horror novels, author Anne Rice has turned her attention towards telling an intriguing story about the early life of Jesus. For Rice, the story is of more than literary value, as the novel captures her turn from a life absent belief in God towards the life of faith. This book covers the part of Jesus' life as he and his family departs Egypt to go back to Israel. Interestingly, the book follows the scholarship of N.T. Wright particularly closely, paying specific attention to the question of Jesus' understanding of himself - something Wright has the intellectual courage and honesty to wrestle with in his series Christian Origins and the Question of God.  The "Author's Note" at the end of the book introduces Rand's journey, including the loving story of her atheist husband of 41 years being diagnosed with brain cancer and dying within 4 months of the diagnosis. This event drove Rice towards a deeper exploration of faith, a journey she was fated to walk. Rice was raised in a Roman Catholic home and left her faith as a young adult, encountering the works of "Kierkegaard, Sartre, and Camus" which fed a part of her inner being that had gone unnourished and unexplored within the church. Her career as a writer drew her towards the occult, no doubt revealing her profound interest in the mythical and supernatural. Her career allowed Rice to placate herself with the tawdry and trivial as she downplayed her more deeply hidden spiritual needs and mystical tendencies with stories of demons and vampires; many a reader is thankful to her for these flights of fancy. During research for another book, she encountered the story of the Jews and began to ask herself how a people so persecuted could survive. This led her to explore Jesus as a Jew, which ultimately led her towards the same question that turned C.S. Lewis from his atheist beliefs towards the life of faith: what other explanation fully answers the question of the origin of Christianity than the resurrection of Jesus?  While wrestling with this question, Rice again encountered the faith of her childhood, reminding us of the truth implicit in the saying "the child is the father of the man". Rice engaged the skeptics of Jesus, although her comments at the end of the book suggest Rice was looking for a myth to believe was true, and in doing so gravitated towards the best of evangelical scholarship (which Wright certainly represents), but seems to quickly pass over the moderate critics of Jesus' divinity such as Marcus J. Borg and John Dominic Crossan. Rice is very much right to disagree with much of the quasi-Jesus scholarship that has arisen in the last 30 years based on scholars so eager to discredit Christianity that they disavow even the idea that the existence of Jesus can be proven at all. But the excesses of members of this community should not inherently discredit every question they are asking, most specifically the essential argument that supernatural events raise to a wholly different standard what is required to prove it occurred than does the required proof of a historical event very much set and bound to the events and continuity of terrestrial occurrences. However, in an important way, Rice's honesty about wrestling with Jesus' identity affords an opportunity for two communities with their own legitimate scholarship to come together in a dialogue over what they do not understand from the other's perspective.  Perhaps Rice is slated to create a round of literature similar in its vision and imagery as did Lewis. American Christianity would benefit from a genuinely unique form of literature as opposed to the pabulum that passes for most Christian literature, the Left Behind series being the best example of this. If this is Rice's intention, her next book in this series is critical as it will need to improve and expand on the inner turmoil taking place within Christ's understanding of himself and his deity. In order to do her story credit, Rice is going to have to develop a line of her writing that has not previously been essential - in addition to telling a good story, she is going to have to wrestle with the inner tension of a character torn between worlds, identities, loves, longings and missions. For me, Christ the Lord came up short in its treatment of the tension in Jesus' inner life, coming short of fully developing the questions Jesus was struggling with as to his identity as God. I could not shake the nagging thought that a God born flesh who does not know he is God is troubling and, frankly speaking, so conflicted as to be quite unhelpful. In asking the question of Christ's awareness (or lack thereof as Rice honestly introduces) of his divinity, Rice would be following through in the most honest and sincere of ways at the implications of Wright's scholarship, which has acknowledged that the Gospels portray a Jesus less than certain of the Messiah-status his modern-day followers are very certain of.  I doubt skeptics will find Wright's treatment of Jesus as a child particularly helpful - for me it only raised the ante of the difficulties and disconnects within Christian theology. By framing the book entirely from the first person-perspective of Jesus as a child, Rice intends for us to appreciate the humanity of Jesus, and the problems of his personal development as he begins to encounter his divinity. But for those attempting to make sense of the "wholly man, wholly God" logic, Rice's literary vehicle only accentuates the difficulty in believing God became flesh, but was not aware at all of his godhood. This struggles to make sense at a literary level, but is the logical consequence of Christian theology - Wright's version of it particularly. One particular prayer of Jesus towards the end of the book captures this profound identity confusion best:      "Lord. Lord, whoever I am, whatever I am, whatever I am meant to be, I am part of this, this world that is all of a flowing wonder - like this music. And you are with us. You are here. You have pitched your tent here, among us. This music is your song. This is your house." (page 273).   We are left with a book that is written in the most approachable and non-offensive of ways, which sincerely wrestles with a question too many Christian theologians refuse to acknowledge: what was it like for God to be born a man and to not know he was God? This is an honest question that Rice deserves much credit for asking. Some will luxuriate in its honesty and the questions it explores, while others will become further perplexed at a part of Christian theology that has never made sense to them - their perplexity being captured quite humanely through the narrative Rice has bestowed to us all. 
 I purchased this based on the numerous reviews here and glowing recommendations elsewhere online, but it has turned out to be the poorest choice and truly the most useless book on drawing I've ever read.  I wish I hadn't ignored the fact that others commented about nearly everything except actual drawing instruction.  I wish my mind had registered the key words analysis and theory in so many others glowing reviews.  If you want to learn to draw, or learn to actually apply lines, mass, tone, balance, proportion, etc. to improve your drawing skills then look elsewhere.  However, if you want to read one author's horribly long winded rambling lectures about how these things influence art, perception, and the psyche then this is the book for you.  This is far more an analysis of drawing as it relates to art than it is a tutorial.  Nearly three hundred pages and you could compress the portions related to applying these ideas to your own drawing down to two dozen pages at most 
 I have very mixed feeling about this tape.  When I bought it, I did not realize it was for new mothers.  I have Cindy's two previous workouts and love them both, so I purchased this without question.  Here are some random thoughts:     --I enjoyed the different length workouts.  You don't always have 45 minutes to workout, even if you aren't a parent.          --These workouts are lead by Kathy Kaehler, not by Cindy like her other tapes.  I found Kathy uninspiring and uninteresting.  Cindy does not seem as familiar with this workout as she is with the Radu ones.  She is more "window dressing" in this video.          --The amount of repetitions for the movements varies greatly, which I found very annoying.          --The warm-up and cool-down are very, very short, even on the 40 minute Workout "C".        --The music will put you to sleep.  I suggest hitting the "mute" button on your TV and listening to your own music.  If you are a new mother or beginner, this is a good tape to ease you into a workout routine.  However, I believe you will quickly outgrow it.    
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 If you pick up a mystery at the grocery store, you don't expect Hemingway.  Or even Russ Francis.  But this is really just like a bad novelization of a middling episode of "Law and Order CI".  The good men are all craggy and strong and sensitive to women.  The women are all good unless they're hookers or junkies.  All of them, at some point, beat up or kill a man.  The bad men had bad experiences with their mothers. Wives are more successful than their husbands, who are as petulant as a teenager with a used Chevrolet.  In all fairness, there is a decent plot, but it has petechial hemorrhage from the ligature of Dr-Phil-level psychology and daytime-drama characters.  The least you expect from a cheap mystery is that it will be better than the average police-procedural tv show.  This one fails the test.  Save your $5 and watch reruns of Bones or NCIS 
 Step by step we are moving to the truth. The fiction is banal. Hence - one star for the book. The reality is amazing. Hence - 5 stars for the next book on the Ames-Colby case. The next book will be based on Dekov's memoirs 
 Londonstani starts out great, with a realistic (realistic-feeling to an outsider, anyway) look at a newly-affluent youth culture getting in trouble in London, along the lines of Quadrophenia or Absolute Beginners (the baddie is a desi Vendice Partners). The first half is great and original, with dialogue reminiscent of The Committments, and the plot thickens nicely, but by the end it dissolves into Scarface cliches and a crying-in-a-rainy-cemetery scene. In the last couple chapters, the plot gets less and less realistic (a typical situation where anyone but a fictional character would just leave town, commit suicide, or go to the police) but still holds together well, and the book would get four stars if it wasn't completely ruined by a cheap, irrelevant M. Night Shamalayn surprise-ending in the last couple pages that negates the signifigance of the rest of the story 
 Bag was well made, but too small.  Can't put much in it.  Nice well-made leather bag.  If it was three times bigger it would be a perfect. 
 Got a free copy of *Shadow Man* and it's no surprise, for me at least, that nothing has changed in James Doss' appalling goulash of sophomoric humor, unbelieveable plotting, and comicbook characters.   There's more of that special sensibility that spews food over, "I know you are, but what am I?" The chief of police is asked if he was "discreet" about coming to a restaurant, and he says, "Yes, I came in down the chimney" and then, in case we don't get it (These are the jokes, folks!), muses that the restaurant owner doesn't get it. I laughed 'till snot got in my ears. And then, and then, there's that one other part, it's Sooooooo funny!!!!!  A woman falls in love at first sight with the hero, who of course falls back at once, at least until the scene is over. Muses she, after exchanging four or five words with him, "If only I had met this wonderful human being before I gave myself to my oaf of a husband!" But face it, every female human in Dossland falls in  love at first sight with Charlie Moon (used to be Scott Parris, but the franchise took off when Charlie got to be head cutout), who obligingly falls in love with them, not just stupid ole' lust, understand, but gut-wrenching, weeping eternal love. Just like real life. Why only last week at the market, a woman looked at me and I looked at her, perfect strangers, and we both thought, as if coincidentally, "Him/Her! The one I've always wanted. Oh my glory. My eternal love!!!! Darling!!!!!!! No wait! That one, next to him/her!"  A murder occurs to get things rolling that is so hopelessly stupid and predictable you will groan repeatedly for a good ten pages after. A woman is shot to death in a restaurant, and the restauruant owner, discovering this unfortunate incident, worries that the other diners might be upset if they see the corpse. No doubt. First thing any Doss human would think of upon noticing that one his customers had been shot right between the eyes and gotten icky brains on the walls. And the police chief to whom he expresses this emotional commonplace simply accepts it as normal. And there is some confusion because the "crack marksman" who shot her precisely between the eyes actually meant to kill a diner at another table. No, I can't explain that more clearly. Well, let me try. He was aiming at someone else and hit her as if she were the target, a perfect bull's eye.... No, I give up.  The "conclusion" of this farrago is so utterly unsatisfying that you will dread, among other things, the possibility that Doss thinks his new villian is so neato that he should be brought back in another book. The "other book" is out, and one can only hope that Doss' attention span is as mature as his sense of humor.  The popularity of these moronic novels is a sad commentary on contemporary literacy. Read Kirk Mitchell, Margaret Coel, and the master even in his failing years, Tony Hillerman. Give this crud a flush 
 To be honest, I couldn't get through it.  It was that BAD!  The arguements in this book were so poorly thought out that the reader is left with no idea of what the hell was going on.  Buy this book only if you have money to waiste and you can't find anyone else to give it to 
 Norman Klein is a professor and he writes like one! Meaning he doesn't seem to want to express his ideas simply because that would not be learned. This is ironic when he bemoans the powerful using "speacial effects" to deceive the huddled masses, that he couldn't write more clearly 
 Having read Kerry Downes' standard monographs on Hawksmoor, Du Prey's "Architecture and Theology" is very disappointing. Du Prey does not, to begin, bring the book to its logical conclusion; despite commencing with a gushing account of Anglican Divines in Augustan England (Atterbury and Aldrich, though not, rather surprisingly, Sacheverall), the way in which contemporary religious thought might have conditioned the form of the churches built is inconclusive and not argued with the conviction that made an old article on the matter by Du Prey himself (ie., 'The Basilicas of the Primitive Christians') worthwhile. Furthermore, broad, out-of-context and misleading generalisations (such as a description of the Tory party of 1711 as 'right-wing') mixed with pockets of narrative make the book extremely irksome to read.  As if that were not bad enough, Du  Prey proves himself a brazen and misguided name-changer: St. George-in-the-East becomes 'St. George's-in-the-East', whilst St. Alfege, Greenwich, is nicely modernised as St. Alphege (which is, in fact, in dioscean records, a completely different church!).  These observations might seem pedantic, but such mistakes are quite surprising from a Professor of Architectural History.   Du Prey does not mention the churches of Gibbs (St. Mary-le-Strand, St. Martin-in-the-Fields), Archer (St. John Smith Square, Westminster, St. Paul, Deptford) or John James (St. George Hanover Sqaure), even though the latter collaborated on St. John Horselydown and St. Luke Old Street with Hawksmoor himself! Neither of the churches, not surprisingly, are studied at all.  This is a flaw which Kerry Downes highlighted in a review of the book; it ought to have elicited a little caution on my part, because "Architecture and Theology" is definately not worth the asking price 
 ........from reading Danielle Steel.  Here's the book:  three bachelors meet three women.  They all break up, they all end up happily ever after.  BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.  I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.  Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel.  My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers.  THAT'S sad 
 Oh yes I remember the Bush copresidency and presidency. Those arms for hostages, or broken tax promises don't escape your mind too easily. Neither does the long 1990-91 recession, or the wag the dog war in Iraq, against a former Reagan era ally. In this book, Shrub Senior hides his true colors and attempts to show a man with "decency" to contrast to the "immoral" Clinton at the time of publishing, in 1999, and to help his dimwitted son get elected. It didn't fool me. One look inside, and I knew everything had the truth value of "Read my lips: NO NEW TAXES". His 1000 points of light is a thousand lines of lies. Save your money. If you wanna read about people like Bush, read Pinocchio 
 I puchased the LS 100's to get a decent speaker for a great price. I was disappointed. I knew the bass response would not be astonding but it was almost non existant. The midrange and the highs are scratchy.   I would not recommend the speakers for anything other than talk radio 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 In seeking to develop my own grant writing course, I reviewed 20 books on Amazon.  I was sold on this one by its extremely high Amazon.com Sales Rank...probably the highest of this category.  Nevertheless, I was shocked and taken aback by a comment on the introduction page, that harkened back to my eighth-grader days: "You'll learn that in grant writing you especially need to cultivate two abilities: meeting deadlines and following directions."    Despite the obvious comprehensiveness of the materials presented in the book from Ms Burke-Smith's experience, I don't know who's responsible for the talking-down attitude presented here.    This is my first EVERYTHING title, and I don't know if all EVERYTHING titles are like this, or if it's from award-winning business writer Ms Tremore.  All I know is after getting such an Introduction, what reader would wish to proceed into the book's depths with that kind of attitude by one's hoped-for mentors? 
 We all know that Buzzo has the voice of an Angel and the fingerwork of Paginni, Dale has the delicate Jazz technique, but Joe? This has got to be the worst cd I've ever bought.. What's up? This has to stay in the collection, but I would tell anyone to buy this cd last if you are going for a complete Melvins collection.. 
 I was very dissapointed by this book.  I bought it hoping for some inspiration or something fresh I could use in my next short film.  I found nothing.  It should be titled Great Camera Moves Every Filmmaker Already Knows (and some ordinary ones).  I'm not normally someone to criticize other peoples work and put things down, but I honestly felt like I wasted my money on this book.  It is clearly a book for absolute beginners in film and I think it should state this on the cover somewhere.  Give this one a miss unless you are a beginner 
 This book says that the Nazis were Jeffersonian democrats.  
 Murky:   In his book, 1984, Orwell described a contrived language he called "newspeak", designed to render politically incorrect ideas inexpressible. But before Orwell there were Russell and Whitehead, who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence. As Whitehead wrote in his "Foreword" to Quine's Ph.D. dissertation titled A System of Logic: logic shapes metaphysical thought.   Thus in his "On Universals" Quine argued that in the Russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as "entities". And he co-authored with Goodman "Steps toward a Constructive Nominalism", a nominalist manifesto, in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or "platonists" depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities. I believe that anyone who says that universals are "referenced" or who uses the phrase "abstract entities" fully deserves to be labeled a Platonist.   But Loux uses the rhetoric from the Russellian nominalist newspeak. In the "search inside this book" screens at this Amazon web site the reader will find him reporting (p. 20) that realists say universals are shared "entities" and are "referents" of predicates.   I ask Loux: What happened to signification? The symbolic logician Alonzo Church recognized sense (i.e. signification) as well as denotation (i.e. reference) in the functional (i.e. predicate) calculus. I ask Loux: What happened to supposition, which distinguishes reference from signification? In his book titled Meaning and Necessity Rudolf Carnap explicitly affirms that intensions (i.e. significations) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization (i.e. reference), and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects. I ask Loux: Since the demise of logical positivism does the Russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else? Is Loux trying to appear contemporary with the Russellian rhetoric? I see murky writing.   Muddled:   Loux is sympathetic to Aristotle and unsympathetic to Quine, the pragmatic realist, who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism, and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing.   Ontological relativity started as an analogy: Quine relativized ontology as Einstein relativized time. Einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of Newton's absolute time, and he rejected Lorentz's making relativistic time apparent time. Likewise Heisenberg invoked this Einstein precedent for his own realistic Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory's positing of duality and indeterminacy. Today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition, nonlocality and Calabi-Yau spaces in eleven dimensions. Quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs.   Realism is a natural, primordial, irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories. On the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial. It is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history. It is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories.   But in Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic and in this book Loux rejects ontological relativity, and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity "anti-Realism". In fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism, but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change. I do not find this book contemporary. Loux's "Realism - anti-Realism" locution is a false dichotomy. I see muddled thinking.   Marginalized:   While a student I found Notre Dame's philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism. When I left their graduate school of philosophy I took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking. I see in this book a textbook in Notre Dame metaphysics for Notre Dame philosophy students.   Readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this Amazon site.

 This book by Timothy White is a shallow delve into the life of reggae legend Bob Marley. The book promises to deliver on details of his early life, his rise to stardom, and his death in the crushing grip of cancer. However, Mr. White spends far too much time on the small and irrelevant details of Marley's early years and leaves the reader wanting more and getting less. The book progresses with minor details loosely strung together with trival information and little 'meat' in the scope of the life of one of the most influential musicians of all time. Overall, I would have to say that this is one of the worst books about Marley that I have ever read and I think that though he began with good intentions, Mr. Timothy White did not deliver on his promises to fulfill the reader with knowledge about the life of Bob Marley 
 This book had several good tidbits of information to help any single parent.  I'm happy to have read it, however there are many opinions of Kevin Leman's that are not backed by facts.  I would advise anyone who reads this book to pay attention to the practical advice, but ignore the opinions - some of which lead me to question the sanity of the writer - such as "boys should live with moms and girls are better off with dads."  I don't think he'd be saying that if he had a little girl ask him to go bra shopping or bring up the topic of menstruation 
 the author seems to write backwards. it requires too much effort to unscrambe 100 words to get at the 5 meaningful words. i personally dont have the time to suffer through it 
 why ? because it has good sound dts hd 5.1 master lossless audio the picture quality will not blow you away it just seams flat and washed out and this just isnt a good movie i like tim burton and mark wahlberg but this movie was done wright the first tim 
 The collection of stories in this anthology are pitiful not horrific.  This book opens with 90 pages of an intro that provides a chronology of "events" for the genre for the year.  An absolute waste of paper and ink.  Neither interesting nor relevant to a good horror story.  Finally the book opens with the first of "The Best New Horror", a triffling werewolf story that left me wanting.  Better stories are told by 6-year olds.  But I had faith and kept reading and was further disappointed by the quality of the stories that followed.  Don't waste your time, your money or your shelf space.  This book is not worth any of them 
 Who lives outside in barns, begging for food? Well, in a book called The Midwife's Apprentice, Alyce, aslo known as Dung or Brat does. Since she is starving, she asks people for jobs she can do. Aluce finally convines a midwife, called Jane, to give her a job. Alyce also tells Jane if she works, she wants food in return. Jane agrees to the deal, and that's when Alyce journey begins.   I didn't really like this book since it was boring. Even though the book was dull, I think Karen Cushman did a good job of expressing emotions of the characters, like when boys called Alyce names. I also feel a connection to the book. When Aluce didn't do an important assignment, she felt ashamed. I  feel ashamed when I don't do something important properly. Karen Cushman has also written other books like Catherine Called Birdy. Really, I wouldn't reccomend this book to to anybody since it was boring. But I think people could learn from the moral of the story: which is hard work pays of.   
 I liked this book all the way through the trial, but the post-trial revelation was, at the very least, ridiculous.  It did not come across as a "Sixth Sense" shocker but a cheap shot out of left field.  It was stupid and didn't fit with the story, at all.  The author didn't need it and should have tied up the loose ends a different way.  I can't even look back on the book and see how it all it.  It didn't.  Throughout the book, even alone with his own thoughts, Tom didn't reveal his true character.   This book was a huge disappointment!  I would not recommend that anyone waste their time.  In the end, when all is "revealed" nothing makes sense.  No matter how hard you might try - it doesn't fit, at all!  
 I find Graham Greene to be almost unreadable. I know that this is going to be considered near blasphemous, since literary critics have heaped such praise upon him and so many reviewers here have done likewise.   However, in a word, I find him depressing. His characters suffer from interminable analysis of their every thought and action. The larger story is merely a vehicle for these internal monologues that, frankly, I don't find particularly insightful or interesting. It was V. S. Pritchett who first remarked about Greene's 'perverse and morbid tendencies'. While Greene is no doubt highly intelligent and capable of a very high level of writing, the end result, for me, is something very unpleasant.   I first read 'The Heart Of The Matter'. God, what an endlessly depressing scene! Nor was there any particular character I could sympathize with or even care about. In spite of my negative reaction to this highly praised work, I thought I would give him another try with 'Orient Express' (a.k.a., 'Stamboul Train'), thinking that in this 'entertainment' as Greene called it I would actually be, well, entertained. Instead, I get a trainload of depressing characters whose every thought is scrutinized to an excruciating degree.   Example (from Myatt's suspicions about his business dealings):  'It was odd. He had chosen the samples with particular care. It was natural of course that even Stein's currants should not all be inferior, but when so much was suspected, a further suspicion was easy. Suppose, for example, Mr. Eckman had been doing a little trade on his own account, had allowed Stein some of the firm's consignment of currants, in order temporarily to raise the quality, had, on the grounds of that improved quality, indeed, induced Moults' to bid for the business. Mr. Eckman must be having uneasy moments now, turning up the time-table, looking at his watch, thinking that half Myatt's journey was over. Tomorrow, he thought, I will send a telegram and put Joyce in charge; Mr. Eckman shall have a month's holiday. Joyce will keep an eye on the books, and he pictured the scurrying to and fro, as in an ants' nest agitated by a man's foot, a telephone call from Eckman to Stein or from Stein to Eckman, a taxi ordered here and dismissed there, a lunch for once without wine, and then the steep office steps and at the top of them the faithful rather stupid Joyce keeping his eye upon the books. And all the time, at the modern flat, Mrs. Eckman would sit on her steel sofa knitting baby clothes for the Anglican mission, and the great dingy Bible, Mr. Eckman's first deception, would gather dust on its unturned leaf.'  Lord have mercy. This stuff is like fingernails on a chalkboard!   William Golding called Green 'the ultimate twentieth-century chronicler of consciousness and anxiety'. This does not, however, make for entertaining reading. Greene's writing is an examination of the human condition totally devoid of lightness, humor (at least as I understand the word) or romance. His characters are an unpleasant, unhappy bunch.  Ultimately all his writing reveals is the real Graham Greene.  
 A confused film with stereotypes and a self-deceiving message that confounds statutory rape with a mid-life spiritual awakening. Check out the fantastic Aussie film from 1987, BLISS, (directed by Ray Lawrence) and you will see how AB is a weak, mixed-up reworking (from a writer who cut his teeth in TV sitcoms). The very last scene of AB is the true tip-off to the reality of the rip-off, compare the camera's heavenwards pullback and Spacey's final voiceover monologue. The lovely poetry of BLISS' last scene will, if you have even a vague pulse, bring real soul-tears to your eyes. You tell me.   PS -   I was moved at the final images of Annette Benning's wailing in the closet and her brief, gleeful smile on the Tilt-a-Whirl (black and white film is so underrated). So, there's a couple of stars for that 
 This is an OK CD. Not one of his better efforts. The best song on this CD, Boats To Build was of course not written by Jerry Jeff but by Guy Clark. It is very dissapointing to see Jerry Jeff's lack of original songwriting in recent years. His best stuff has always been songs not written by him but atleast he used to write a decent song once in awhil 
 Decided to buy the DeLonghi heater, as recommended by ConsumerReports.  On being powered on, the unit oscillated but neither fan nor heater started up.  I did make sure the 'safety trip' was not activated.  This is located below the unit, designed to switch it off in case it toppled over.  In short, I put in the effort, to make sure I wasn't doing anything stupid, since the unit 'looked' fine - nothing obviously broken.    A prior reviewer seems to have had similar problem, but thought Amazon's package handling might be the culprit.  In my case, the packaging on arrival was excellent.  Return procedure for Amazon was surprisingly smooth, they even refunded the shipping fee for sending it back. 
 Not very useful if you want to study for maths level 1/2.only useful for part time end moment practice but not worth its money 
 This is not a book that will enlighten you. I have many books on body language, and his one is the least informative. 
 I couldn't skip through the tracks fast enough.  As the vomit started filling my esophagus, I couldn't help but wonder "how could something be so bad."  Guero was great, the bands were talented in their own rights...  I started with an open mind and ended up with an empty stomach.  
 I am sorry, but who ever thought this book was in any way helpful in teaching people to "Price it Yourself" was oh so wrong.  I was so excited about getting the book and when I opened it to find nothing but page after page of words with only a few drawings to back them up... I was, oh so sadly, disappointed.  I guess it might work IF you were to come across the exact item(s) discribed throughout the book.  It's like trying to read an encyclopidia, only not as informative.  I tried to get through it, but put it down after five or so pages.  It's off to the Goodwill, so if you want it, look for it there 
 It's this simple:  I won't be buying this.    Give me "YOU CAN'T DO THAT ON TELEVISION" and "SALUTE YOUR SHORTS".  Please complete "CLARISSA" and "PETE AND PETE". I'll buy those.    I've already written out a check for what these will cost.  Now I wait.... 
 The Internet doesn't allow one to write faster; it simply sends the message faster. It is another stage in the development of commerce, not a new medium of communication. Opportunists are so happy to have something new to perch on, but beware: you've got to entertain to get away with making a living making something out of nothing. This doesn't 
 I turned to this book as possible first-hand source material for a seminar on violence and enculturation in modern America.  What did I come away with?  A whining, immature rant about how things aren't "his fault".  Society made them do it.  Instead of the lucid expose that so many of these reviews promise, this book presents us with a whining, tattling exercise that does no service to anyone or anything, and serves only to feed the self-serving desires of the author.    The prose is itself slang-ridden and nearly impossible to read.  One wonders whether this is the work of the co-author, trying to make the piece seem edgy and relevant.  It ultimately acts only as an off-putting, succeeding in alienating the reader, making it difficult for us to form a closeness: though we might wish to.  A tragedy such as this is deserving of a far better voice than is provided by this book. 
 Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Are You Being Served?  I have most of the episodes memorized but this is a total rip off.  The episodes shown here are available with the regular series DVDs and the quality is very poor.  The "On Set Interview" lasts about 4 minutes and involves some reporter asking cast members if they like being on the show. DUH!  Get the series, the movie and the sequel but forget this thing 
 What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about 
 in the hills of beverly.  Spoiled rich bratty kids snorting their lives up their plastic surgeonized noses.  How sweet.  James Spader was good as the sleazy drug pusher, what happened to him, he had real potiential to be a fine actor.   Robert Downey,Jr. is terrific in any part he takes.  Jamie Gertz reminds me of Tori Spelling, she has to be related to some big shot, how else does she get hired? She can't act and she's not even pretty or even busty.  Like Pam Anderson, would anybody remember her without her big oversized boobies?   I doubt it.  Enjoy 
 Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of fiction, but regardless, good fiction is engrossing with dynamic characters and a well-told story.  With that said, Maguire has a strong command of language and is a great writer when you examine his technique.  However, I DESPISED this story...I am familiar with the original Wizard of Oz story, and the potential of turning a classic on its head was alluring to me in addition to all of the attention that the musical is getting.  In spite of my better judgment after the first 100 pages, I kept reading.  I hated this book.  It is one of the worst stories I have read in years.  I am so mad that I paid for this.  Even worse, I wish that I had not given it a chance and saved myself 400 pages of a warped, pretentious story that attempts to question the nature of good and evil.  It fails miserably 
 I can't help but wonder if this film wasn't made more from an excuse to cash in on the popularity of John Goodman at the time of this film than an honest desire to portray the baseball icon.  It would certainly explain the film's inaccuracies and rushed feel.  I remember that around that time (late 80's, early 90s), Goodman seemed to be fairly popular.  Can it be coincidence that somebody wanted to make a film about Babe Ruth at around the same time Goodman started receiving recognition in Hollywood?  Honestly, I don't think so.  At any rate, Goodman is miscast as Ruth.  For one thing, Ruth wasn't really fat; more like broad and stocky.  He was quite athletic and able to play the field -  remember, there was no such thing as a designated hitter back then.  In other words, offense isn't the only part of baseball; Ruth played defense too.  Does this film ever show Ruth in the outfield?  Can't say for sure because I didn't really watch the entire thing, but it's hard to imagine paunchy John Goodman fielding fly balls.  The other thing is Goodman is simply unlikeable as Ruth.  As we can see from film footage (including Pride of the Yankees), the real Ruth was energetic and charismatic.  Goodman's Ruth is simply loud, crass and grating 
 It may have been a good book in its day, but is far too dated for a modern reader.  There are many far more up-to-date type books about the war in the Pacific.  The "Diary" is just that and gives too little detail about the actual battles or men who fought them.  He states that there was a "bombing" or "strafing" by the Japs, but he gives no further detail.  If you want an actual, detailed, first-person account of the many battles in the south Pacific, try "With the Old Breed" or "Into the Rising Sun".  Both are excellent accounts of battles in the south Pacific during WWII 
 Here me out:  maybe it is b/c of the book I just finished (the 3rd policeman) that made me edgy for a little more cohesiveness - a novel if you will.  This book is all in the title:  FRAGMENTS.  Its a uniquely presented book that discusses verbs and actions that we find in 'love'.  From what I did manage to read, it was an eye opener, but I just couldn't get past the way it was presented.  He took several famous authors and took from their works and his life experience and manifested these chapters on the chosen word (chpt one is 'engulf').  I felt like I was reading a REFERENCE book for a poetry class.  Good luck 
 That this dismal collection of stories comes from a former Pulitzer winner is most disheartening.  The problem is not the novel premise of using tabloid headlines to launch stories, rather, it is the complete lack of insight and imagination that is at work here.  Oh, some of the pieces are clever, milking their conceits for some easy laughs, but never does this come close to the true vision of Butler's prizewinning A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain.  While trying to bring love and understanding to these misunderstood souls, Butler manages only feeble insights, the worst of which, as in "Help Me Find My Spaceman Lover," descend into cheapness.  The best story in the collection, "Jealous Husband Returns in the Form of Parrot," is a rehashing of "Love," a story from Good Scent.  Even worse, Butler's prose, usually not a problem, clunks over attempts at the various dialects ranging from a Britisher on the Titanic to the Alabaman searching for her spaceman.  Hopefully, this book was an attempt to cash in, but if not, Butler has betrayed the promise of possibly great write 
 The book," The International Jew," a collection of articles, portents to present a scientific analysis of a problem, both the problem is stated and defined by the Author. The book is clearly aimed at an audience that neither requires, seeks, nor needs any substantiation of statements or claims made regardless of how devastating their effects may be on the affected.  If these articles had been submitted to a scientific body for publication, they would have been rejected out-of-hand being devoid of any Bibliography or References, making it impossible to verify any of the statements. However, even without this reference material, the contradictions found in this text are so obvious that it is impossible to view it as a serious undertaking.  To be specific, on page 8 it is stated:  "The single description ...of Jews ...is this: he is in business. It may be only gathering rags and selling them, but he is in business...the Jew is supremely gifted for business." And on page 14: "...wherever they [the Jews] wandered, the center of business seemed to go with them."  Yet on pp 33-34 one finds: "Associated with Columbus in the voyage were at least five Jews. Luis de Torres, interpreter; Marco, the surgeon; Bernal, the physician; Alonzo de la Calle. and Gabriel Sanchez. The astronomical instruments and maps which the navigators used were of Jewish origin." Of the surgeon and the physician only the first names are known. How, then was their religion ascertained? In fact, how and from whom was any of this information obtained? Here we have an Interpreter, a Jew; a Surgeon, a Jew; a Physician, a Jew; and the Navigational Instruments and Maps all made by Jews. WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE IN-BUSINESS JEWS?  Is one to believe that in all of Spain the only Surgeon to be found turned out to be a Jew? Is one to believe that in all of Spain the only Physician to be found also turned out to be a Jew? Is one to believe that in all of Spain the only Interpreter to be found turned out to be another Jew? And in all of Spain, makers of Navigational Instruments and Maps, all turned out to be Jews?  Did the Surgeon sail with Columbus because he was planning to peddle surgical instruments to the ship's crew? Did the Physician come aboard to push cough syrup and band-aids at exorbitant prices, having captive consumers at his mercy? And the Interpreter, did he arrive with a truckload of dictionaries counting on making a huge profit from selling these books to the sailors who had money in their pockets and no place to spend it?  Or would it be more reasonable to assume that, for a voyage of this gravity, Columbus picked the very best he could find. Now, if that is the case, then it would appear that the "supremely gifted [Jew] for business" turns out to be equally supremely gifted for Languages, Surgery, General Medicine, and the Manual Skills required to create navigational instruments and maps.  Perhaps one other example may prove to be of interest. In this book there are drawn constant comparisons between Jew and Gentile when no comparison on this basis is possible. Whether one considers a Jew a member of a specific race or a specific religion or both, a Gentile is neither: He is not the member of a specific race or the member of a specific religion and, obviously, he cannot belong to both of them. From the point-of-view of a Jew, a Gentile is anybody who is not a Jew. From a Mormon's point-of-view, anybody who is not a Mormon is a Gentile, which leads to the interesting and perhaps even amusing conclusion that from a Mormon's point of view, A JEW IS A GENTILE!  Last, but by no means least, once it becomes clear that the "The International Jew" is based on "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion," the need for proving discrepancies disappears. For decades now a number of independent Historical Scholars have shown that "The Protocols ..."are fictitious minutes of meetings that never took place.  Since a Theory based on an erroneous Hypothesis is an erroneous Theory, therefore, a book or series of articles, based on a fictitious account, consequently is itself a fictitious account of the 2nd order.  One may ask, how is it possible that so many have taken these statements for GOSPEL. The only answer I have to offer is this: " There are none so blind, as those who do not wish to see!" There are none so deaf, as those who do not wish to hear! 
 After reading all the reviews this book had I was very surprise to see how terrible this book is.  Make sure not to buy this book I was very very disapointed, it is supposed to be for an intrudoctory level, but this book is way below that, the only person who should by this book is someone who has never used a computer.  This is very disapointing considerint other Sam publication. Botom Line DON BUY THIS BOO 
 I bought this so that it would be easier to clean up after my cats instead of taking out the vaccume every time. It works on small stuff like Cat litter and sometimes on cat food but not on anything bigger than that. Doesn't trap much hair at all. The thing I was dissapointed in was that the catch tray was much too small for the jobs I need to do. My cats spill a fair amount of litter around their boxes and are messy with their food. I have to change the pick up pad once or twice just to clean up all the stuff that ends up on the floor. It's pretty much better just to get out the vaccume and do the job that way. I think they could improve this product by allowing larger items to be caught up in the catch tray and making the catch tray a bit larger 
 A well written book but let's not forget what these people where in prison for. They where in prison for having murdered or helped to murder other people agree or disagree with what they stood for the rule of law has to be upheld no matter what. These people had a choice and they made the wrong one they where not hero's only fools to themselves and there so called cause 
 I thought it would be really cool to be part of a society that wore red hats in public.  Being part of a club where one could identify another club member because they are wearing a certain item of clothes while in public, fascinates me.  But then I started reading the book.  I found the characters non-believable.  The rules of the club, do overs and make overs were just too restrictive.  Life is not about squashing dialogue with your friends because you are too uncomfortable or too polite to say what is on your mind.  The scene about catching Harold in the act truly stretched my imagination.  The amounts of money thrown around boggled my mind.  And the ending?  It reminded me of the last episode of Seventh Heaven 
 The first half ropes you in...the second half is boring to the point that I had to skim through it. Don't waste your time 
 Bland, bland, and more bland.  It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark.  With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable.  And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way.  It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity 
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 While Mr. Fair, perhaps in an attempt to appear neutral, does take a few shots at Hoffman, it is painfully obvious that the author has more than a neutral fascination for York BBC and Bob Hoffman.  Those of us who were in the Iron Game  know that Hoffman did it for his ego alone. And York BBC under the aegis of the AAU did not promote the first Mr. America. It would be more accurate to say that the York boys via the AAU plagerized the Mr. America contest, stole it from the promoters who had started it in 1939.  The first legitimate bodybuilding contests were actually held in Europe in the 1930's by the same people who would form NABBA in 1950.   A World's Most Perfectly Developed Man contest was held in NYC back in 1920 and was won by Angelo Sicliano aka Charles Atlas. And the people who started NABBA, ran bodybuilding shows in Great Britian and throughout Europe in the 1930's.  York Barbell didn't start bodybuilding and weightlifting competitions, they merely jumped on the bandwagon.  Hoffmans sole interest was to sell magazines and his crappy supplements. Hoffman made himself the US Olympic Weightlifting coach which is interesting since he neither ever competed nor trained. It was all part of an incredible hoax.  Hoffmans magazine Strength & Health was a ripoff of the British publication Health & Strength (sound familiar) who were also sponsors of the NABBA Mr. Universe, the real Mr. Universe Contest won by greats like yorks own John C. Grimek, Steve Reeves, Reg Park, Bill Pearl, Arnold Schwarzenneggar, Frank Zane, Serge Nubret, Robby Robinson, Chris Dickerson, Bertil Fox and Boyer Coe.  AAU events were horribly run. The first show I went to was in Scranton, Pa. back in 1968. The Jr. National Powerlifting Championships and Jr. Mr. USA. Massive disorganization! The contest was held in a YMCA that had to be at least 50 years old and in the heart of downtown. There were only 7 physique contestants and only one who was of national caliber. Contestants posed under a flood light that was clamped onto to a basketball hoop! 5 years later the same promoters held the Sr, National Powerlifting Championships and AAU Mr. USA Contest. This would go down as the worst national AAU event ever! Seveal athletes got seriously injured due to bad equipment and bad spotters. Several national records were not set because of either horrible officiating or spotters grabbing the bar during the lift. During the physique show, the flood light that was attached to a basketball hoop fell just missing a contestant! The bodybuilding show was more of who was the promoters top vitamin salesman rather than who had the best physique. This would be the last national show or major show of any importance to be held in Scranton, Pa. It was terrible even by AAU standards!  But this was all so typical of the AAU events during that time. Poorly organized and political. Other AAU events were only slightly better. Even the top shows  held in York and sponsored by the man himself, Bobby Boy Puffman were held in High School Auditoriums of only average size and no air conditioning during the hot summertime.  The bottom line is that Hoffman did this all for himself. Yeah, I know it's not nice to talk about the deceased, but Mr. Hoffman was not as loved as the author likes to make it look and York was not the powerhouse that the author tries to make it look either. Remember this was in the early days of the sport and comparing to what York Barbell had going on back then to the Iron Game, especially bodybuilding and powerlifting events today is like comparing a 1968 Chevy to a 2005 Lexus! Sort of like comparing a small Mom and Pop store to Wal-Mart. No Comparison.  And let's get off this nonsense that the AAU Mr. America was like the Mr. Olympia of it's day. I think the real curiosity factor was who would get ripped off each year. The best guys lost and would either retire or switch to the IFBB or Dan Luries now defunct organization. The top champions were in the IFBB, even  back in the 1960's.   Even as far back as 1960, the best built men in America competed in the IFBB or NABBA events. Prior to the forming of the IFBB in the USA, many American bodybuilders would fly over to London, England to compete in the NABBA Mr. Universe and win over the AAU Mr. America Winners!  And then there was that nonsense that York BBC pulled in the 1956 AAU Mr. Universe contest in Virginia Beach, Va.   This book is not totally accurate as those of us who have followed the sport for many years know. Hoffman did more to hold the sport back than to help it. That is the sports of bodybuilding and powerlifting. Hoffmans only real love was Olympic Weightlifting.  Notice that the AAU does not run bodybuilding events anymore? Some people blame Weider and the forming of the NPC back in 1982 for that. Perhaps so, but all Weider and the NPC did to the AAU was what the AAU had been doing to bodybuilding and the Iron Game for over 40 years! And the NPC took bodybuilding further than the AAU could have ever hoped to. I hate to think where the sport would be today if it were still in the hands of the York crew!   The Arnold Classic sould probably be held in a small high school auditorium with perhaps 700 people attending and unsymetrical olympic weightlifters turned bodybuilders who represented York BBC winning over great physiques. Thank God for the NPC, the IFBB and Joe Weider! And thank God for the new powerlifting federations that were formed. Although today, there are too many.   Thank God control of the sport was taken away from Hoffman, York BBC and the AAU.  I respect Mr. Fair for his opinion and his desire to make money, but this book is not all that accurate.  
 For the record I have never bought one of these pieces of junk they try to pass off as music and never WILL!!!! I hope you are all happy! You've officially tainted some of the best music ever with your high pitched pre-puberty voices! Yellow Submarine can never and shouldn't have ever been done by anyone but THE BEATLES!!!!!!!!! in the future please leave the singing to those peoples with some taste and artistry! Who is the guy trying to be Ual Mc Cartney in Here comes the sun! I normall ysing this song to make myself feel better: but now I'll only be able to think of those freakishly squeaky voices!GOOD JOB(I only gave it a star because my review wouldn't have been put up if i didn't 
 We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...  Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the  see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry. 
 I got this hoping to find some new ideas on how to help more people get our services.  Mr Girad is talked about quite highly in sales circles.  I commend him for his acheivements.  This book may work well for small ticket  items, but I personally found it offensive.  It treats prospects as if they  are incapable of having independent thought, and enjoy being manipulated.   The single redeeming idea I got from the book was how well he kept in touch  with past sales.  By the way...Since Mr Girad did so well in his sales  career, I would recommend to him to hire someone to read his books for him  in the future.  His monotone voice is distracting 
 The idea is good. The characters are really good, with a few exceptions. BUT.   1) This book's plot is extremely repetetive. "Oh my gosh, she's committed the unpardonable; they have not choice but to curse her with death." OVER and OVER again. Ayla breaking the "most sacred-est rule ever" and then mysteriously NOT getting in serious trouble for it consumes the entire plot. Well, not the entire plot. The other 1/4 involves how Brun likes his son, now he doesn't, now he does. Ad nauseum.  2) In addition to the repetitious plot, there is so much redundant text that one must wonder if ANYONE read the manuscript before it went to print. The author will write, for instance, about how the Clan was confused by Ayla's tears (since they don't cry), and then 10 pages later, she writes the same thing. I don't know how many times she wrote about Ayla's tears, Brun's worry about Broud, how intercourse is strictly a natural function, how they think she's ugly. Etc. Etc. (Etc. Etc.)  3. The "Be sure and purchase the next installment" ending in infuriating.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I see now why there are 5 copies of it in every used book store. That said, I read the whole thing in 5 days, so that must say something good about it 
 Let's start with the good things about this book.  It has extensive quotes from no less than 67 documents that are relevant to the conflict, along with five tables, two charts, and 23 maps.  And it does supply plenty of facts.  But this book completely misses the big picture, partially due to bias and partially due to poor scholarship.  Absurdly irrelevant events, such as Arafat saying (for the thirtieth time) that he might do something to promote peace, are given star treatment when they deserve no mention at all.  Major aspects of the conflict, such as the training of a generation of Arabs to be nihilistic antisemites, get little attention.  It is taken for granted that small details about borders are the main issues: the possibility that the fight is over something as fundamental as human rights is discounted.  The authors explicitly realize that the task of the historian is to determine truth, explain it, weed out lies, infer as yet unknown details, and predict the future.  They simply fail in that task.  Not only do they implicitly accept many manifest fabrications (only to take out their suspicions on those who ought not be mistrusted without good cause), they often fail to distinguish between errors of judgment and outright malice.  It is sad to see such problems with what could have been a far more useful reference. 
 Unfortunately, I had planned on using as the title of my review "I Am Bored," but George Hatch beat me to it. He couldn't have titled his review any more eloquently. I am very open-minded to films of varying backgrounds, styles, and national origins, and came by the Criterion release of the once controversial "I Am Curious" (Yellow and Blue) in an unusual promotion in which I received this box set free from a local bookstore when purchasing another box set. I am happy to report that I did not overpay for this set, but only by the slimmest of margins.   I had heard how controversial this film had been and was familiar with the court cases involved from reading extensively on cinema history, so I was looking forward to seeing what the commotion was about. The court cases boiled down to deciding if this was art or not, eventually allowing that it was. (I think the biggest argument in favor of that conclusion is that this is far too boring to be considered anything else.) While I had expected to discover an angst and obscenity-laden period piece about a young woman's journey during the social upheaval of the 1960s, what I actually found was four hours of unscripted, pretentious pomposity about the socialist movement in Sweden. The film is relentless in endorsing the socialist dogma so prevalent in Sweden in that era, but succeeds more in making the socialists look like a bunch of self-absorbed nits than anything else. The film frequently preaches an odd mix of revolution and non-violence (Martin Luther King, Jr. is even interviewed, though I doubt he would have wholeheartedly endorsed all the positions taken by the filmmakers) and dwells endlessly on whether or not Sweden in a "class society." The endorsed positions are actually right out of communist orthodoxy (the lead actress, Lena, is even seen studying a book by Mao Tse-tung at one point): extremely anti-religion, overtly stating that everyone should have equal incomes regardless of job responsibility, training, or personal aptitude, and explicitly condemning capitalism in numerous "anti-imperialist" protests which feature such chants and signs as "USA-Murderers," "Franco-Murderer," "Viva Ho Chi Minh," and "Indonesia is CIA's Gas Chamber: One Million People Murdered." (The film is especially anti-Franco, particularly in "Yellow.") In other words, right wing or capitalist societies are a scourge, but no socialist or communist society can do wrong.  Interestingly, while trying to make these points the prime socialists involved present themselves as so eminently unappealing as to make virtually any alternative look better in comparison. Never has this been more evident than in the very predominant scabies subplots (with attendant medical procedures including a bath of DDT, and a piece of music performed on banjo celebrating delousing) featured in both "Blue" and "Yellow." The intercutting of scenes depicting lack of self-restraint and personal responsibility with the social protests did not further the cause of socialism, certainly not from the vantage point of forty years of hindsight when most of the ideas espoused in the films look historically quaint and decidedly misguided.   The two films were released about a year apart and were cut from the same raw footage, though both are quite different in form. "Yellow" was the first released and features more unusual filmmaking techniques, and more interview footage. "Yellow" has a device, for instance, where you are supposed to guess the contents of Lena's bag, a game that was the inspiration for my title. "Blue" features slightly less social commentary, but a substantially uglier cast and gratuitous pole vaulting. "Blue" also features a mind-numbingly lengthy bike ride with Lena (and teddy bear) and some horrific folk songs, including one celebrating Torsten, a prison warden, introducing the subplot about prison welfare in Sweden.   Vilgot Sjoman directed this film and starred in "Yellow" opposite Lena. He is actually a gifted director, and by far the cleverest technique he uses in this film is the "movie within a movie" device, which sometimes obscures the action of what is actually occurring. For this attempt at making an artistically valid piece of cinema, I give him credit, and I find his commentary to be interesting as well. As with all Criterion releases the extras are superior, and from a technical viewpoint this is the definitive version of these two similar, yet divergent, films.   On balance I finally settled on giving the film(s) two stars: I really wanted to enjoy "I Am Curious," but each time I was about to settle into the plotline I was jolted back to reality by self-aggrandizement and a political dogma that was otherworldly in it's 1960s approach to income redistribution. Maybe the courts were right: maybe this is art. Just remember, though, that like anything else, there's bad art, too 
 I have gone through 3 of these straighteners (i know, you think I would have learned!) however, my first one was lost, my second one stopped working in a matter of months, and the third one stop working in less than a month!! I purchased the third one (despite what happened with the second one I had bought) because it was an affordable price, I liked the size, and when the second one I had did work it worked well. Unfortunately in a matter of a few weeks one of the plates burned out so only one side works (causing obvious problems). I would recommend the sedu it has gotten great reviews and is more expensive, but I think when it comes to straighteners you get what you pay for 
 We have a home inspection business and I read many books on real estate topics. This book was OK but certainly not worth recommending to our inspection clients. Some of the topics discussed are irrelevant to home inspections - such as mold! There were many topics lacking in the amount of information the author provided. Maybe if you don't know anything about houses or construction you might learn a little bit from this book. If you have a novice level of knowledge about house inspections then you should buy a different book since this book won't teach you anything new 
 You would be WAY better off just getting a book or pamplet from the National Park ranger station. There's very little information here, just stretched out over the length of a book. It's basically a Maine guide that they've repackaged as an Acadia guide. Here's a couple examples of the lame reporting that went into this book: They tell you how in some little local restaurants you might find the menu on a chalkboard and you should order from that. Oh, really???? Wow, never would have figured that out on my own. They try to throw a bone to the crowd that travels with dogs, but clearly they've never done so themselves. So they tell you that the local pet store carries a list of boarding facilities. So let's get this straight: I  spend all kinds of extra time and money getting my dog to a national park, only to board my dog??? The same pet store passes out a list of dog friendly restaurants, something people might actually want to know. But you won't find that out in this lame book 
 The book has beautiful photographs of models that have been expertly painted. However, there isn't a great deal of information on how to render these effects. I bought the book for my son to use in detailing model cars and model superheroes only to find that a large part of the book is devoted  to painting nude fairies! These are anatomically correct women with  butterfly wings on their back. Needless to say, we won't be using this  book. I am writing this review primarily to warn other parents considering  this book for their kids 
 It pains me to write it, but this book was bad. I thoroughly enjoy most of Douglas Adams' work especially the Hitchhiker's series. Unfortunately, he missed the mark with this book. I personally believe Adams wanted this book to be very funny, ala, the Hitchhiker books (others disagree), since it was: strike one. The storyline was quite complex, which would be fine, but I'm not 100% certain this is what Adams was trying to do: strike two. Finally, Dirk Gentry just is not equal to Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect (Hitchhiker's main characters) in terms of full, colorful characters, the final strike. Maybe it was my high expectations after reading the Hitchhiker series, which I found incredibly entertaining at 14, 24 and 34 years of age (for different reasons) 
 This collection of music by Harry Connick, whom I normally like very much, is NOT the music we heard in the motion picture. (...) I was very disappointed by this product and would not recommend this CD to anyone. Note that I'm not a Harry basher. I saw him live this summer at the Hollywood Bowl and he was fabulous. It's just a shame that this CD is borderline (...) presenting itself as the movie music (just look at the jacket). I cannot recommend this CD. 
  My old Wahl trimmer was not working right so I purchased this item based on all the positive reviews. What a disappointment! Hair gets caught very quickly in the comb and I have to keep removing the comb to empty the hair. It also periodically catches hair causing my partner to wince. Not good for a trimmer. Even using it corded it was not powerful enough and needed several passes to get a decent cut. We have been cutting each others hair for over 15 years (and saving lots of money in the process). This hair trimmer is one of the worst ones we have bought. I am going to look for another Wahl and will return this product if I can 
 Sometimes a writer's bias is so transparent that you don't even need to develop a rebuttal. You simply acknowledge his bias and respect his right to express his extreme, albeit twisted, view of the world.   Goozner is an economist, I majored in economics in both undergrad and grad school, the rest of my education is in chemistry, molecular biology, business and law. He writes about academic research, I have worked at National Laboratories and well known universities. He writes of the pharmaceutical industry, where I spent nearly a decade. And he writes about the biotechnology industry, where I spent another decade. Amazingly, all my life I have spent discovering and developing drugs. So I think I can say I read this book not as a layman, although at times it seemed to be written by one.   I usually enjoy books that are critical of things. They have a tendency to keep us honest and make us all too aware of our faults. But this book, while laudable for its story telling and historical walkabout, did not really get to a point where it stood on firm ground. So in the end, it was so overstated in its extremism, I could not take it seriously. Any good point that could have been made was underminded in its credibility by statements at times so braced by sheer nonsense, I felt bad for the author. I never did take this book seriously.  Goozer is one of those folks that does not believe the constitution is correct to provide protection to inventions through patents. Nor does he seem to believe in capitalism. Rather, he posits that pure open academic research is all that is needed to develop drugs. To him, the Bahy-Dole Act was a license for the pharmaceutical industry to steal from academia.  He would have us believe that all the great drugs developed today really come from academia. If you believe that, then you believe that the internet, as we now know it, including Amazon.com itself, came 100% from academia. Well no Mr. Goozner, Netscape founders and developers of Mosaic did indeed develop their "inventions" at the University of Illinois, but it took good old capatilism and $$ to turn all that into sophisticated products and tools. That is called fundamental research, basic research, being developed into marketibal products. The goal of academic research is not to develop marketable products, it is to further knowledge. The Bayh-Dole Act briged that basic research to the marketplace and last year alone, "academia" made $4 billion from license fees it recieved from those crooks that stole their technology and passed it off as their own after faking an $800 million investment.  The tens of thousands of industry scientists that spend decades developing drugs based on technology licensed from academia should be insulted by a book claiming they had no role in developing the product. I know I am, and I was in academia once.  Lots of things in his book are just plain wrong. To many to list. No need to, because his fundamental thesis is wrong to. I don't question his telling of all the history though, just his conclusions from it.  Lets take the $800 million. He tells us it costs only $100 million and not $800 million to develop a drug. Well, that is not quite what that number means. The $800 million is the cost for the one drug that made it to market, and the 50 that failed in research. That is called an absorbed cost. You see, the vast majority of drugs that are developed never see the pharmacist's shelf. I worked on one such drug that was abandoned after my company spent over $50 million developing it. Now if you are a stockholder, you think you might want a return on your investment. That one successful drug is it.   If we follow Mr. Goozner to the end of his diatribe, we would find that he literally expects the entire drug industry to be a non-profit industry. Well then, since Amazon.com was created from technology that came from academia, it should declare non-profit status and give away all its profits.  What could have been a strong calling to task on the pharmaceutical industry turned out to be nothing more than the fringe, almost socialist, views of an anticapitalist.  Finally, for an economist I was amazed that he managed to oversimplify how the pharmaecutical industry makes development decisions with all his "me too" drug conclusions. If I have to explain that one I am afraid I am going to have to hop on my pro Posner/Pareto/Coase pedistle and preach, which I don't want to do. That takes me back to my first statements. This author is bias against patents, capitalism, and a little uninformed about science (when he tried to be one, he made it obvious why he is not one). But I did like the walk through history, enough to ignore the misleading filters through which me wanted us to view that history. I gave him an extra star for that one. If you are a social engineer or igorant, you might like this book. If you are at all informed, it will leave you like a parody, amused and nothing more. 
 "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"   When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live 
 Sewn into the hem of an eighteenth-century cloak stored away in a museum, curators in the early twenty-first century discover twelve pages of handwritten notes, in code. When eventually deciphered these pages seem to indicate that shortly before his death, Benjamin Franklin paid an unemployed dock worker a sum of money to murder, thereby silence, the lowly-born woman who had given birth to Franklin's illegitimate son William. The notes are apparently the minutes kept at a sort of judicial hearing attended in secret by Washington, Hamilton, Adams, and Madison, in order that the question of Franklin's guilt or innocence, and what to do about the accusation, be decided. Are the pages a modern forgery, an eighteenth-century hoax, or did one of the most beloved Founding Fathers truly spill blood to preserve his reputation? I wish I knew. After finishing this novel, I still don't. Lehrer wastes his first eighty pages on flimsy character building, then it's true he finds his stride for about the next hundred, but the trouble is, I'll tell you now, the ending is one of those variety that makes your head hit the table, because it's so frustrating. Books that fail to answer questions are rudely-composed. Why write what you don't finish? 
 Besides reading this biography I suggest reading Paul E. Lovejoy's article, "Autobiography and Memory: Gustavus Vassa, alias Olaudah Equiano, the African."  A professor of history at York University in Canada, Lovejoy holds the Canada Research Chair in African Diaspora.  His paper can be found on line and in examining inconsistencies in the documentary record (only the baptismal record and one ship's muster list show South Carolina as a birthplace for Equiano) concludes convincingly that Vassa was not inventing his African childhood.

 I give this one star only because the site won't let me give it zero.  After agonizing through the first hundred pages of this book just to see if it got any better (it didn't) I was so disgusted with his tiresome prose and graphic accounts of slave beatings that I literally threw the book in the trash.  Slavery was wrong, Mr. Davis, we get it, now get on with what we are to learn that we supposedly never did. My conscience got the best of me regarding tossing the book, though, since I have a certain reverence for books (even bad ones) so I fished it out of the trash and put it on the exchange table at work in case some masochist feels compelled to delve into it in its entirety.  I bought it at Goodwill for $1.50; I see why it got sent to Goodwill.  It's not one to keep in a collection.  In fact, if we were still using Sears & Roebuck catalogs in outhouses.... 
 Pink Floyd is my favorite group of all time and a few hours ago I heard the Scissor Sisters do a cover of Comforably Numb on Saturday Night Live. It was the worst song I have ever heard. The Scissor Sistors are walking on ground they should'nt be walking on. The song was so bad that it took me a minute to figure out they were accually playing Comfortably Numb. I hope the Scissor Sisters are happy because they made a mockery of one of the greatest rock songs of all time 
 The book has great pictures and gives a good basic description of clothing. Granted there are some "classic" pieces in there, you're probably better off walking around a department store to see what is fashionable at the time. In addition to department stores, a subscription to GQ or any men's magazine would probably work also 
 The best word I could come up with to describe this book is...blah. There are so many loose pieces that are never tied together.  I would not recommend bothering with this book.  
 I would lie if I say that I saw Titus or heard the soundtrack (I take it it's true that some songs were copies ), but what I was frustrated is that I heard a totally ripped traditional macedonian song called "Zajdi,zajdi jasno sonce", here disguised as the 24th title - " Message for the queen ". Hmmm, I wonder how Tyler gets his "inspirations".. 
 I think this book may work for those who are really against letting their babies cry, but I have to say, if you are truly sleep deprived, trying to remember all of the things you're supposed to do at 2 am (and 3 am, 4 am, etc.) is nearly impossible. When I would wake up in the wee hours with my son, I couldn't remember all of the methods she described, and it wasn't like I could read the book right then! If you are really committed to this type of method, I would think it would work pretty well, but in my completely exhausted state, trying to remember several different steps to help my baby back to sleep made me more frustrated 
 It's beyond my comprehension how this book made #2 on the NYT list of the best novels of the last 25 years.  While it's well-written (in a structural, grammatical sense), it's devoid of any semblance of a plot or story line.  There were so many extraneous, disconnected sections that it made me wonder whether Mr. Delillo was somehow able to publish this book without the scrutiny of an editor.  My only satisfaction was in persevering to the end of this ponderous tome 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 What this psychic can teach you about life is this: growing up is hard. Yes, he's had some unusual experiences, but they don't make up for the wisdom that comes with maturity. The author exerts a tremendous amount of energy begging for the reader's sympathy. Admittedly, the average reader can glean helpful information from the last chapter or so, but I truly think the information would have made a much better article in Oprah and would have reached a wider readership. There just isn't enough substance here to warrant it being a book. If you're looking for a biography of a self-serving young person, this is it. If you're looking for something that relates to the title, read the last chapter and move on.
