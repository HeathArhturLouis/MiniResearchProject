 He finally did it. (Note: this review has nothing to do with Elliott Smith.)  Every fan of Braid or Hey Mercedes has once wondered in their heart of hearts if Bob Nanna and co. would finally issue a straight-up, honest pop record. We're talking Material Issue, Dada, or the Raspberries. Loses Control recalls all of their reference points: earnest `70s power pop, affected `80s Smiths influenced alt-rock and `90s Midwestern basement angst.  How they've incorporated the last one without resorting to cheesy Taking Back Sundayisms beats the hell out of me. Even the Get Up Kids can't get it up anymore. In a word, Loses Control combines quality, hooks and power. Hey Mercedes always seemed to have two out of three. Until now.  "It's Been A Blast" recalls much of the late Braid's power (and the late Braid's late period, natch, as that's when they regrouped as Hey Mercedes.) Early Braid always relied on cute Kinsellaesque puns, skronky dueling guitars and single-tracked vocals, whereas the work of 1998's Frame & Canvas and their last few singles ("First Day Back," "Please Drive Faster") relied more on chunky chord progressions.  The fluid majesty of the late Braid days stands out on tracks like "Go On Drone," an ode to the girls and streets of the Midwest. Loses Control is simply an album about beer and girls, but one of the best ones in recent memory. "Oh Penny," makes listeners remember why Nanna's ear for an odd melody is one of his strongest assets.  The first track, "Quality Revenge At Last" is the obvious single. In the video, car wash squeegees mimic Nanna's Xerox-copier guitar, and it works. Hold Sean Slade responsible for the assured, dense production. Sure, it's no Live Through This or Pablo Honey, but Loses Control possesses much of the sunny self-assuredness of Slade's work with Juliana Hatfield, Echobelly or Papas Fritas.  Even the more mediocre album tracks like "Knowing When To Stop" and "The Boy Destroyers" would sound like highlights when juxtaposed with their last album, 2001's Every Night Fireworks. We got a winner on our hands - just don't tell the teen demographic that a bunch of 28-year-olds wrote their emo-pop album of the year.  Confidential to Nanna: all bonus points awarded for unironic quotation of Sam Cooke's "You Send Me" on "Lashing Out" are hereby revoked for all references to the Knack, either musical or lyrical. To paraphrase David Crosby, referring to John Lennon's assassin: "We must never say [their] name." 
 Marvelous story with historical concepts and involment leading the reader to intrigue and fascination.  Buy this book. 
 I really wonder how much acceptence and detatchment can responsibly be accepted by a thinking humanitarian in this day and age. There is a luxury and an innocence in such thinking that many of us can no longer afford.I'm desperate for more real meat and less ideology.  Though not as well written and perhaps too robust for many readers--a more forward looking vision can be found in FitzGeralds manual for life "Sea-Steading" 
 This is a great case, the arm band works great, the clip works ok, the screen protecter you stick on is simply stunning, and the buttons really are easier to press. But it makes the scroll wheel a little harder to spin No big deal. the only problems i got with this case is when i got it in the mail it had a tiny tear near the headphone hole. the shipping price also sucks 
 This is one of the best explanations of the Christian's responsibility to evangelize I have heard. This book isn't simply about predestination vs. free will, it is a perspective on the whole question of Christian evangelism in light of God's sovereignty. Packer shows that, when properly viewed, the sovereignty of God does not remove our responsibility to evangelize. He writes a very good perspective on the relationship between God's sovereignty and man's responsibility, showing that both the "freewill" position and the "hyper-Calvinist" (i.e. those who say that God's sovereignty precludes our responsibility to evangelize) position are wrong and unBiblical. He also makes some interesting comments on the WAY that we evangelize. For example, he points out that many consider evangelistic sermons to be a "special" type of sermon and evangelistic meetings to be a "special" type of meeting, but ALL of Scripture, both Old and New  Testaments, point to Jesus, so any sermon that properly teaches the Bible is in a sense evangelistic, and every properly run church service should point to Jesus. He points out that this attitude of "special" sermons and "special" meetings is very indicting of the modern church - i.e. that many "sermons" and "church services" are NOT really properly teaching the Bible and are NOT properly pointing to Jesus. This is particularly true of many topical sermons and "Christianity-lite" (I once heard of a Christmas "sermon" on "how to avoid anxiety at Christmastime" - no mention of Jesus' birth, life, teachings, or work for us). This does not mean, of course, that we should not have special meetings or sermons for the sole purpose evangelism, or that we should not make a special effort to evangelize. Packer argues that these should still occur, particularly considering the paganism dominating our culture of late.  Anyone who wants to better understand the Christian's responsibility to evangelize, or the relationship between God's sovereignty and man's evangelism (and who doesn't want to understand these better?), should read this book. It is excellent 
 I used to love kiss, until i stopped listening to them for a little while. Once i started i didn't like them as much. Oh well, This compilation is great! best one they released. Why? Because it has 40 songs! repeat! 40 songs! That is one big money saver! it has hits such as deuce, strutter, love gun, black diamond, parasite, etc. I personaly would have liked deuce more if it was played live. The last half of the second cd, is really unnecessary. And 5 songs from Destroyer?! come on! Kiss writes too many mainstream songs. And i don't see how gene simmons always gets the girl! They're have an  "i'm a rock and roller but all i talk about is girls!" kinda attitude. in the mid 80's, bands like Motley crue started taking over. That scene was called Glam Metal. But Kiss was one of the only bands who started that kinda music back in the 70's!!   So goodbye, you may not like this review but just informing you that Kiss writes about the same thing over and over again. Example:I want you, Calling Dr. Love, Anything for my baby, Deuce etc. I used to like Ozzy and Iron Maiden but somehow Kiss put a spell on me and said "buy me". Somehow i couldn't resist and i bought it. Big mistake. Now i hate kiss. I now like Metallica and Judas Priest. Oh well, you can listen to whatever you wan 
 For the past year, I have been following Danny Schechter's column on Mediachannel.org. His insights are special, often humorous, and his writing is unequalled in both its lightness and its depth. I was very glad, therefore, to hear of the publication of this book, and I was not disappointed: It containts various articles from the News Dissector's long and unusual career in the media, in the same style and intelligence of his contemporary columns. They illuminate a unique media personality, and I heartily recommend the book 
 My 3 1/2 year old grandson rented this movie from the library.  I can't tell you how many times this was watched in a week!  My husband loved it so much we had to buy one.  It is a great movie for kids and adults alike 
 Catherine Merridale's "Ivan's War" is a brilliant book - meticulously well researched, incredibly well written, and tremendously insightful and informative.  Merridale makes it clear in the opening pages of her book that one aim of "Ivan's War" is to dispel the myths surrounding the Red Army soldier embedded by defeated German officers in western military culture after the war. Forced to write reports on the nature of the Soviet Army and its soldiers for the Allies, captured Nazi officers dehumanized their Eastern Front opponent, labeling the Russian soldier semi-Asiatic, primitive, unassuming, morosely passive, dishonest and deceptive. This racist labelling endured for many years and was reflected in Allied works on the Soviet soldier.  "Ivan's War" examines every aspect of Ivan's military life and is full of details gleaned from the Soviet archives.  Merridal notes, for example, that at the time of the German invasion of Russia, the Red Army had some 23,000 tanks, but that three-quarters of these were inoperable for maintenance reasons. Later, she shows that in the opening months of the war on the Eastern Front the Russians lost twenty soldiers for each German killed.  With some 70 million Soviet citizens behind German lines at the peak of the Wehrmacht's advance, Stalin resorted to terror and coercion to stop the retreat of the Red Army. In all, some 422,700 Soviet soldiers served in punishment battalions during the war. Merridal describes these formations as "forlorn, deadly, soul destroying." And 158,000 Red Army soldiers were executed during the war, 13,500 alone at the Battle of Stalingrad.   Still, incentives were also used to motivate the Red Army soldier. For example, eleven milllion decorations were awarded to members of the Soviet military during the war, and while the U.S. Army frequently took six months to process awards, Stalin's army frequently accomplished the same in three days.  Merridale shows that the German soldier respected his Russian opponent. "I cannot understand how men survive such hell," writes one Luftwaffe pilot at Stalingrad. "Yet the Russians sit tight in ruins, and holes and cellars, and a chaos of steel skeletons which used to be factories." And a German soldier concludes: "The Russians are not men, but some kind of cast-iron creatures."  Certainly the German extermination of millions of Soviet soldiers and civilians filled Ivan with hate and motivated him to fight in a way neiter coercion nor rewards could. Merridale records that the Germans killed some 7.5 Soviet civilians during their occupation of the Soviet Union. "Russia's long torment, then, was real," writes Merridale, "and like most cases of persecution, it created in the sufferers a sense of outrage, of entitlement, of solidarity."  If these is one weakness with Merridale's seminal work it is her over reliance on interviews with Jewish Red Army soldiers.  In an armed forces that saw some 30 million men and women serve, Jews made up a very small minority. Merridale admits that Jews are disproportionately represented among the veterans with whom she talked. The problem is that, in light of the tremendously anti-Semitic strain that ran through Soviet society and the Red Army, even during the war but especially after it, one would expect the comments of Jewish veterans to be overly negative and pessimistic. And they are.   The author thus paints a darker picture of life in the Red Army than was probably the case. Other writers, most notably Vasily Grossman in the recently published "A Writer at War" (another masterfulwork) show the good and the bad and note there was a great deal of both.  Still, "Ivan at War" is a moving and masterful tribute to the Russian soldier of World War II. It is time the west moved beyond racist labelling and recognized "Ivan" as the living, feeling and victorious soldier being that he was 
 Although I've heard the Hanukkah story many, many times, I enjoyed reading this book with my children to experience the many ways this holiday and history is celebrated throughout the world.  The author relates the shared story in a beautiful, poignant and delightful way 
 Jonnes gives us a look at the story of electrification from Edison's discovery of the incandescent light to completion of the Niagara Falls hydroelectric generating station (using Westinghouse equipment based on Tesla's AC patents).  She begins with an overview of what was known about electricity-the relationship between electricity and magnetism, discovered by Michael Faraday, and the development of electromagnets by Joseph Henry.  Development of practical generators in the 1870s, was soon followed by the first arc lights, but they were cumbersome and too bright for home use.  Edison took up the challenge to develop an electric light suitable for home use in 1878, completed in 1879, and installed in New York City in 1882.  Edison firmly believed in his DC power system, but it was poorly suited to transmitting power long distances.  Once AC transformers were invented, in 1885, George Westinghouse realized that AC was the more practical system.  He licensed Tesla's patents for AC generator and motor and began installing systems.  A major battle ensued with Edison promoting DC and charging that AC was unsafe.  That resulted in the adoption of the AC powered electric chair as a means of execution.  Edison General Electric and Westinghouse found themselves in direct competition many times.  Edison was a darling of the media.  His side of the story has been told many times.  Westinghouse was personable, but far less open to the press.  No biographies have appeared since 1926.  Tesla was a frequent publisher, gave numerous demonstrations especially at technical meetings.  His eccentric nature leads to some treatments as a man of mystery.  The detailed treatment of the Niagara Power project is much appreciated.  This was the first major hydroelectric project in the US.  It was financed by a Wall Street syndicate headed by JP Morgan.  We see the details of how the bankers brought in experts to get the best available advice on the project.  Finally Westinghouse won the competition because he had licensed the Tesla AC patents.  There was no nearby customer for the power from Niagara.  Buffalo, 26 miles away was the logical one.  But the project also spawned numerous industries that took advantage of low cost electric power.  This is the founding of well known companies.  Among them Alcoa (first production of low cost aluminum), Carborundum (abrasives made by electric furnace), Union Carbide (acetylene made by electric furnace), and Hooker Chemical (chlorine, bleach, alkalis, sodium hydroxide, sodium all made by electrolysis of salt water).  Niagara began supplying power to Alcoa on Aug 26, 1895.  The book also gives us a profile of three inventors: Edison, Westinghouse, and Tesla.  We are shown how financiers dealt with them.  In Feb, 1892, JP Morgan and associates merged Edison General Electric with another holding, Thompson Houston, renamed the combine General Electric Co., and put CEO Charles Coffin in charge without even consulting Edison.  George Westinghouse lost control of his company after it sank into bankruptcy in the Panic of 1907.  He was soon forced out of the company.  A proxy fight to regain control in 1911 failed.  Tesla licensed his key AC patents to Westinghouse and initially received generous royalties.  But he agreed to give up those royalties as part of a Westinghouse rescue plan in the Panic of 1891.  His other patents were tied up in a deal with JP Morgan to fund radio development.  After Marconi beat him to market, he was unable even to defend his own patents.  He died penniless.  This is a great read for those interested in technology and how it all came together.  We are left hungering for a second volume to cover the rest of the electrification story.  We hear nothing of Samuel Insull, very little of the development of electric street cars, electric railroads, interurbans, the electric automobile, TVA, rural electrification, or the expansion of electrical systems throughout the country.  Excellent bibliography.  Many references.  Index. 
 This past June I visited Brice Taylor who escaped from theCIA's MKULTRA Mind Control Program for 4 days at her home in SouthCarolina, and this well documented book backs up EVERYTHING she saysin her book "Thanks for the Memories- the Truth Has Set MeFree" Since the mid 70's the USA and Russia have been engaged ina microwave war that has seriously increased the cancer rate, and hascaused severe depression in a lot of people who have no idea thattheir brainwaves are being entrained by a 6.6 herz signal being beamedto us 24/7, while we do the same back to them. But it gets worse: thisbook documents that via such microwave technology as HAARP, they arerapidly developing mass mind control ability, and unless exposed andstopped, they'll soon force every one of us into a psychocivilizedsociety in which ALL free will will have been stripped from us, andTHIS is their goal. Learn the history of this insane technology.  Readabout monsters such as Dr.s Cameron and Delgado, and hear theirtotalitarian statements. Delgado demonstrated a prototype by putting abrain implant in a bull, which charged him til he hit a button on hishand held control behind his red cape, and the charging bull came to ascreeching halt, and turned docily around and went back where it camefrom.  Now they can do this with people, and from very longdistances. They actually have the ability to use microwaves andimplants to put thoughts and even voices into your mind, and to makeyou do anything they want. This technology was originally conceivedinside the Nazi concentration camps, and was brought to the USA viaProject Paperclip at the end of WW2 when a slew of Nazi scientistswere brought to the USA, and we're currently facing the prospect of a4th Reich, imminently more frightening than anything Hitler could evenCONCEIVE of. We can STOP this sick agenda, but ONLY if enough peopleWAKE UP and start asking a lot of questions, veryquickly!.. 
 Gosh, I hate the word DUMMIES. The information in this book is basic but is written in a bit of a condescending manner. The delivery is often simplistic, if not silly. (For example, they say my ovaries were dozing and asleep. That's why my period was late some months. Silly.) The Dummies book reminds me of how a mother might explain something to a little kid. (Gee, I hate that word Dummies.) I am sure it is a coincidence that two similar books came out the same month, but of the two, I much prefer The Menopause Survival Guide by Donna Rogers, which I purchased. In that book, the information is delivered like two adult women were sitting around talking about menopause, and one is explaining to the other what is actually going on in their bodies 
 Best live reggae album ever!  Even if you find reggae boring, if you'ra a rock fan you will love this.  Bushmaster alone is worth the purchase of this album 
 This is the first book that I've read which establishes the relationship between emotions, power, and conflict. The book is easy to read and understand, and there are many thought-provoking examples and a self-inventory at the end of each chapter, and I found these to be quite helpful.  If a person wants to understand conflict, he/she must first understand his/her sense of power and the emotions that we feel motivated by.  This book explains these things very well, and I highly recommend it to everyone 
 You learn extremely fast using Rosetta stone, and you learn to think about what the word is, not it's translation. Probably the best language system available 
 I noticed this book 4 years ago after our first child (a girl) was born. Last year we bought it with the intention of trying for a boy. The suggestions did work, but what really helped us was buying a ovulation kit and abstaining for a few days prior.  You really need to get a handle on the ovulation times. Also, be happy with whatever the Good Lord gives you!  Don't buy this book if you are obsessed with a particular gender. Buy it to try and have fun with. It just might work for you as it did us! 
 What a brave thing to do, to release the complete soundtrack of a 40 year old movie, written by a composer not universally known. Full marks to the brave genius who thought of doing it. And a huge thank you from all movie music fans around the world. Please release more like this.  This music is far better than most scores composed today. It is full of glorious sounds and textures, and the overture and main titles are enough to buy it. The general atmosphere evoked by this music alternates between mysterious, exotic, romantic, dramatic and heroic.  A truly great score, written by a master who never really became as well-known as he should have.  By the way ... please release Alex North's score of 'Agony and the Ecstasy' in full as well. I'm on my knees begging you 
 I had a chance to listen to these little speakers at a friend's house and I liked them very much. They had distinctive high ends that could only be found from JBL speakers. The midrange was pretty smooth and clear but obviously there was not much bass from the small 4" drivers. Because of their flexible on-wall mounting/positioning and since each of them also has a 3/4" Titanium-laminate tweeter as the E-series speakers, I planned to buy a pair of them to use as surround back speakers in my 7.1 speaker system which consists of all E-series speakers. However, when I contacted JBL's technical supports, I was told that the N24AWII's were very close timbre-match but not perfect match for the E-series speakers and that I would better use the E10's instead if I wanted perfect tonal match for my speaker system. I think I will get the E10's but the E10's can't be mounted on the wall as easily and as flexibly as the N24AWII 
 I thumbed through and read this book in about an hour last night, and saw some annoying typos, so it seems the proofing stage might have been skipped... but regardless, I was inspired by what I saw in there, for sure, and can only hope and pray that I'm good enough to be in that book someday.  (And by the way, if I ever get in, you are FREE to spell my name however you please.)  ;)  I'd recommend this book 
 Clifford 'Kip' Russell has a dream, he wants to go to the Moon and while his father thinks its a great idea but its up to Kip to find a way to get there.  Fortunately for Kip a soap company is running a contest with a grand prize of....a trip to the moon.  Kip manages to win, but not the grand prize, instead he got a space suit.  While trying out his new prize Kip is swept up - literally - and finds himself on the way to the moon.  What he had never imagined was that he would be taking the trip in the company of aliens, human thugs, and a 12 year old girl named Peewee.  Even more amazing he finds himself preventing an alien invasion and defending the entire human race in an alien court.  This 1958 book is one of the 'juveniles' that Heinlein wrote in the '40's and '50's.  While the plot is obviously fantastic and very much aimed at the youth audience, it is an enjoyable read for any age reader.  Kip and Peewee have to face the challenges of defining just what defines a 'person' and what responsibiities a person has to themself and to his fellow beings.  Are there flaws in this work?  Absolutely, many of the characters are there just to say or do their piece and then move on, we do not ever learn just what their motivations are.  The young heroes are just a bit too perfect and the coincidences are often just too convenient.  At times Heinlein's handling of the dialog is not as skilled as it will be in later works, and, as often is in Heinlein's work a little more editing would not be misplaced.  Often in Heinlein's early works there are very stereotypical attitudes concerning women, they are relegated to subservient roles, i.e. Kip loves his mother but we learn very little about her, also Peewee's mother is portrayed as more of nuisance than anything else.  In this novel though Heinlein is beginning to change this, Peewee is shown to be Kip's equal and the alien guardian is definitely female.  This book is fun, light reading that, like the rest of Heinlein's work, slips some serious ideas in when the reader least expects it.  There is also the fun of seeing just what developments Heinlein predicts correctly and which he misses.  In this one the hero still computes on a sliderule, an item that most highschool students of today have never seen, much less used 
 Franklin's timeless compilation of whit and wisdom is truly a classic.  The book contains some of the most interesting and impressive collection of comments that Franklin was able to put in this compendium.  While many are ascribed to Franklin, he specifically does not take credit for the adages himself.  Rather, he indicates that they are commonly utilized comments and expressions of the vernacular.  The individual enticements cover all areas of thought and society.  He was able to capture these moments of brilliance and publish them so that they are available for all time.  Such common phrases and expressions are recognizable to most readers.  When Franklin says, "You can bear your own Faults, and why not a Fault in your Wife?" the reader sees these as aphorisms that are applicable as well in 2006 as they were when he published them back in the 18th Century.  While Franklin may not have penned all these witticisms personally, he surely did massage them through his brilliant mind.  Such comments as "Time is an herb that cures all diseases" and "Better slip with Foot than Tongue" are metaphors that all could have come up with, but Franklin was the one who wrote them down for all time.  In fact, the reader can open virtually any page in the book and find something that is applicable to whatever situation is at hand.  The book is an essential part of all reader's libraries.  It is recommended for every and all serious readers. 
 I found the book to be very helpful. It gives me a platform from which I can be more personable and relate info in a more interesting way 
 Nora Roberts never disappoints her readers. Her books are filled with humor, romance, intrigue and, in this case, a little bit of the supernatural. Loved this book, and the subsequent books in the series. I'd recommend all three. Roberts presents a story with strong women as the main characters and lets us follow them through their own insecurities and their own personal challenges. It's a great journey for the readers to experience 
 One reviewer said this book was only for people who enjoy religion, but I disagree.  I am very skeptical about organized religion, and I absolutely love and applaud this book.  This story is one of acceptance and teaches that many opinions of God can be correct.  The illustrations are beautiful and so is the story that Wood tells.  I think it's an important message for kids to hear and for parents to remember 
 I am a former pastor who has been out of "full time" pastoring for about 3 years - now I'm a internet consultant.  It's been interesting to look at church leadership from the pew again, and to see the weaknesses of our churches and of the leadership in them.  This book has put into words what my heart has been from the since God first called me: truly equipping people to achieve their purpose as believers in Christ.  It is radical.  It is unsettling.  But it's words are true, even in the business world, these principles can apply.  And when the opportunity opens that I get back into ministry full time, I will begin to apply these principles of leadership 
 This is a must have for any student of the Bible. Hannah brilliantly summarizes church history and organizes his book around key doctrines.  It is interesting, fresh, conservative and extremely helpful for spiritual growth. When one realizes most of the issues that Christians wrestle with today have already been dealt with, one wants to learn from history, so as not to repeat it again.  Thanks Dr. Hannah 
 Northern Ireland: Can Sean And John Live In Peace? An American Legal Perspective by Carol Daugherty Rasnic (Professor of Employment and Labor Law, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia) is an impressively researched and presented study of the conflict in Northern Ireland, including the religious and political forces that drive it, as well as the law and the legal system as a means to deal with what the Irish called "the troubles". A thoughtful, exhaustive, scholarly inquiry, Northern Ireland is a sober and informative account and a very welcome contribution to academic International Studies modern reference collections concerned with global issues and conflicts in general, and Contemporary Irish Political History reading lists in particular 
 I am in the same field as Scott, and have recommended his book countless times to consumers. With credit card companies raising rates, fees, etc. his advice could not be more timely.   I just interviewed Scott today (8/11/05) on my EverydayWealth Radio program on [...] and he told me how he just got a 10 month old late fee waived! That's practically unheard of.   I can't recommend Scott's book highly enough. You'll easily recoup many times the price of the book if you implement his suggestions. 
 This book is a historical interpretation of the effect of technology on society.  Mumford traces the Industrial Revolution to its earliest roots, which he argues, go back to the invention of reliable timepieces in the Eleventh Century (whose invention was motivated, according to Mumford, by the need for recognizing prayer times in Catholic monasteries). Mumford also stresses the effects mining, the military, and the production of arms had on each other and on the development of technology, from earliest recorded history through modern times.  Another recurrent theme is power, and how discoveries of new ways to harness power led to economic development. The final part of the book discusses the invention and assimilation of "the machine," as a generic concept for an advanced technology item. The book is illustrated with several sections of black-and-white photographs and reproductions of artwork.  End material includes a chronology of inventions, a lengthy annotated bibliography, and an index.  In a discussion of the motivation behind invention, Mumford notes that "a good part of the mechanical elements in the day are attempts to counteract the effects of lengthening time and space distance.  The refrigeration of eggs, for example, is an effort to space their distribution more uniformly than the hen herself is capable of doing...The accompanying pieces of mechanical apparatus do nothing to improve the product itself: refrigeration merely halts the process of decomposition."  Is this progress?  Although he originally wrote this book back in the 1930s, well before our present energy crises, Mumford was adamant that renewable energy sources must supply the power of the future.  He is an advocate for wind and water energy, and he dreams of a day when the power of the sun can be used to generate electricity.  Mumford is also disturbed by rampant consumerism. He quotes a Hoover Committee report on a survey of Recent Economics that states "The survey has proved conclusively, what has long been held theoretically to be true, that wants are almost insatiable; that one want makes way for another.  The conclusion is that economically we have a boundless field before us; that there are new wants which will make way endlessly for newer wants, as fast as they are satisfied."  Interesting points such as these, which sound remarkably fresh today, can be found scattered amongst the text.  Unfortunately, however, such gems are overshadowed by the sheer volume of text. This book would benefit greatly from an abridgment that would bring out the best, most important ideas by eliminating the wordy asides and statements of personal opinion 
 I used this book as a tool for a graduate-level course. It is outstanding in its ability to present a sometimes difficult topic in an easy-to-understand format. The book includes practical tips, ideas, and examples. Highly recommended! 
   The Woodlanders is the eleventh novel by Thomas Hardy. Hardy takes us to an obscure village in his mythical Wessex. The novel portrays the beautiful Grace Melbury a nubile young miss coddled by her parents; eager for glamour and disdainful of bucolic boredom. Grace is courted by Giles Winterbourne a local rustic but cast him off to wed Dr. Edred Fitzpiers the local doctor. The marriage is a disaster for Fitzper lusts for Madame Charmond. He also has a fling with Suke a local girl. Fitzpiers flees to the Continent while Grace seeks reconciliation with  Winterborne. The couple hope to wed under a newly passed Parliamentary  law dealing with the right of women to obtain a divorce.   All goes wrong. Accidents occur as chance and fortune always play a part in the Hardy world. The novel does end happily which is rare for Hardy.   Hardy knew the English countryside as it moved from spring to winter. His description of nature is beautifully written. Hardy also knew the south of England as it was moving from the rural nineteenth century to the modern world of the coming twentieth century.   The Woodlanders is one of the lesser known Hardy novels that is well worth your attention. The story is well told with many interesting and exciting plot developments which will hold the attention. Well recommended. 
 This is a really great introduction to what the symbols, colors, and items mean in iconography. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in iconography. 
      Cibelle is still at her best even without the late, great SUBA. I think SUBA knew she can hold her own too !  She's Six Degrees Music's Diamond in a cluster of gems  
 This is a fine book on the process of the canonization.  He goes into specific detail on the New Testament, while also mentioning the catalysts behind the move toward acceptance.  Bruce is extremely knowledgeable on this topic, including literary, historical, and liturgical evidence for the whole of Scripture being canonized.  
 This book is my first AJAX book and frankly speaking this book did keep up its promises with a good introduction and smooth-sailing examples. I am not a Client-side scripting expert, but I found this book feeds a lot basics about Javascript and even CSS. These scripting langaugaes are important when you are working with Ajax. The book has lots of examples that you'll find useful to fully understand what is going on. I found I could modify several of the examples and drop them into my own Ajax project. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get introduced to Ajax programming and could also use a primer on Javascript and CSS. I may probably buy another one other book on Ajax simply because it is still evolving and not standardized. Thus I feel sure there's more tricks to learn till AJAX hits all parts of the Internet. Worth reading + worth a buy and you will NOT be disappointed 
 Ages 12 and up.The title "A Step From Heaven" first does not say a lot to you, until you start reading the book. The main charcater Young Ju is a 4 year old korean girl who is about to move to america. With innocent and creative mind Young Ju has, she does not understand the meaning of America. The reader will see Young Ju  growing up,getting in understanding of more things,and slowly learning a new language. You will read everything through her mind, how she compares one thing to another and how she thinks.  The book is not unrealistic because Young Ju is able too adapt to the American culture, but she is not perfect nor her family life is perfect.  The book is not the easiest book to read after all you have to understand a 4 year old's to a 20 year old's thought process. Every chapter in the book is a little event in her life and the book goes through 4-21 very fast.This book of An Na is a challenging and beautiful book to read 
 I'd say that we live in a time of conspiracy theories, except that they have been around seemingly forever. Certainly there were a bunch of them surrounding Lincoln's death, and Kennedy and Roswell. In this book, Peter Lance an award winning investigative reporter looks carefully into the TWA 800 case and the 9/11 incident.    He brings up a lot of interesting points. But I'm not sure just what to believe. For instance, he asks the question 'Why wasn't NORAD (the Air Force) alerted to the hijackings until eighteen minutes after air traffic controllers realized a hijacking was in progress.' I think that's pretty easy to answer. The controllers weren't sure it was a hijacking, they are government employees, they had to get permission first. And the boss was probably in the bathroom, in a meeting, on the phone. There are all kinds of reasons to use up 18 minutes. You don't want to charge conspiracy when simple incompetance may account for it.    You may accept, or reject his conclusions, (or like me, admit you don't know) but if you don't have the information, you can't even make that decision. Mr. Lynch has exhaustively researched the files, studies and news reports. The resulting book is an excellent summary of what happened. I was particularly impressed with the TWA 800 information as this has been less available than 9/11 information 
 Chesterton expressed his passion for history and sacrificial heroism in this ballad.  If you enjoy the imagery and values of Arthur, CS Lewis and the Iliad, you will enjoy this short book.  "Heart of the heroes, ride! 
 Well I followed advise from the other reviewers and covered the meat with plastic wraps so that there's no mess at all and result is great.  I'd like it better if they rotate the handle by 90 degrees so that the flat side rest in my hand 
 My 3 year old requests to listen to this CD over and over again!  It is fantastic since I know the words to all the songs too.  I love singing and dancing around the house with my son to this CD.  It is much better than laying around the house and watching another movie.  What was even better was listening to this CD on our last road trip.  I never heard a peep out of him except his singing!  It is a MUST HAVE! 
 Each time people around me lost their family, I gave this book.  Most of them said that it was a great help to recover from grief.  I, myself experienced a hard time to accept mentally a familly member's death and the book gave me a relief, though I do not believe everything written in it 
 This is a good book that is well worth it's cost. It lives up to it's title, and I benifited from reading it 
 This pop filter does exactly what it purports to; the flexible neck *does* sacrifice a bit of flexibility in favor of stability, which can be a slight drawback if (like me) you use it on a tabletop mic stand. Still, quite recommended 
 This book is hysterical.  All kids, and adults, will love it 
 1. This book is about a girl who wants to go to war. she became a scool teacher. Then she dressed up liek a guy and goes home to see if her mother reconizes her. then she goes to sign up for the army and makes it in. 2. This dook made me think a lot differnt about girls in the pastbecause girkls trey to do the same tings that men did.  3. there is a lot of irony in the story becaise they did not expect a girl to go to war for her counter. 4. I recomand this book to people who mlokes Historicalk Fiction 
 The previous reviewer accurately describes the technical viscissitudes of this re-release. In fact, and as I recall the film from the '60s, this DVD is so dark that at times it feels like a completely different work, almost noirish in places. The impression is quite different.  But what a good tale! What moves it right along is that all of the characters are caricatures. In the '60s, the war still horrifyingly fresh in memory, we all knew what our characters were supposed to be like in war flics, so that this show seemed a welcome relief, permitting us some reserved laughter. So, the German commander and the French underground agent offered us a pleasant outlet over a most unpleasant event in recent history.  Ultimately, though, it's the wondrous Catherine Deneuve at lens center who makes the film work, as we see her genius emerging so early in her life. Not to seem gushing, now, but isn't it great that the DVD medium enables us all these many re-releases, permitting us to see anew the tremendous artistic range of her four decades in cinema! All the way from "Umbrellas of Cherbourg" to "Indochine", we receive the bigger picture of what a great actress she is, and how fortunate we are.  So buy this DVD, already. You'll like it 
 I picked this up at my local BRUs store.  I've had the snack cup only going on 6 yrs now on an umbrella stroller and got this set for my 3rd child's new Combi Savvy EX stroller.  The stroller came with a soft pack accessory holder that angled with the handles of the stroller but I needed more drink holders for my 2 older children and us adults.  It has WORKED PERFECTLY for us and I didn't have any problems installing the clamps - more details on that later.   The very dark navy set (as pictured) blends well with my black & silver stroller.  This is what the set comes with and what it's for: 1) 2 clips/clamps with large & small crews (used large screws to fit around the oval tubing of my stroller) and an allen wrench.  I think more clips would've been nice so people could use more of the attachments so I'm going to try to find long screws to replace the small screws I used on the clip on my old umbrella stroller.  2) 3 different sized "C" shaped bottle holders (pop bottle in at the neck) Use small size for normal water bottles, medium for Gerber styled baby bottles & wide-mouthed water bottles (i.e. Propel & Gatorade) and large for Avent style baby bottles.   3) A big cup holder - it was already assembled so we haven't had problems with the arms popping out, as other reviewers have stated.  It can be attached to the clips on 2 sides, one where the cup can swivel (why??? I don't know) or the other where it's stationary. 4) Double-cupped snack cup with connected lids that swivel open. 5) A mesh bag that is small (7 x 9.5 inches) but people - I think this bag is to hold all the attachment parts! 6) 2 large "S" hooks and 2 small "S" hooks.  They do look flimsy but they work.  Keep in mind, you aren't supposed to load up your stroller with heavy items anyway (so it won't tip over) so don't expect to hang your loaded cooler on it!  We used both large hooks, one with a bag that held my Bjorn baby carrier and the other with a bag of snacks & small pint sized water bottles in it.  I do have the multi-colored "S" hooks from another manufacturer - they are very sturdy and do swivel but they will not fit on the tubes of this stroller.    NOTE: I have not seen large enough hooks for the aluminum oval tubes of these newer strollers. So these will be very useful b/c the basket underneath our stroller does hold a good amount but not enough for a productive day at the mall :-)  Other reviewers have rated this item low for what I think are unwarranted reasons or high expectations of an after-market stroller accessory.  This item will not work on EVERY stroller out there.  Yes, the big cup holder will stick out a bit but at the zoo or mall we haven't had anything fall out.  Put some forethought into placement of the clamps and you won't be frustrated putting them on.   RE: Installation:  I recommend closing your stroller first and look it over for possible locations of the clamps.  Then when first installing the clamps, test the closing of your stroller before totally tightening the screws.  On our Combi, it goes right above the clamps that you pull that closes the stroller and right under the included accessory pack.  Later when our baby starts eating snacks I can see a possible place for it right next to the seat frame but then the front rail of the stroller does have 2 cup holders on it so I think we'll really end up keeping the 2 clips up top for us.  The location it's at now is angled and yes, your attachments will end up holding your drinks straight.  The attachment pieces have an octagonal shape so when you pop the piece in, it can be straight.  Taking the piece off is easy, you only need to hold the clamp with one hand and pull the piece off with another.  DON'T FORGET to take these attachments off before closing the stroller and throwing it in the trunk of your car b/c the items may pop-off and get lost or they may break.  This set has REALLY WORKED WELL for us and the price is good.  We were set with drinks for the whole family for a full day at theme parks and the zoo! Good luck 
 This book is especially for intelligent black females, but is for all who want to understand the pains of growing up being a poor black female 
 Just as it would be impossible to give you the experience  of tasting an orange thru descriptive words, there is no way  to explain the impact this book and his previous book,  "The Power Of Now", have had on me. My new perspective of Adam & Eve, PMS, world religion, anger, love, compulsive thinking and the second coming are staggeringly sane.    Since I am usually busy, I listen to it while driving 
 I love this book.  Dr Sears is an advocate for attachment parenting.  This book offers useful sections about attachment parenting and suggestions for helping prepare an older sibling for a new baby.  It was priceless for my 3 year old in understanding that babies do not play from day one, that they require a lot of attention, and that she is still as special as she always has been.  I knew my daughter had learned from this book the day she corrected me by saying that the baby was in a baby holder called a uterus, not a belly 
 I remember buying this book when it hit the market, and now I'm buying it for others in my family to read.  I'm sixty now so I've had plenty of time to see lots of games and manipulation, some of which I got pretty good at myself.  No blame or shame involved.  Most families pass down their learned ways of coping to the next generation so this stuff has always been going on.  As I age I am very much less interested in other's games or even my own.  Victims, tears, blame, "you caused my problems" I just leave to their owners.  Life is too full of fun to be manipulated or guilt-tripped by anyone, and I do believe in total responsibility for my life and what happens in it.  Read this and forgive yourself for your games and unplug from other's attempts to control you by any means they can.  This book is one of my favorites!  Recommended reading for those in the pangs of guilt from anyone, even parents or children 
 "What must he give us?"  "Life." "What do we promise him?" "Death."  A book about kids from a coal-mining town playing a game called "Death". This mysterious game takes place in a cave, away from adults. A game where the victim "dies", then comes back from with many "exciting stories" from "death". The characters in this story always seem lost. Each and everyone of them have troubles and conflicts to deal with. The history of  town is filling Kit, the main character, with questions and curiosity.  Who would enjoy reading this book? I think this book is great for anybody ages 12+. Not that anybody younger can't read this book, but it contains situations that are more mature; situations about growing up that are meant for older readers. Also situations about life and death.   This book was written by David Almond, an excellent author. But I think his book "Skellig" is the best 
 I have read only two of Penelope Stokes' books, "Circle of Grace" and "The Blue Bottle Club." I enjoyed both books. "Circle of Grace" is less overtly "Christian," and, I think, the better book. I think Stokes' fans who are disappointed with this book expected something more in the mold of typical Christian fiction. "Circle of Grace" will appeal to a wider audience, but it still has a Christian message 
 I am EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH AND GRATEFUL for this book--the explanations just make good senses. I studied it on a daily basis as I wanted to plan for my workout incorporating all elements of getting and staying fit. I used it as a book "mentor" to encourage me to follow the right stuff in this book. The big pictures he explained in exercise, mind, method, diet, and the long haul strategies is not matched by many books--it's explained so simple and yet so great! I appreciate this book very much. All the good solid honest stuff, no hypes. I'm a little more than beginning-level of training. I'm very disciplined most of the time. You'll benefit very fast if you have some dicipline for exercise. Body for Life gets me started to where I'm now; 3-Minute Abs puts me in another level of learning about fitness. Both of them are exceptional good books for people like me who just wanted to get fit and healthy.  
 Although this 4-disc, 80-song set was released a few years ago, there's good reason that The Disco Box is out front and center on the display shelf for all Christmas shoppers to admire. One look at the silver packaging, reminiscent of the original disco balls that used to hang in our favorite dance clubs, and you'll be pulled in like steel to a magnet. I was immediately impressed with the meticulous array of songs that are laid out in chronological order. The set begins with the birth of disco in 1974 with the Love Unlimited Orchestra's infectious and stunning instrumental "Love's Theme" and takes us all the way through to Kool & the Gangs' #1 smash "Fresh." Of the 78 other tracks, the ride through the 70's and early 80's gets even better with hits that include the original queen of disco Gloria Gaynor and her club anthem "Honeybee," to her successor Donna Summer and the dawn of electronic dance, the brilliant "I Feel Love." If you're looking for rarities, this isn't the set, but if it's radio and club hits such as Carol Douglas' "Doctor's Orders," Candi Staton's "Young Hearts Run Free," Karen Young's "Hot Shot," Sister Sledge's "He's The Greatest Dancer," McFadden & Whitehead's "Ain't No Stopping Us Now," Chic's "Good Times" and Patrice Rushen's "Forget Me Nots," you've come to the right place. And of course, there are the disco staples from Thelma Houston, The Weather Girls, Blondie, Sylvester, Village People, Cheryl Lynn and several more. Didn't see your favorite? Chances are it's on this set. But don't take my word for it, dance on down to the record store and feast your eyes and ears on this exquisite time capsule and the era that we all hold near and dear to our hearts...and feet! Trust me, it's "The Best Disco In Town." Yes, that song is also included. When's the last time you heard dance music this good? Artists are still delivering dance music, just check out Madonna's latest ode to disco, but can you honestly say it's as good as this golden era of music? Pass me a fan and a tambourine - this collection is worth its price in platform shoes.  
 This book is very helpful because it cuts the useless trivia and gets right down to the point. The math section is simplified and makes it easier and faster to answer questions in physics and chemistry once you've learned the techniques. The verbal reasoning section even though very small comparing to other VR books is very powerful. I think it is a perfect book to start with, but you will need to buy more verbal reasoning books to practice 
 Do mind that I'm giving this CD a five star rating - because it really is fantastic. Other than Quentin Tarantino, no director is more aware of the importance of songs in his movies than Cameron Crowe, which perhaps shouldn't be surprising considering his past as a rock journalist, and Almost Famous is one of the best song-based soundtracks I've heard - it's a nostalgic trip through Crowe's youth, as much as the Singles soundtrack was a fascinating exploration of the then-current rock revival, and it has some wonderful, classic songs. There are very few chewed-up mega-hits here; the soundtrack features some excellent, long forgotten artists like Clarence Carter and Thunderclap Newman (whose song, 'Something in the Air', doesn't really appear in the movie, but it's one of my favorites on the album) and some truly grand artists who are not quite as famous as they used to be, like Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers Band. Even from the few huge stars that are featured in the soundtrack, the songs selected by Crowe are not their biggest and most familiar hits, but brilliant and lesser known songs - Led Zeppelin's beautiful acoustic 'That's The Way'; Yes's 'I've Seen All Good People'; David Bowie's performance of the Velvet Underground's 'Waiting For The Man'; and Elton John's 'Tiny Dancer', one of the best songs he'd ever written, which predates his time as a mega-star.  And it's specifically because the music in Almost Famous is so good that this soundtrack is not quite satisfactory. The fantastic songs that appear in the film but are not on this soundtrack are almost too many to list - 'Search and Destroy' by the Stooges, 'Everybody Knows This is Nowhere' by Neil Young , 'Teacher' by Jethro Tull, 'River' by Joni Mitchell, 'Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters' by Elton John, 'Burn' by Deep Purple, 'Future Games' by Fleetwood Mac, 'Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)' by Jimi Hendrix, 'Sweet Leaf' by Black Sabbath, 'Misty Mountain Hop', 'Tangerine', 'Bron-Y-Aur' and 'The Rain Song' all by Led Zeppelin, 'My Cherie Amour' by Stevie Wonder - featured in one of the film's most beautiful moments. And there are more. It seems only natural to have released the soundtrack as a double album, or at least to release a second part with as many of these songs as possible. I also think it would have been incredible appropriate to include 'Cover of the Rolling Stone' by Dr. Hook (written by the great Shel Silverstein), which the band members sing in another one of the film's great scene.  Most of all, I'm missing the original Stillwater tracks, all written by Peter Frampton, Wayne Kirkpatrick and Gordon Kennedy. 'Fever Dog' is the only one that's in here, but the other great songs - 'You Had to Be There', 'Love Thing', 'Chance Upon You', 'Hour of Need' and 'Love Comes and Goes' - all of which run through film's many concert segments - can currently only be heard by buying the 2-Disc Director's Cut DVD, and that's a real shame. These are all fantastic rock songs, with great sound, great musicianship and great production (Frampton's mark can really be heard on them) and they should be released. I would rather see them on the soundtrack than classics that can be found on various classic albums from that time (e.g. Led Zeppelin III, Simon & Garfunkel's Bookends, Elton John's Madman Across the Water).  But hey, these are my two cents. It's still a great album. I love the idea of younger listeners who weren't previously familiar with this great music and are getting into it because of the movie. For those, and for anyone who loved the movie, this soundtrack is a great buy, but also check out some the albums I mentioned above, as well as Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland, Elton John's Honky Chateau, Black Sabbath's Master of Reality, Jethro Tull's Living in the Past, and Led Zeppelin's ZOSO - all of which contain songs which are in the film. I'm entirely convinced that that's what Mr. Crowe wants you to do, too 
 This is a great book.  Written in a very methodical, logical and clear style.  Everything that is needed to turn some of Tibbet's magnificent bowls is included and he maeks it looks so stratightforward.  My only recommedation to the author would be to include more photographs of his lathes and the setup of some of his projects, this would be of interest, but does not detract from the book at all.  What I most admire is the willingness of such artists to share their work.   I suspect this has something to do with his philosophny "Sharing leads to innovation..."  nothing could be more true.  Ale 
 The story starts with the plot to terminate one "inconvenient" whistle-blower (Faith Lockhart).  The unexpected complication is a burglarizing P.I. (Lee Adams) who frustrates the assassination and rescues the damsel in distress.  Congress is involved as well as the CIA and FBI.  The 451 page adventuresome chase is through double-crossing who-can-you-trust terrain.  The romance is unsurprising, typical, and some of the best dialog.  The 'run and hide for your  life' is great suspense.  The counter attack/sting is pure Baldacci brilliance.  Saving Faith gives you a front-row seat to a great adventure/mystery but doles out the background details necessary to full understanding one plot twist at a time 
 A tough read for someone in the initial stages of divorce.  The books contains great information to help the divorced parents understand what the children will experience in the years ahead.  I think it is great to know this so that the divorced parents can take measures to eliminate or minimize the effects of the divorce on the children for years to come.  
  There are some magnificent, some great and some merely competent interpretations of Leonard Cohen's music on this soundtrack album. First the highlights. Tower Of Song by Martha Wainwright with its intricate guitars is a powerful interpretation of the classic. The lilting and sensual Tonight Will Be Fine by Teddy Thompsom is magnificent - his voice sounds similar to that of Springsteen.   Then comes the tremulous and atmospheric Winter Lady by Kate & Anna McGarrigle and Martha Wainwright, a true gem. Beth Orton does a splendid version of Sisters Of Mercy with her slow and emphatic enunciation supported by lovely backing vocals. Perla Batalla's Bird On A Wire and The Traitor by Martha Wainwright with its opening trumpets are great, and both have exquisite instrumentation.   The weaving voices of Nick Cave, Julie Christensen and Perla Batalla make Suzanne quite special, whilst Teddy Thompson does justice to The Future in this rhythmic, uptempo version of the eerie song with its apocalyptic vision of the future. The evocative Anthem is a duet between Batalla and Christensen, a classic interpretation with soulful organ and uplifting vocals.  I found the following tracks competent but not really exceptional: The sax-heavy I'm Your Man by Nick Cave, Chelsea Hotel by Rufus Wainwright, the soulful If It Be Your Will by Antony, I Can't Forget by Jarvis Cocker, Famous Blue Raincoat by the Handsome Family and the breezy Everybody Knows by Rufus Wainwright.  Although not a fan of U2, I love the concluding track  Tower of Song by Cohen and Bono. The voices work well together and the instrumentation is superb.  Fans of Leonard might also be interested in the other tribute albums: Famous Blue Raincoat by Jennifer Warnes, Democracy by Judy Collins, I'm Your Fan by a colourful array of artists from different musical backgrounds and the slightly tepid Tower of Song by a selection of mostly country singers. 
 David Bach's book Automatic Millionaire has really changed my wife and my life and it has set us on the road to a great retirement.  So after getting the Automatic Millionaire we also got David Bach's Smart Couples Audio CD and while it is pretty much the same as the Automatic Millionaire it was nice to have it geared towards couples.  The only real advantage was that it showed that my wife and I both have the same goals (other than retiring rich), and for those couples who do not it may be a great way for those couples to realize their partner's goals together and work to include them in their own life plan.  I would suggest getting the Automatic Millionaire first and then go from there.   Thanks again David Bach!! 
 I've an avid reader of WWII literature for many years now.  I don't ususally post reviews, but, I have to say that this book is one of the best books I've read about the war.  As much as I like reading about battles, tactics, weapons, etc, this book is filled with that and so much more.  The compassion of the author for his fellow soldiers is something that is missing from many memoirs, but it isn't only compassion, more so his actions and witness accounts of what happens in the midst of battles.  Although it is fair to say that many memoirs talk about the above mentioned topics from one degree to another, this book does something more which I doubt anyone can describe well enough with words.  It will stay with me for a long time as being one of the best memoirs of the war 
 DuBrul does a decent job with his first book in the Philip Mercer Series. The action is little wan, and several situations that Mercer takes over, I found myself envisioning a guy in a blue suit, red cape, with a big "S" on his chest. Forge is not bad as a first book, but it certainly does not compare to later hits like, "Medussa Stone" or "River of Ruin".  But good nonetheless. DrBrul does present a sense of history for some of his characters which flows through to other books, and gives the characters like, Harry and Dick Henna a sense of worth and understanding when they materialize in the other books.  Overall, this is a good read, and one worthy of Mercer fans 
  I first read this book at a time when I was deeply unhappy in my work life. I was hoping to find some answers or at least direction. Like Palmer, I was confused about my life's purpose and disturbed by the meaninglessness of my days. How could I feel so poor when surrounded by so much abundance? I wasn't looking for (and didn't need) some pop-culture fix; I was searching for something more meaningful to help me explore my life.  What *Let Your Life Speak* gave me was a clear and honest story of one man's search for meaning in the midst of plenty. I related to Palmer's frustrations, neediness, searching, and displacement. I learned about myself by understanding how he revealed his own myths and faced his realities.   And like Palmer, I found my life reinvigorated once I exposed and cleared away the underbrush.  This book is not a "how-to" but a "think-deeply". Palmer writes clearly and candidly in a voice that is gentle and trustworthy. I've gone back to this book many times for inspiration and recommended it often.   This is a beautifully written contemplation on life and meaning 
 I liked it cause it was in depth. They told all about the characters then they told the story 
 I love movies. All kinds. But this particular film holds a special interest for me. When I first saw this movie, it was about 10 years after it was made. I had heard about the movie, heard that Michael Keaton's character dies of cancer. So I was a little reluctant to watch a movie about someone dying of cancer when I had just lost my father to the disease. The same exact form of cancer Michael Keaton's character is fighting in the movie. This particular form of cancer is not as common and highly uncurable, so naturally, I was a little surprised that this film depicted this type of cancer. But I have to say that  the screenwriter for this film did his homework and did it well. The film does an excellent job of depicting the effects of kidney cancer and the path the disease takes.  I am confident that anyone who has dealt with the fight against cancer will relate to this film, and recommend it, as do I. Even if you have never had an experience with cancer, I would still recommend that you watch this film. It might give you some insight on the complications with cancer and the effects it has on family and the lives of those involved. Not matter how many times I see this movie, it gets to me every time. I highly recommend this film 
 This is such a great read!  Can't pass it up.  Reminds me a lot of jackie collins.  This story is so much fun.  It has so many surprises...I think you'll be shocked, not predictable 
  I just finished using this book for an undergradutate Neurobiology class at Harvard University, and found it to be very informative. It has a number of diagrams and illustrations, and clearly describes various aspects of neuroscience in great detail,  but in a comprehensive manor. I recommend it to anyone pursuing a career in neuroscience. 
 I love electronica, I like orchestral music. In this release they have the perfect union. Even my friends who have a hard time listening to electronic/ambient music really, really like this release. If you are a serious music aficionado you must own this. This is a stunning piece of work that will spin on and on in all types of players and in all kinds of places 
 This is a good book for the player looking for more equipment options.  It especially adds some eastern weapons.  But it would have been nice to find more weapons, armor, and special material options.  An 'Arms & Equipment Guide' that spends 14 pages on weapons & armor and 17 pages on vehicles (!) is a little out of balance.  More of the good stuff.  But overall a helpful book.  A 3.5 update would be nice 
 I have read many books about writing and the creative process, yet few have reached me the way Poemcrazy has. Woolridge's love of life and words sings out from every page. Her writing is alive and enthusiastic, and her practice suggestions are stimulating. She gives enough detail, guidance and encouragement that it is easy to start writing.  Her enthusiasm is contagious; this is the only book about writing that I've put down not to consider a passage but to reach for my notebook and pen. Where many books portray writing practice as a dreaded but necessary chore, Woolridge's prompts made me eager to write 
 I am reading this book all over again for the, hmm, I really have lost count - let's just say the umpteenth time. Reading it was supposed to be a "filler" until the time I could lay my hands on an as yet unread book. Needless to say, though I have other books in line now, I am completely drawn in and am not willing to give up reading Pride and Prejudice till I reach "The End" again.  This is a book which keeps growing on you and you like it even more on each subsequent reading. The characterization is simply brilliant. The dialogues, though too convoluted and flowery by today's standards, are a treat to read. The characters are all mostly likeable. Though it is supposed to be a romance, there is a whole lot more to the book. Each reading brings out subtler shades and makes you nod your head delighted as the new facet presents itself!  Pride and Prejudice has to be one of my most favorite books of all time. I can read it any time and love it all over again. You are missing out on a real treat if you have not read it yet - go get it :-)!  Another note: I think because the protagonist is female, women tend to enjoy this book a whole lot more than men 
 `Oriental Vegetables' by English gardening writer Joy Larkcom is the real deal. For foodies like myself, the most important thing to know about the book is exactly what deal it is real. I bought it with a bunch of other books on Asian ingredients without paying attention to much about the book except for the title, being lead to it by Amazon's cleverly surfacing books related to the books you have already chose to buy. Especially do not be deceived by the very nice blurb on the cover from Alice Waters and play extra attention to the subtitle, `The Complete Guide for the Gardening Cook'.  This book is much more about gardening than it is about cooking, and it tackles the subject of gardening very, very well. It does an exceptionally good job on detailing for us the ins and outs of growing the primary subject of the book, oriental vegetables.  The very best news about this book is that it was published 14 years ago, just as commerce between the West and China and Indochina was warming up. This trade has had these 14 years to mature into something that makes the access to unusual seeds even easier. A corollary to this is the fact that the book also predates the blooming of the Internet, so most of the sources Ms. Larkcom gives from the UK, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan will probably be joined by others and be themselves more accessible.  Ms. Larkcom began her inquiry into her subject already an expert on growing vegetables. She enhanced her credentials by making long trips to China and Japan and by enlisting the assistance of a large stable of translators. All of this linguistic help was probably even more necessary for Oriental plants, as the systematic naming of plants in China and Japan is probably far behind that in the west, plus the fact that there are simply so many different species to deal with. I have seen in other horticultural books that China is the source of far more plant species than any comparable region on the earth. Even a cursory look at Ms. Larkcom's table of contents gives weight to this observation. This lists 77 species or groups of species by  `common name'. This is substantially less than Elizabeth Schneider's approximately135 species covered in `Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini', but this book is limited to less than a quarter of the world's land mass while Schneider covers the entire world (as seen from western Europe).  If you already own Bruce Cost's classic `Oriental Ingredients', you have not touched the surface of what Larkcom's book can offer. Cost gives us the culinary and economic scoop. Ms. Larkcom focuses on the horticultural.  Ms. Larkcom's favorite subject may very well be the cabbages, as they are her first subject and she lovingly describes them as being very easy to grow in western soils and climates. In her general introduction to these brassicas, she covers climatic factors, stages of use, fitting the oriental brassicas into Western gardens, cultivation, pests and diseases, grouping the oriental brassicas, and specific hybrid brassicas. The introductory section finishes up with an excellent diagram of how oriental brassicas are related. This may do nothing to improve your salads or stir-frys, but it's great in helping to choose substitutes when one species is out of season and a related species is in full bloom.  For each individual species, Ms. Larkcom follows Bruce Cost's practice by giving the most common English name, the biological family, the two part Latin name, other common English names, plus names in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Japanese. Even among the Mandarin and Cantonese speakers, some plants may have several different names. After this linguistic heading, there are paragraphs on background, use, characteristics, types, climate, soil, cultivation, intercropping, pests and disease, harvesting, storage, and varieties. Whew! All this information includes a culinary aspect I have simply not seen elsewhere. This is the fact that several plants go through different stages and while some stages may be commercially less desirable in western eyes, they are really quite highly prized by Oriental users.  After Brassicas, the other major groups of plants are beans, cucurbits (gourds and melons), onions, radishes, water vegetables, tubers, and herbs and wild plants. If I were to take away one plant from this book and give it a shot at growing in my back yard, it would probably be the radishes. The rich assortment of oriental radishes is in strong contrast to the variety available in even a better than average American megamart.  The biggest surprise I found was that ginger received a light coverage as an herb and its relative, galangal is not mentioned at all. I am certain this is because neither of these two plants is easy to grow in home gardens, and growing is what this book is all about. This reinforces the fact that for the foodie with a black thumb, this book needs a companion with a culinary focus to fill out one's picture of Oriental veggies.  The main body of the book dealing with individual plants is supplemented with an excellent chapter on growing techniques. I am not as familiar with the soil as I am with the stove, but from what I can see, this chapter is first rate, covering techniques which you may not find in your average Better Homes and Gardens title. This is followed by a chapter on cooking which is even better than what I saw in other books on vegetables where the emphasis was more on cooking than in this horticulturally slanted book.  The appendices to this book alone are worth the price of admission with its excellent tables of gardening terms, growing calendars, plant names, and bibliographies. While there is some danger that the references to suppliers may be out of date, I do recognize several current major players such as W. Atlee Burpee and Johnny's Selected Seeds.  If any of this interests you, this book is for you! 
   What there was is good.  I like the premise, I like the character development, I like the sub-plots, I like the guest stars, I like the writing, I'ld like to have paid for more than SIX episodes 
 This was a movie I "grew up" with and was delighted to see it again especially in DVD. It brought back many happy memories 
 Yep, im sorry to say that this album is far better than the movie itself, if anyone loves hard rock, this soundtrack is for you 
 I read this book on a sort of whim, because I'd been harboring a copy about a hundred years old (cloth cover, and kind of cool in it's own right), and because I had just read 'The Eyre Affair' by Jasper Fforde.  In his story, the plot for Jane Eyre gets 're-written' to have a 'newer and more popular ending'. While Jasper Fforde is as loopy as Douglas Adams, that is another review. He seizes on something great though, which is the last section of the book where Jane has gone off from Rochester, and (under terrible pressure) is next to assenting to go off to India with her cousin to work herself to death and bear his children.  In the Fforde story, that is how Jayne Eyre ends, until his heroine Thursday Next comes in and sets things on a different path.  But enough of that.  It's worth mentioning that I was intrigued by the glimpse I got of the story from a single remove.  I am very glad I was compelled to read it.  I found Jane Eyre very enjoyable, and as I mentioned very modern in many of it's features, from plot movement,to the confidential nature of the narrator's speech, to a certain darker caste, which, while gothic certainly, is also the color of the paper that nearly every screenplay and t.v. script is written on today.  The rush & dash of the romance is first rate, and I am sure it was ground breaking when it was written.  I look forward to reading a morsel more from each of the Bell (Eyre) sisters 
 I highly recommend this book.  A well detailed account of the development of scientific racism in the West, showing that it has become a deeply rooted and fundamental aspect of our culture.  An another important book on the subject is "The Aryan Myth" by Ivan Polikov, but Hannaford's  work concentrates in the evolution of racist thinking in scientific  circles, and links much of its influence to pseudo-scientific occult  theories, and in particular, the Jewish Kabbalah.  According to the  Hannaford, racist theories developed from the Kabbalistic interpretation of  the curse of Ham, and it was the the Kabbalistic science of physiognomy,  the study of facial features with the goal of recognizing the elect, that  introduced type-thinking to the West.  What makes Hannaford's work stand  out from others of its kind, is his establishment of this most important  conncection.  I only gave the book 4 stars, because, unfortunately, I don't  believe he explored the subject sufficiently. .. 
 This is a very nice book for advanced artists.  It is helpful in understanding different types of dragons and mythical creatures.  It describes different body, head, and wing types.  I would recommend this book for anyone who has a lot of interest in fantasy drawing 
 We own several of Dane Zanes' CDs, but this is the one that's currently in my car's CD player. Consequently, I've listened to it approximately a zillion times in the past month.   The good news? My 3 and 6 year olds love it, and both enjoy singing along. It hasn't driven me insane yet, and I'm actually quite fond of "Malti" and a couple of the other songs. My 3 year old has learned to count to 10 in Spanish. The CD comes packaged in a board book, and both girls enjoy looking at the book as we drive. My older daughter has learned to properly pronounce "Edinburgh."  The bad news? I wake up in the morning and find myself humming "Fooba Wooba John" or "Yo Yo." I think these songs are permanently imprinted in my brain. A couple of the other songs are a little boring.   I think kids of most ages will enjoy this CD, and grownups won't hate it. It's not my favorite of the genre, but it makes a nice addition to our car music rotation. Oh, and if you visit Zanes' website, most of the song lyrics are posted there. I wish they were printed in the board book so the kids could read along 
 I keep this devotional at my bedside, and the simple rituals "bookend" my day -- it's the first thing I reach for in the morning, and the last thing I read before falling asleep.   The Celtic Devotional is an excellent guide through the seasons of the Celtic year, while bringing a sense of the sacred to each and every day. Each season has poem-prayers, and activities that can be done throughout the period for a "big picture" approach to spirituality. In addition, the daily devotional framework provides time and "space" for silence, movement, active meditation on a question or issue, and lyrical prayers, that are as rich with meaning as the most complex poems.  The sturdy, hardcover book is beautifully decorated with Celtic knot designs, primitive woodblocked images, and areas of illuminated text. While it seems that this would make the book too "busy" to look at comfortably, I find the variety of artistic styles enriching. There's always something different to look at -- something reflective of each season.  Finally, I love the selection of prayers at the back of the book for nearly every occasion you can think of. Some I have used in personal ritual practices, some I find comforting, and their brevity makes them ideal for meditation.  If you have an interest in Celtic Pagan Spirituality, or even Celtic Christianity, I would urge you to explore this book to help you make your spiritual explorations concrete 
 i saw this show on PBS and was so enthralled with it that i just had to order it.  the performances are priceless from folks who have passed on.  i don't know of any other way to be able to see Yul Brynner's commanding King and I performance.  Loved it 
 the bad boy family are great but dis album just makes it even bette 
 Any film that features Gene Krupa and Shelly Manne on the track is worth seeing.  It would have been nice to have more music included, such as the songs that featured Roy Eldridge, as well as Anita O'Day.  Sal Mineo carried off the Krupa role with great style.  For swing fans, it's a "must see." Tony Horowitz [... 
 I found Carroll's book extremely compelling and interesting.  His detailed description of the lengthy and "unchristian" relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and Judaism was very well documented and very enlightening. However, I found that he missed an extremely important point in his description of this history, namely that the very continuing existence of Judaism after the time of Jesus possibly undercuts the validity of Christianity.  If supersessionism is wrong (a possibility) and Judaism is correct regarding the divinity of Jesus, then the totality of the Chritian message about itself collapses.  Thus historic Judaism was a threat to the very existence of Christianity because if Judaism's denial of the messianic claims regarding Jesus are correct, Christianity is incorrect and not a valid religion. This possibility is a major threat to historic Christian "faith" and the whole saga that Carroll portrays represents this threat in so many ways.  However, he never really deals with such a possibility, which I find under lies the historic relationship he details.   I find this a major shortcoming of his otherwise outstanding, detailed and fine history of Roman Catholic anti-Judaism. 
 this book was really helpful in understanding how much marketing work is involved with doing art. it's a little intimidating to think that you will need to write press-releases for everything you do. but thats' the truth i guess if you want to play the game. that is if you want to play by and set your own rules instead of just being a tool for the whims of gallerists and dealers 
 On December 14, 1944, as American troops under General Douglas MacArthur slowly advanced toward the island of Luzon, Japanese guards at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp on Palawan committed a terrible act. Herding their Allied war prisoners into trenches, they soaked the men with fuel and burned them alive.  Utah native Eugene Nielsen, private first class in the 59th Coast Artillery, was one of the few who escaped. Filipino guerrillas transported the survivors to the island of Morotai, where Nielsen described his experience to an Army intelligence officer. News of the massacre reached the POWs at Cabanatuan, as well, and prompted the U.S. Army to embark on one of the war's most dramatic missions -- the Bataan  
 It is always hard to judge a product by a picture. They looked dark on my computer, but I ordered them anyway because I liked the graphic.I am so glad I did. They are actually a steel blue and they look great. I am very pleased and have recieved many compliments. They were easy to install and the quality exceded my expectations. I would recommend them to anyone who loves fairys. 
 So I love the Dandy Warhols and ALL their albums but I have to say that this is my absolute favorite.  It is a brilliant mix of all the BEST music---The Velvet Underground, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Iggy Pop and everything good inbetween.  There is a song for every mood on this album...songs to dance to and songs to relax to...Overall 13 Tales from Urban Bohemia is the perfect mix for anyone who loves a variety of music and Bohemians everywhere! Give it a LISTEN 
 This is a book that teaches you to play, the history, the rules... for beginning to play is just righ 
 Jim Steinman's a pretty odd bloke. Let us not forget that this man - ne, genius - created a rock opera based on Peter Pan. Certainly plausible (the roots of many mythical tales are damn freaky), but clearly insane, Jim Steinman is a songwriter like no other. Certainly one of the best songwriters of our age, arguably of all time.  "Dead Ringer" was one of two albums Jim Steinman assembled in 1981, the other being the definitive "Bad For Good". Both were intended for Meat Loaf, but he stormed out of the "BFG" recordings, thus leaving him with "Dead Ringer". And though "BFG" clearly got more than it's fair share of the better material, the fact of the matter is that there's not a bad track on "Dead Ringer". This is one-hundred percent musical matery.  Jim Steinman seperates himself from most musical minds by being truly diverse. You don't normally get this much variety in songs from an album full of different songwriters, much less all on the one. "Dead Ringer" is a roller-coaster ride taking you from heavy rock through to beautiful love-drenched ballads and back again (often doing this across the course of each song) - seven stunning tracks that have to be heard to be believed.  Let's take, for example, the album's centrepiece (and original title-track) "I'll Kill You If You Don't Come Back". This track kicks off with a guitar riff of which most axe-gods would be proud (stunning considering it's written by a pianist), launching into a heavy-rock spectacular that could easily be the stage-standout of any rock act on the planet. But then, about halfway through, the song slides from being an angst-rock song into being a powerful piano-driven ballad. It's two songs - the same tagline, the same title, but two completely different tracks. And it works. This is an example of Steinman's mastery, completely unlike anything seen on "Bat Out Of Hell", but definitive in it's own, special way.  Not all the songs are so varied within themselves, however. "Read 'em and Weep" is one of the finest ballads that Steinman ever wrote, for example. Smacking a bit of "Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad", to be blatantly honest, but doing it in it's own special way, "Read 'em and Weep" is as much of a classic as anything else that Meat has ever sung, including the stuff on the "Bat" albums. It's not a ballad in the most typical sense - not like "Heaven Can Wait" or "For Crying Out Loud" from the 1977 LP - it's got guitars and drums and the works, but it's still emotionally driven and quite touching.  The only other track that really qualifies as a ballad on this record is the closer, "Everything Is Permitted". This dark, sinister track, is sometimes not immediately obvious. It's not immediately brilliant, either, but give it time and it'll grow on you. This is probably the worst of Meat Loaf's closers (his albums are known for finishing on highs - "For Crying", "Where Angels Sing" being the most obvious standouts), but that said, it's still a pretty impressive song. "More Than You Deserve" is, of course, a part of Meat Loaf lore. The version found here was actually recorded (or so the liner notes suggest) in 1974, but I'm not so sure about that. At any rate, it's not a song that I ever really appreciated, and I remain with mixed feelings about it today. The version found on "Storytellers" is far superior.  For all these ballads and slower tracks, the album has it's share of explosive rock, as well. "Peel Out", the album opener, rips along at a rate of knots. People often confuse this song with having illusions of "Bat Out Of Hell", but it's nothing of the sort. They're two completely different songs, and there's no comparison between them. "Peel Out" never got much in the way of recognition, but that doesn't mean it's a bad song. The other, obvious, rock track on the album is, of course, "Dead Ringer For Love" itself. This track is a duet with Cher, and, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you that there's a reason that this was one of Meat Loaf's most successful singles until "I'd Do Anything...". The band gallop along at one hell of a pace as Meat and Cher exchange barbs and upleasantries in one of Steinman's better short efforts.  Which leaves just one song. A song that is...well, more or less indescribable. A song that has a bit of everything. A song that (and I better whisper this) is perhaps one of the three best songs that Meat Loaf ever sang. From it's dark and moody piano and bass opening, through to it's explosive heavy-guitar climax, "I'm Gonna Love Her" is not only musically diverse, but also lyrically stunning, as Meat pleads with his best friend to stop mistreating the woman they mutually love. He's "gonna love her for both of" them. And it's a good thing, too. Because if he wasn't so assertive, then we wouldn't have this song. It's got a bit of everything. It's epic, but it doesn't feel like it. A true Steinman masterwork.  So, where's the inevitable "Bat" comparison? It's not so inevitable after all. Sure, "Bat Out Of Hell" and "Dead Ringer" are both albums written by Jim Steinman, and sung by Meat Loaf, but in so many ways they're each their own, independent entities that it's unfair to compare them. "Dead Ringer" is every bit as good an album as "Bat". Enjoy it for what it is - don't criticise it for what it isn't.  
 My son got this cookie recipe book through a school book order when he was very young, maybe 1st or 2nd grade. That was in the early 1980s and I am still using it, held together with tape. Glad to see copies are still available...It's the kind of book you don't want to stop using, with such a variety of cookie recipes and plenty of "favorites." Color illustrations of some of the cookies are a nice accompaniment to the recipes. Especially handy during the holidays but good year-round 
 Mr Critser starts his study by explaining that palm oil was introduced in the US in the 1970s, cheaper and tastier than vegetable oil but containing 45 % saturated fat. At the same time, soft drink companies switched to high-fructose syrup saving the companies 20 % in sweetener costs and allowing the production of calorie-dense convenience food, the so-called "TV dinners". Still at the same time, meat production soared world-wide as feed costs of soy meal and corn fell. And so at fast food stands, portions became bigger and cheaper. "Value meals" became popular and the presence of more food for the same amount of money induced people to eat more. By the end of the 20th century, supersizing reigned in the fast food world. Another factor responsible for the rise of obesity is the habit of consuming high-calorie snacks between meals, particularly in schools where most cafeterias stopped cooking proper meals anyway in the favour of "outsourcing" - contracting an outside source to deliver pre-plated meals. The author then shows how obesity is associated with high levels of religiosity and how obesity is made to a cult on TV with some popular singers revering their own overweight body in their lyrics. Other factors contribute to obesity: lack of physical education in schools, disproportionate TV-viewing (where up to 40% of children advertising is for high-fat foods) which can lead children to develop type 2 diabetes, particularly among the working poor who have the "impulse to eat for today, tomorrow being a tentative proposition at best". Poverty, class and income are thus the key determinants of obesity. A report from the RAND/University of Chicago states that "The economic and personal health costs of overweight and obesity are enormous and compromise the health of the United States." Finally, in the last chapter the author suggests a series of measures to improve the current situation. An altogether well-researched and valuable study which tackles various issues: social, medical, economic, educational, cultural and culinary 
 R.E.M. is, without question, one of the best bands to ever emerge. Whether you like them or not is not up for discussion - they have created an enormously impressive and entertaining back catalog since their debut album came out in 1983. The songs most people will know from "Document" are the hits "The One I Love" and "It's The End Of The World As We Know It (and I Feel Fine)", and while these are indeed classic songs the rest hold up surprisingly well! The first song, "Finest Workshop", is another amazing song that has become one of my personal R.E.M. favorites. As opposed to their later albums like "Out Of Time", "Document" is less poppier and more artistic - while that album was also great you can tell that a lot more thought and energy was poured into this one. Every song here is good-if-not-amazing, and I'm pretty confident in saying that most people in the world will love them. Part of this is due to Michael Stipe's incredible vocals, but it's also because every song is catchy and very fun to listen to. Michael Stipe, while not as emotional as on "Automatic For The People", for example, still proves that he is one of the industry's best and most unique singers (along with Bono, Sting and Thom Yorke...etc). I'm pretty sure that no one in their right mind couldn't like him. The lyrics are, as always, very interesting to listen to as well as deep, and most of these songs are incredibly catchy and memorable (the two hits and "Finest Worksong", especially). Musically the album sounds like 80's pop rock with R.E.M.'s signature "jangle pop" guitar style - you can definitely understand why this was such an influential album when it came out in 1987 (though their earlier ones were more so). The only negative comment I could make about this album is that it's in need of a good remastering - the audio quality isn't bad, but you can tell that it could probably be much better. Basically folks, if you like great music or R.E.M. then "Document", along with every other early R.E.M. album, will soon become one of your favorites. Absolutely recommended!  Highlights include: the entire album 
 Wizards of the Coast has spent the last 10 years looking at revamping and updating the game. It finally went forth and produced a new version that many people initially rebelled against but were largely won over. Then they immediately updated that update (3 to 3.5), again rebellion and acceptance. When WotC began churning out the supplement books they all tended to lack something or be filled with confusion or fluff material. Finally they rounded up a huge variety and cross-section of spells from a multitude of sources, revamped them and slapped them into a book... the Spell Compendium.  The SC is quite good, almost too good compared to the other supplements released. Some great new spells have arisen for us without collecting hundreds of dollars worth of other books. Sure there are errors and some spells are pretty serious for their levels but for the greater degree, this is quite good. I found it has inspired my players to finally begin researching and coming up with their own variants of spells based on existing ones. You'll find spells you could care less about and others you will drool over, it's a huge variety sure to please the spellcasting characters. Just be careful how you introduce them into your campaign.  Overall, errors exist, power is amped, spell variety is wonderful and allows for a nice collection of directional based spellcasters (one of mine is using many earth and wind based spells). Price-wise - it's still well worth it at your average game store cost of $35. My players and I are much pleased with this contribution to the game 
 Cheiro brings this art of Palmistry from the root of India to almost everyone who wants to know about their destiny and he does this in a very elaborate manner so that one would become a pro. after he read this book.  Hats off to Cheiro 
 I find it funny that there's a unicorn logo on the front cover of my copy of this book, saying that this work is Adult Fantasy. About the only thing Adult about H.P. Lovecraft is that he uses big words like "cacodaemoniacal". Although most of the works in this collection are fantasy, that doesn't mean that there isn't any horror to be had, either. Some of the stories in this excellent collection will give you more chills than the Sixth Sense ever did. Here's a brief synopsis of some of the stories in this book: THE OTHER GODS--One of my favorite fantasy pieces. It deals with mankind driving the gods up mountains. BEYOND THE WALL OF SLEEP--A primitive man from the mountains is put in an institution, where the main character discovers something extraordinary about the fellow. EX OBLIVIONE--Travel to a wonderful dream-world with a bronze gate that leads somewhere seemingly special. FROM BEYOND--This story reminded me much of The Sixth Sense. Lovecraft was never one for dialogue, but he did really well in this story. THE CATS OF ULTHAR--An elderly couple is suspected of cat-killing, but a boy passing through has thoughts of revenge. HONORABLE MENTIONS: The Tree, The Tomb, Polaris, What the Moon Brings, Hypnos, Nathicana, The Festival, The Nameless City, The Quest of Iranon, The Crawling Chaos, and In the Walls of Eryx. As you can see, you get lots of bang for your buck, so to speak. The stories are categorized, but they do not appear in chronological order--a partial chronology is included at the back. This is probably the best Lovecraft book I've read since The Best of H.P. Lovecraft. Both books are worth getting 
 One of the books that should be on any parent's shelves. Easy to read, but detailed 
 After DVD #4 in this series turned into a recap, it is quite a relief to find the story underway again, with all of the characters following one path or another towards Jaguera's keep.  Most viewers don't realize that this is a 30 episode series (the last four are an OVA), but even with that much remaining, these episodes are tense and exciting as we build to our first chilling meeting with the darkest of the Nobles.  The opening episodes follow Tsume, Toboe,  and Hige in their search for Kiba.  As hope dims their irritation with each other mounts only the discovery of a native tribe calleed the Hmong (very much echo our own Navaho and Hopi cultures) manages to keep the peace.  There the wolves are accepted, and we first encounter the legend that it was wolves that were the first people, from whom humans were made.  This experience makes so great an impression on Toboe that he feels a strong urge to remain with the human tribe.  Kiba, in the meantime, seems to have wandered into a version of paradise.  It is a beautiful world of woods and water where he meets a beautiful feline (My) who seems to be his soul mate.  Gradually we realize that, for all his happiness, he is in danger of forgetting both Cheza and his quest.  Finally they are reunited, and the wolves start out again after Cheza, somehow closer together for all their experiences.  The wolves come upon a battle between Jaguera's troops and the remaining soldiers of  a large city.  The join in and are directed to Jaguera's castle when the seek clues about Cheza's whereabouts.  Next, attention moves to the fates of Cheza, Blue, Hubb, and Cher.  Several battles trigger a great deal of path crossing and the four are first reunitied and then split up to make their way to the final confrontation.  Then we are back with the wolves on their trip across a sea of ice.  This brings about one of the most dramatic fights of the series as Toboe suddenly comes of age as a wolf and ceases to be the runt of the litter in one spectacular moment.  Finally we come to Jaguera's keep for one final chilling image.  Once again, we know why this has been a consistently excellent series.  One of the things that make this series so memorable is the consistent attention to character development.  So many anime hold themselves to a minimal amount of character writing.  We rarely see characters like go through the kind of development that Quent Yaiden work's through as he realizes that Blue is a wolf, not the family dog, or Toboe's remarkable turnabout in this DVD.  We wind up caring as much about the characters as we do the plot, as much impressed by their depth as we are by the artwork and music.  Wolf's Rain turns into a memorable experience, rather than just an entertainment.  I cannot recommend this series enough 
 I just finished reading Alesandro Duranti's 1997 book for my linguistic anthropology core class. I wanted to take the opportunity here to comment on this book. A. Duranti goes through all of the major theoretical underpinnings and morphological manifestations that the discipline has endured since its inception from the likes of Boas and Sapir in the early 20th century. It has changed and gone through many necessary changes during its lifetime. In order to truly place our finger on the intentions of the "other," we must strive to open a dialogue with the "other" through the practice of speaking, analysis of discourse, and make assumptions based on interpretations to better understand the cultural baggage each one of us carries. This is healthy and natural, and summarizes what it means to be human. Linguistic anthropology taps into human psychology, and the social enterprise in many ways that I have never been able to imagine. A. Duranti eloquently explains linguistic anthropology's rightful place as a science and a discipline worthy of perpetuation in posterity. I sincerely hope others read it in order to assist in this perpetuation of what it means to be human through the practice of speaking 
 I lent this book to a friend who said it was like reading one long poem.Another friend burst into tears during her message to thank me for convincing her to read it. It is truly one of the most beautiful pieces of writing you are likely to come across - yet so simple and brief. Perfect in every way. I first read it about 6 years ago and many times since. In fact my local book shop gave me a first addition for free as I seem to be its biggest fan. Magnificent  
 This is book is collection of Interviews by Noam Chomsky given before and after the attacks on the WTC.   I found this book a little too brief and would recommend to first time readers of this author to read some of his other work and then come to this particular book.  This book is nonetheless an Interesting view to take on the events that are discussed in it 
 I gave this as a gift.  The person who received it liked it very much and was happy with it 
 When we first bought this book for my then two-year old daughter, I could barely get through it the first time.  I didn't much like it.  That's probably because I was so busy trying to say the words it, I couldn't pay attention to what was actually happening.  Since then, the book has grown on me, and my now three-year old daughter loves it, as well.  After reading the book aloud a gazillion times, I can now say it almost without getting my tongue twisted, and my favorite part is the ending, where Knox finally gets his "revenge" for what Fox has put him through.  One minor complaint:  Seuss uses the word "dumb," a word I would prefer to keep out of my daughter's vocabulary, and it could easily have been replaced with "glum," a change I try to institute when I read the book 
 Whether you think you can or can't, you're right. Likewise, whether or not you think this book will help you or not, you're right...  This is a follow-up to Joe's wildly successful "How to Sell Anything." In so many ways, it's much more of what most would call a self-help, not sales, book. I think we can all agree that carrying oneself with a confident, assured, and positive attitude is imperative in sales. It also happens to help in the rest of life, which, when we think about it, requires us to become self-made men and women (silver-spooners excepted). So, in that light, maybe it is a "sales" book after all. That's Joe's point.  Check out Joe's discussion of the two most powerful words: faith and fear (pp. 45-57). He gives examples from his life and an insightful one involving George Eastman and a brownie. Norman Vincent Peale also offers his thoughts. Fascinating stuff.  Other tidbits I found very interesting included Joe's discussion of the importance of using "move-forward" words (p. 106) and the need to use short words, citing none other than Winston Churchill (p. 110).  In the end, you have to do whatever it takes to create and use that confidence and attitude that it takes to sell yourself. That's what matters. The tips and inspiration from this book will no doubt help a lot of people, and that's why I recommend this book. 
 I have been searching far and wide for the perfect laptop bag for my 15.4" Macbook Pro... and here it is. Unlike most flimsy bags (Targus, Im talking about you!) this one can stand on its own empty or full and doesn't give one the feeling that the laptop is holding the whole thing together. It has plenty of space and the compartments open all the way down to the floor while keeping your stuff in (with a detachable membrane on the sides). There is also this wonderful little compartment (a Wegner staple) that is just deep enough so that you dont have to go dig around for you things. Its also extremely comfortable to wear (even packed full of heavy gear) 
 This movie is hysterical.  I've seen is several times but just showed it to friends.  They laughed the entire time.  The casting is superb and they are all excellent.  Great story line.  Probably not what most would expect from the title 
 This one has it all, jazz, funk, pop, big band, a convergence of a perfect mixture of American popular music and a perfect American fantasy of the 1950's. Evokes memories of smoky Rat Pack parties, Cuban vacations, the red menace, and the vision of a streamlined future, even in those of us born decades to late have them first hand 
 Margaret Coel's latest installment in her Father John O'Malley mysteries will entice fans of mysteries and Indian lore. As in her previous entries, Coel involves Father O'Malley in the affairs of the Indian reservation with the perfect blend of Jesuit intensity, compassion and humanity. His understanding of the native community helps him to solve the latest mystery. A hint of an involvement with a colleague is intimated, and suggested as reason for him to leave his assignment. The recurring issues of alcoholism and spousal abuse offer social commentary and plot advancement without being didactic. Readers will not be disappointed at the book's ending 
 I enjoyed this book for the most part, in a couple of areas it was a little slow.  I enjoyed his adventures in getting into America, finding and working in New York.  Then having to move on to Chicago finding music, old friends and other villans.  There are some "flash backs" simularities between Henry Smart and his father from the previous book A Star Called Henry. There is another book in this Triology The Last Roundup which I plan to read as well 
 Deceptive as usual, King sets the hook with a story that starts off in "Normal" gear and races before you know it into "Spooky" and beyond into gruesome. The story is told in  retrospect by an aged attorney who, during his career at a New York law  firm, gets invited by a senior partner to join him at a private men's club.  Members are greeted and served by the ubiquitous semi-sinister butler-type  character. The club and its furnishings have some mysteries of their own  that are tantalizing but never fully revealed. The main activity at the  club is storytelling, which leads to King's central plot. Christmas time at  the club was reserved for a scary story, and a doctor recounts a poignant  and horrible tale from his past about a young woman patient "in  trouble" in the mid-1930's. Surprisingly, (along with the revulsion) I  was saddened by the intimate view of the way women were treated at that  time 
 This is my first experience with James Rollins but it won't be the last. Amazonia keeps moving from beginning to the end. I had a hard time putting it down. My usual reads are military, spy, government takeover, etc. novels so Amazonia was a great change. I'm getting tired of the same old and worn themes. If you haven't read Amazonia do yourself a favor. Try it, you'll like it 
 I'm not into Eastern philosophy to the point where I take visits to Buddhist temples and practice meditation on a daily basis. However, being a Westerner, I do believe Eastern philosophy is very interesting, intriguing, and very applicable to aspects of everyday life, especially in the life of us "hustle-n-bustle," constantly-on-the-go Westerners. A lot of Eastern philosophy just makes sense, as much as it is common sense.  To read one of the East's most cherished philosophical texts, I decided to go to the oft-translated Tao Te Ching. I spent about 2-3 weeks searching, comparing/contrasting, and perusing various translations of the Tao Te Ching (also known as the Lao Tzu after the author). I even downloaded some online free translations but they just didn't seem to catch the richness of this one.  Again, I'm no authority on Eastern philosophy nor do I take it as seriously as followers of its way(s) (no pun intended), so if you're like me and just would like to kick back and enjoy some mystical, esoteric, and common sense philosophy from ancient yesteryear, this is a very good translation in my opinion.  The only "downside," which really isn't a downside, is the author's introduction to the actual text. Hmmm... the author seems to me like an... overly skeptical academic, like a cynical college professor. Then he forces his opinions which are sprinkled throughout the introduction, such as his assertion that no Lao Tzu ever existed... possibly, but I would have appreciated a more nonpartial approach from the author: let your audience be the judges of an otherwise unsolvable topic.   Although the exegetical literary criticisms make for friction between passages in the intro at times, the text is good, which is what I really paid the money for: the text. And again, it's a good translation if you're not heavy into Eastern philosophy. Good purchase - I highly recommend it 
 My 8 year old son loves this fishing rod.  Received as Christmas gift and not able to actually test it out fishing yet, but appears to work well.  Seems like a safe and more fun way for a child to cast out for fishing 
 Money Ball was a great book. It shows that you don't need money to win in baseball(take that Yankees ;-P) Michael Lewis reavels that the team with the 2nd lowest payroll, the Oakland Athletics, can have so much dominance and success in a game where the best baseball players usually end up with the richest team. Lewis also tells the story of Billy Beane the GM of the Athletics. Billy's bad attitude and foul temper prevented him from making in the MLB. He exerts his attitude as a force over the so-called "experts" when a desicion must be made. Billy constanly goes against what the scouts think a drafts players that nobody has heard of. He shows that there are many aspects of the game that we don't know. All in all, this was an excellant book. My only complaint was that there was a lot of swearing.--- Jesse Hartman 
 Very detailed coverage of the constitution and amendments.  Each phrase is commented on and relevant and significant court cases and developments of interpretation are listed.  I highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in constitutional law and history 
 This is a terrific book on several levels.  First, just the love that these two women have for the people of Afghanastan and the picture they paint of life under the Taliban is interesting in and of itself.  In places it reads like a thriller, especially when they are arrested and their daring rescue.  Finally, just the incredible faith that these women exhibited under such trying circumstances is an inspiration to me.  Not that they are perfect, and they are the first to admit they struggled at times in those dark hours in prison, even bickering among themselves at times.  But in the end, their deep faith prevailed and a miracle occurred.   I felt like I was with them before, during and after their imprisonment, and that is a tribute to the great writing of this book.  And, by the way, much of the negatives reviews I've read here sound a lot more like anti-Christian bigotry then thoughtful criticisms.  Ignore them, and buy this inspirational, wonderful book 
 I really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc. I have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length. The movie is about a giant gorilla! It is a fantasy film kids! The original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well. I think the remake is incredible.....is it better than the original? In some ways yes! in some ways no! Thats the way it goes! I still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone's movie collection! I wish Peter Jackson would try to remake Son of Kong into as good a movie.....now if he can pull that off.......;-)  
 This book is at the same time immensely readable and yet quite profound.  Dr. Wilson does a superb job of taking medical information that to the layman might appear quite complex, and explaining it in very readable and understandable terms.  This is quite a gift!  She talks TO people, not DOWN to them.  I especially appreciated her candor in the chapter on "Regrets and Longings".  By allowing her readers to feel her own pain at being horribly and unjustly accused of a professional error in judgement, she validated the pain of everyone who might find themselves in a very difficult position that took them totally unaware.  This is a great gift she gives to her readers.  She comes across as human yet totally professional 
 I have been reading many different articles and books about Aspartame, but nothing really came close to this expose.  We cannot trust our government in any way, shape or form.  We are nothing but experimental animals to them.  Money is the bottom line always, and the body count doesn't matter.  The American Public should be very, very afraid after seeing this DVD!  
 The very best thing about Laura Robb's newest book is that after you read it, you don't feel you need to meet her. As I read, whenever I had a question,want to see an example, or wish that a checklist might be on the next page, there it was! After reading it you will have post-its on specific pages, feel organized and know that you have to have two copies, one for home and one for school. The book is perfectly organized. A short chapter on the research that shapes a middle school reading program, is followed by strategy lessons that go through the process of reading almost anything: before,during, and after reading. These chapters are prefaced by a most helpful chapter on what strategic reading looks like in middle school. The chapters after are on ways to connect students to books, cross grade projects and a wonderful chapter on assessment. The appendices are perfect! They hit the nail on the head from reading surveys to open ended discussion questions (by genre). This book is truly the answer to a middle school reading teachers prayers 
 I have served in two previous wars, Vietnam and Desert Storm and also on several other long tours of peace time duty. When I was recalled from retirement to go to Iraq I was already a 10% disabled veteran. I thought I knew, or at least thought I had a better then average laymans knowledge of the VA Compensation and Pension system. Little did I know, until I read Mr. Roche's book how little I really knew and what misconceptions I had. This book is a must for every armed forces veteran who has served in war or peace and has ever been injured or treated for an illness while on active duty. Mr. Roche writes in a clear and concise style and he presents the facts without being dry and technical. This book is a must purchase.  
 As a Yoga teacher I frequently review yoga books for ideas and new information. I am very excited about Easy Does It Yoga!  Could it be that finally Yoga has come of age?  This book might just persuade the Yoga  doubters to view Yoga as an acceptable exercise that truly will benefit the  mind, body and spirit in the present and on into aging.  The author, Alice  Christensen, has written a comprehensive and compassionate book on Yoga and  its tremendous health benefits for the older person, and indeed, anyone  physically challenged by bad health, addictions and inertia.  The various  disciplines of yoga are discussed and benefits illustrated by case  examples.  The exercises are well detailed in words and pictures.   Nutrition is covered in a reader friendly style that lists detailed menus  of wholesome foods.  Easy Does It Yoga should be required reading for any  business involved in the health care needs of today's older population 
 If you are a Gary Oldman fan, you MUST see this movie! This is one of his  finest performances, subtle and completely believable.   The story opens with Oldman as a cheating husband and corrupt cop, but twists and turns after that, incorporating subtle overtones of the paranormal and many ethical and moral dilemmas in a complex story of survival. Great stunt work, too. This one will grip you from beginning to end 
 This was an excellent book.  This is the book that got me hooked on Nicholas Sparks 
 You get rejected, you wonder why?  Could it be that the book proposal is not the best it could be?  To get an answer to that question I read Ms. Lyon's book, and saw that it was full of solutions to my problems.  I asked her to comment on my proposal.  I incorporated her comments/suggestions, and that new proposal got accepted and I got published.  I'll never know for sure, but without Ms. Lyon's book and advice, I might still be dreaming about getting published 
 fantastic grouping of Sammy's music. Great way to update old cassettes of Sammy's music to the CD versions. 
 This little book has become a classic amongst the adoption community. Choco goes in search of a mother, finally finding himself a character who can offer him everything he's been searching for and, although his new mother doesn't look like him, he finds happiness with her and his new "assorted" siblings. Warm and fuzzy and offers gentle opportunities to open the lines of communication about adoption. Highly recommended 
 I almost saw this movie in the theater when it first came out in 2002, but this was when I had to nearly go into the hospital in November.   I managed to buy the DVD awhile  ago and must say it is one of the few movies I am proud to say I own.  I know a lot of buzz when it comes to the whole J-Horror Movement but I will say the American counterpart of this film is great.    I want to see Ringu though for the full comparasion.   My room mate saw this and thought it was really brainy,  the supernatural elements are very slight until the end. I want to get the actual novel to see where the book compares to the film,  since they say this was a novel first.   The concept of the film is well excuted and for a horror film to take the number one slot on the Box office,  that is quite rare.  It hasn't really been done since JAWS,  so in that credit the movie does have a strong Alfred Hitchcock suspense aspect to it. As a horror writer,  I am very impressed with the atmosphere of the film for a PG-13 rated horror film this is one of the most impressive I've seen in a long time.    I can imagine this movie being seen at a brew and view, being it is nearly two hours in length it keeps you at the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Naomi Watts did a good job portraying concerned mother,  and if you want to watch movies that are similar in nature -- if you like this film check out Stir of Echoes by Richard Matheson.    The film version of that movie was nuts but hell it is was one of the creepiest films I've seen in a long time.  This film,  isn't exactly the scariest because it has a PG-13 rating but it is good with keeping the suspense level up there. I've been a student of the Hard-R horror as far as being an author, but watching this film taught me how to do the PG-13 style too 
 Legos, Duplos, Ello.. they don't hold a candle to the Kid Knex in the series. Unbelieveable how much our 6 year old daughter plays with these and our 3 YO son too. These have a good feel for kids too. Bright. Easy to use. We have all in set now. BRING ON SOME MORE 
 The sub-title of this book explains a lot about it. Most of us don't get to custom design our homes. But then again, most of us go looking at houses and after a while something clicks about a house and sooner or later it's ours. What do you do then?   The bare house is not a home. Sometimes it's a simple matter of highlighting by adding a rug under a window. Sometimes it means adding an archway or a new doorway to the outside or a railing around the porch. At any case, after buying the house you don't usually have a lot of money to spare for serious remodelling.   There are some houses in this book that are designed from scratch to fit particular needs, but even here there are numerous ideas you can use in your own home 
 For the money, this is a very good quality instrument. Good sound and reasonably intuitive functions and features 
 I was a typical "I'm not a wine person" person until a few friends introduced me to some tasty wines.  I then bought this book and it completely enhanced my appreciation of wine.  Wine for Dummies didn't make me a wine expert (I don't know that I'll ever be one), but it gave me a solid basis for at least knowing how to appreciate wines by terroir and varietal (and even just knowing what those words mean!) and furthering my excitement of this wonderful hobby.  I look forward to many more fabulous tastes and furthering my knowledge on the subject.  If you don't think you're a wine person, buy this book and at least give it a chance - it could change your perspective on food and give you a new appreciation of life forever 
      It is interesting how often we find ourselves in situations that we could never have imagined. It is not easy to start off whith a certain direction and mind and find yourself in completly different circumstance than you anticipated. the Wrens document this expierience with the skill that really shows how much they have felt the suprise inherient in aming one direction and going another.      Not so long ago the Wrens were an engergetic promising young band that were supposed to be the next big thing. To make a long story short, the Wrens failed to change their sound to meet this exspectation, their record company found a new band to replace them (a little known group called Creed) and the Wrens were history. Or not. Over the years the Wrens have released some very solid material at a very slow pace. Yet nothing they, or anyone else, have released in the last ten years compares to the Meadowlands. The record starts out with a slow, bummed-out song called The House That Guilt Built. "I'm nowhere near where I thought I'd be" sings Charles Bissell. A slow build continues with the excellent "Happy". A song that starts out with a lagging beat and seemingly random guitar figure. By the time the Wrens have been betrayed and gotten even the track has transformed into a beautifully textured rock out. Other highligts include "She Sends Kisses", "This Boy Is Exausted", and the spectacular "Hopeless". Great production abounds through out. All of the Wrens can sing and these harmonies really flesh out songs that are already packed with sonic texture. Key boards bang out melodies on top of mutiple guitar parts and help create an all consuming sound.      This is a wonderful piece of art because the Wrens have nailed an asthetic and emotional vision and made a consistantly great record. There are no poor parts and if you buy this record,  you will have no regrets 
 I've only viewed the final film of the Subspecies quartet, but my interest was peaked enough to pick up this related film. I'm glad I went ahead and bought it, as it is a fun romp. Jonathan Morris plays his role with just the right amount of camp, and the others are equally good, if a little over serious occasionally (with the exception of sofia, who's got a very cute smile). For fans of the final subspecies this is definitely a good buy, although its hard to tell whether its a prequel or a sequel. All in all a well shot, interesting vampire film. 
 Book arrived in excellent condition.  Shipped 2 days after I placed order and received in 3 days.  Excellent service 
 my dentist and dental hygienist recommended that i get this to prevent gum recession.  it is very easy to use, very reasonably priced and hnopefully will help my teeth and gums from getting too old 
 Gravy and Late Fragment are two of the most beautiful and powerful poems I know . . .  
 In an 8 month battle with the health effects of years on the standard Western diet, this book is now the first off my shelf of cookbooks.  (McDougall Quick and Easy is second).    The index is useful.  The food is filling and tasty.  The health effect is 65 pounds lost and cholesterol cut in half.  You will satisfy your desire for good food and possibally save your life 
 Like Emilio Estevez's "Rated X" (about the rise of the Mitchell Brothers and their soft-core pornography empire), this is a pretty good movie about a provocative topic made better by the DVD extras that elaborate on that topic.  In this case, director Paul Schrader skillfully tells the sad story of actor Bob Crane, a personable, upbeat guy eventually brought down by an excessive interest in the seamier aspects of sex.  I liked the way the opening parts of the movie were filmed in a bright, straight-forward manner as the earlier, optimistic period of Mr. Crane's career was chronicled, but then later the camera got all jittery and the lighting muted when, his demons taking firmer hold, Mr. Crane's career and life overall became likewise shaky and dark.  As good as the movie is, the generous extras on the DVD definitely make "Auto Focus" a must-see.  The centerpiece of the extras is an almost hour-long documentary (presented in two twenty-some minute segments) that covers every aspect of the real life case of the life and death of Bob Crane.  While the movie focuses on being entertaining and telling a good story, the documentary makes it clear what is known and not known about the case, letting the viewer decide for himself or herself what actually happened.  Together, movie and supplements, we get a thorough picture of the subject in question and the mysteries that remain.  One final word: While Paul Schrader is a great artist who always tries to tell a story in an intelligent, sensitive manner, it was nevertheless nice to see in the brief making-of piece also included here that he isn't above being a showman: "The early stuff with Hogan's Heroes and his white-bread home life was fun to film," he said, "but it wasn't the good Bob that people were paying to see, it was the bad Bob.  So we tried to get to the bad Bob stuff as fast as we could."  Somehow that was reassuring, seeing that an accomplished artist was still very concerned with giving viewers a memorable time and their money's worth 
 I just got this book on a friend's recommendation and thought that I would glance through it before going to sleep but I couldn't put it down.  I ended up reading the whole thing in one sitting and can't wait to go through it again.  It is so beautifully written and complex and moving.  It is not like a typical poety book in that it is structured more like essays but the essays blend together and fold into one another.  It is like poetry in that the choice of words and phrases makes the work very emotionally charged and, well, I know this is a corny word, but I would say profound. It really is a work of art 
 Again avantasia sends out a solid performance with probly their best song, seven angels.  OOO MY GOD! Seven angels is one of my favorite metal songs ever.  With great operatic vocals at the begging and a solid mix of speed guitars and power ballads.  Another great song is neverland, which deals out solid vocals, powerful lyrics, and great guitar riffs.  Don't get me wrong, the other songs are awsome as well and will be a terriffic addition to any collection.  Another must have cd from edguy's. signe 
 Okay, hair metal gets it's share of knocks and t'maters by metal snobs, but guys this is toe tapping stuff that still stirs Metaldiva's soul.  There are several of the favorite tracks over the bands' modestly long, admittedly choppy career. However, there are quite a few that were really good and funny like "She Goes Down" from "Dr. Feelgood" for example, that did not make the cut and others like the new "Bitter Pill" and "Enslaved" that never piqued my interest.  It's all there from their heyday and all the guys pitched in, if separately and apart from each other, with letters and messages to us and each other.  Motley Crue is living proof that if your band has an excellent drummer-Tommy Lee and talented bassist-Mick Mars and creative guitarist-Nikki Sixx, it doesn't matter what your singer sounds like, you can have a hit making band.  However, loving Vince Neil as I do, no one can argue that his former stage presence and his vocals were well matched with the music as a whole.  They are also an inspiration to their fans that have fallen into drugs and despair, by going through their separate recoveries and rebirths.  All of us watching are hopeful for positive progress with Mick's illness.  After all this time on the scene bands like this and their members feel like extended family and you just want to wish them the best.  After this last tour they all seemed to scatter and go on with other endeavors, but the new tour with Aerosmith ought to be a hoot.  They all sweat a little more and there's more of them to love, but they are still rockin'.  I have to wonder about more great music we may missed out on and never got written because of all the interpersonal issues and private tragedies that ultimately caused them to fall apart. We will never know, but this is the ultimate snapshot of a better days in which we all received the great gift of their artistic talents,if only for a brief time.  Metaldiva Sez: Great addition to any hair metal collection. It is short and left many great hits out, but is still great to listen to and remember when our hair was blown 4 inches higher than our heads. Great music from a great time in this genre..Get it home today..    
 "The Women Who Wrote the War" is a comprehensive compilation and listing of the contribution of women in the press in World War II.  From the first women to recognize the changes in Germany, the real threat of Hitler, and to sound the call of the rise of fanaticism, these women had to fight against fear, physical threats and censorship.  They also had to work their way around the bias against their sex....often entering dangerous areas with no support or credentials.  All arenas of the war were covered by women, from Germany, France and Britian, to the camps in the Far East and Russia.  These women were invaluable in providing an acounting of the horrors of war and the human toll it took.  They report on all fronts,and unflinchingly look at he horrors of war close up.  This book also details the struggle of these women to be accepted, to find their place in a male dominated career.  "The Women Who Wrote the War" is a fiting tribute to there trailblazers 
 After hearing bad opinions of Ayn Rand's philosophy I was not to optimistic about this book, but it was wonderful.  Its's easy to understand and makes sense in the worls today.  I suggest reading Atlas Shrugged after it 
     I read "Jackie's Wild Seattle". The Main charactors were Shannon and Neal.They, along with Shannon's little brother Cody, rescue animals around Seattle. They then take them to Jackie's headquarters, and she heals them. Shannon is a 14 year old girl and she is curious, adventurous, and myserious. She is also an exellent climber.     Shannon and Cody are ataying with their uncle Neal over the summer, and they help him rescue the animals. The resolution is very good, but I'm not giving away anything. I thought that the author's style was like it was being told by Shannon, the main charactor.The theme of the book was animals and drama.      While reading, I felt happy, sad, curioous, and shocked. I felt especially when I found out what Tyler, a kid working with Jackie for his horrible crime had done.I have never read a book like this before. I loved the suspence and drama in it.Anyone who likes animals, suspence, and drama should read this book 
 After reading this book and doing some of the suggested exercises, I became more sensitive to  negative space and related design  principles  and better able to apply them to my art.  
 Ode To The Master Trickster  Some say you have obscure South American roots. Some say you magically appeared in the 60's Weaving fact with uncanny human insight. Others say weaving only  Enchanting fanciful stories. Hats off to the master trickster.  Some say as a lad in Lima They called you little Arana. They say you were fascinated by  The mysticism of local lore. As a young teen you learned and practiced your craft. Learning to spin those wonderful tales, Hats off to the young master trickster.  Some say your mother passed away When you were a fine arts student. Still distant from your father, Some say you never recovered. Retreating deeper into those wonderful tales, Hats off to the master trickster.  In Brazil you were the witty fellow, The big liar living off cards, horses, and dice. A first class seducer at the local plaza, Honing your craft Practicing those wonderful tales Hats off to the master trickster.     Disappearing from sight for years With little news of your fate. Eventually resurfacing in LA With a new identity. Not just weaving, But now writing and publishing  Those wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.  The Doctors of Philosophy were impressed, The dissertation committee signed on early, Giving you their academic endorsement  And a blank check To publish your wonderful tales.  Hats off to the master trickster.  The shy and the timid, You gave them that sliver of hope, That their dreams and fantasies Might be fulfilled, As promised in your wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.  The impeccably dressed businessman, The erudite academic, And the old world shaman Shared power with the field hand, As proclaimed in your wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.      Daring to dream, Stretching that ever so small crack Between the worlds. Luminous beings going nowhere. Quite unlike your wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.   De Mille was on to you, Hammering relentlessly at your falsehoods. You answered and respun those beautifully In your next volume of wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.  Your devoted minions waited patiently For your directions. Reading your words, Practicing your rites. Often ending with ears ringing In deafening silence, As they tried in vain To make sense of your wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.  Moses, Mohammed, and Jesus, Did you deceive them as well? Or were they merely tools of your craft? For your wonderfully spun tales, Hats off to the master trickster.      Your brethren in the orthodoxy Knew you all along. They also have long histories Of rewriting and refining Their corrected versions of wonderful tales. Hats off to the master tricksters.  Being weak yourself, You knew our many frailties. Do we live with them? Overcome them? Or weave them into our wonderful tales? Hats off to the master trickster.  Living out your life in comfort. Reshaped by the corpus of your tales. Only to pass into the next realm, Where many may suppose You are still weaving those wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.    George Pennington E'town, Ky.        
 This is not true black and white film, it is color film with no color... but the results can still be quite nice if you ask the photo lab to print it on true black and white paper. You can have your prints back the back next day or even in 1 hour, depending on the lab. This is much nicer than the hassle of having true black and white sent away while you wait for a week 
 A book obviously written by a teacher. Ideas are clear for students to understand and assemble. One page directions with materials easy to find and prepare. Workable plans for huge displays that engage all students. Projects celebrate creativity at all abilities and provide students with art lessons that enhance seasonal themes.  Extremely useful for the classroom teacher with artistic limits, that wants to introduce students to a variety of art media 
 The powerful impact of this story sort of sneaks up on you in the cracks between the cartoon panels.  This story both of his parents troubles in Nazi occupied Poland, and ultimately as Holocaust survivors, is blended with the story of his strife with his aging father.  This is simple and powerful.  Story telling stripped to the bare bones 
 Ann Leary flew to London for what she thought would be a short vacation, when she unexpectedly delivered her baby prematurely. She uses humor and story telling skills to recount her subsequent five month stay in England, as her baby is born and then slowly grows. This book is a bit lighter than many books on prematurity, focusing on her fish out of water feelings as she copes with living on low funds in an unfamiliar environment. The author is frank and open about her struggles with the complications of having a preemie, in the special care unit and then in her apartment. This is a book that anyone can enjoy, as well as parents of preemies 
 This book's chapters are dense.  Of the three volumes of The Venture of Islam, however, it is the one that has held up the best under modern scholarship 
 Shirley Hazzard's memoir of Graham Greene on Capri came rather later than the main flood of memoirs and biographies that followed the death of the master. The author shares her memories of evenings and meals spent with Greene and her husband (the writer Francis Steegmuller, whose "Flaubert in Egypt" is one of the jewels of my book collection) on that exotic island, home to so many notable expatriates of yesteryear, Lenin and Norman Douglas among them. The book is interesting for its depiction of Greene in all his annoying lovability, although when you finish it (in little more than an hour) you might feel the need for more substantial fare. "Greene on Capri" probably won't be of interest to most people, but for diehard devotees of that difficult genius it makes for a worthwhile read 
 If you want an all-in-one comprehensive work at home reference this is the book to buy.  It contains useful information necessary for beginning and experience home workers.  Almost everything you must consider before starting or operating your own self-employment venture is included.  Covers topics such as marketing, finance, insurance, taxes, legal matters, motivation, organization, setting goals, time management, psychology, equipment and family considerations.  Includes checklists, worksheets, diagrams, money saving tips, resources and interviews of people who work at home for a living.  I thought this book was easy to read and understand.  I can see why Paul and Sarah Edwards are considered experts on the subject of working from home 
 Now this is one of if not the best greatest hits album ever made. Tom Petty is a very underrated artist and this album shows how great he was and is. From his first album untill today Tom Petty is one of the best rockers out there. Every song here is a classic and can be listened to over and over. Must have for anyone who likes music. Tom Petty rocks!! 
 I have the greatest respect for Martin Rees both as a leading scientist and as a scientist who believes in making science widely accessible. My sense is that in this book, he presents so much so briefly that the most important themes remain undeveloped.  The doom-and-gloom title only tells part of the story. Rees summarizes the many threats to our civilization, the biosphere, and even to the cosmos as a whole. These risks stem from natural events such as asteroids, comets, or super-massive volcanic eruptions, but even more from human activities. Rees does a good job of reminding us that science and technology are giving individuals, whatever their motivations, access to more and more power. It won't be long before a terrorist group or a Unibomber-type individual could cause enormous destruction, for example by unleashing homemade bioweapons. Other risks come from scientists heedlessly pushing the envelope of fields such as nanotechnology. The cumulative risk, Rees argures, has never been greater, not even during the depths of the cold war.  Still, Rees provides some hope. He advocates a renewed thrust into space, with the idea of establishing self-sufficient groups of humans (or our "descendants" in the form of intelligent machines) away from Earth, where even an Earth-destroying disaster would not bring human (and posthuman) history to a crashing stop.  These are important themes, which Rees backs up by brief references to those who have gone more deeply into them than he has.  I would have felt more satisfied by Our Final Hour if Rees had taken the time to go more deeply into his most important points himself.

 Years ago I was trying to keep warm at an MBTA bus stop where I read the opening lines of "The Dream of a Common Language" on a poster that advertised a reading and discussion by the author at Brandeis. I was moved to tears. I didn't get to Brandeis, but I bought and still cherish the book 
 This four-part documentary goes above and beyond in bringing us the true story of the life and times of William Shakespeare, the greatest writer who ever lived.  Each segment runs about an hour, but those four hours flew by in the blink of an eye for me because the story was so riveting.  The viewer gets to know Shakespeare as a person, not just as some writer who lived in a very distant land and time and wrote in a rather hard to understand language.  Not a lot has previously been known about his personal life, but thanks to this wonderful series, there are now a lot more facts out there.  It also really helps that Michael Wood, the narrator, is really enthusiastic about his subject, and has a very friendly and engaging demeanour, instead of being some boring overly academic suit.    Shakespeare did not exist in a vacuum; his life, and by extension his writing, were shaped by the outside forces around him.  The man lived through a lot of turbulent times, witnessing such events as the Armada, the Gunpowder Plot, and the beginnings of colonisation in the Americas.  Elizabethan England was also a major police state, and his family were often at the brunt of it, seeing as how they were originally Catholics.  In the era before separation of church and state, to be the "wrong" religion was inviting a lot of persecution.  He had also experienced firsthand a lot of highs and lows in his life; for a time his father held a lot of positions of prestige, honor, and respect, enabling him to go to a good private school, but at the age of fourteen, the family fortunes disappeared as quickly as they had sprung up, and he was forced to leave school, his literary awakening, and the promise of going to college and making something of his life.  It's really an amazing story how this young man was able to go from a nobody farmer's son to a highly renowned and respected playwright starting in the 1590s, to say nothing of going down in history as the greatest writer ever.  Though the series explores a lot of aspects of his life and times (such as the Globe Theatre, the earliest plays he acted in, the tragic death of his son Hamnet, his marriage, his Catholic roots, where he lived, his friends, and of course his wonderful plays), I was still left wanting more.  Shakespeare was such a fascinating person, who lived in such fascinating times, that just 4 hours is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to delving into his life and what he was all about!  Interspersed with this journey into who Shakespeare really was are scenes from the current players in England's Royal Shakespeare Company acting out some of his plays, such as 'Macbeth,' 'Hamlet,' 'A Midsummer Night's Dream,' 'Romeo and Juliet,' and 'The Tempest.'  In the end, the series shows how, though he wrote very much for his own time, in the end he was a man for all times.  A lot of the things he wrote about and dealt with seem so very modern, as though they could have been written in much more modern times but for the often hard-to-understand Elizabethan English.  Too many people make the mistake of seeing him as a balding middle-aged guy in an Elizabethan collar, not as someone who was once young and just starting out in his life and career, and as someone who's inaccessible to the modern era just because, to be honest, it can be rather hard to read and appreciate his works without seeing them on the stage or screen or at least studying them with a teacher.  There are also some deleted scenes which go into further detail on some of the subjects explored, such as Shakespeare's rival playwright Christopher Marlowe and his family's Catholic roots.  As awesome as this series was, however, I was a bit shocked to see numerous scenes of Mr. Wood and some of his assistants actually handling these original books, documents, and other artifacts with their bare hands.  There were maybe 5 scenes in which they actually wore gloves before touching these pages which are over 400 years old.  I was also rather offended at how he even speculated on whether or not Shakespeare really loved his wife Anne (though at least in the end he admitted that it was very possible he always loved her).  There was even some joking, when he was looking at the church record of their marriage, about how this 18 year old boy was being "forced" to marry this "long in the tooth" woman who was 8 years his senior.  While it's true that Anne Hathaway was pregnant when they married, there's no evidence other than conjecture that this was a shotgun marriage.  Is it really that unthinkable that an 18 year old boy could fall madly in love with a woman that much older, and truly want to marry her independent of the fact that he got her pregnant?  I seriously doubt that there would be this question of whether he actually loved his wife if he had been the 26 year old and she had been the 18 year old.  I say more power to him for picking an older woman to be his wife and going against the hypocritical convention in which it's normal and socially acceptable for the husband to be older, but suspect or strange when it's the wife who is older.  We also hear the beautiful early sonnet he wrote to her, with the concluding line declaring "And saved my life," which sounds like "Anne saved my life" when read aloud.  All in all, it's a great introduction to the Bard, for both devotees and people who aren't that familiar with his life, times, or works yet.  It's guaranteed to amaze those who never thought of him as so interesting, modern, lively, and accessible 
 "McCabe & Mrs. Miller" has long been considered one of the best films ever made and is considered Robert Altman's masterpiece (even though his only film to make The American Film Institute's Top 100 is M*A*S*H). The movie is one of the saddest movies you'll likely see. Although, keep in mind, I thought films like The Virgin Suicides and All the Real Girls were sad...So maybe I'm not the best judge of sadness. Anyway, Warren Beatty plays McCabe, a gambler, who arrives in the town of Presbyterian Church; A town that seems to always have a gray cloud hanging over it. This town embodies sadness. It's always dark, always gray, always raining or snowing. McCabe, in the beginning of the film, walks into a saloon, makes sure he knows where the back door is, walks back outside, comes in with a sheet, and covers a table. You hear people talking in the background about how they've heard about McCabe and how they heard that he shot a man...This seems like pointless candor, but it actually prepares us for an important scene much later in the movie. With his winnings from the gambling, McCabe buys three women so he can open up a brothel. His three women are pretty ugly, his brothel poor looking (although he plans to open a brothel and saloon). That's when he meets Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie), although why she's "Mrs." Miller is never quite clear. Mrs. Miller, a Cockney woman, quickly decides she wants to be McCabe's partner and the two see that it will work out best for both of them. McCabe is one of those characters that doesn't talk a lot and when he does, he's either talking to himself or muttering in low-tones. One of the most famous lines in the movie is something he says to himself "I got poetry in me." Whenever he talks to himself, it seems like he's saying things he wants to say to Mrs. Miller. The movie sets up the end of the film long before the ending rolls around. Some men arrives from a mining company and offer McCabe some money for his holdings. He names a price, they reject him, and later realizes he's made a mistake. He knows that the men will send someone to kill him. There's one (you probably can't even call it a) sub-plot involving a kid played by Keith Carradine, who rides into town and "visits" all the girls in the brothel. Before he's to leave, he begins walking across a suspension bridge to buy some socks but finds himself face-to-face with a young gunslinger. This scene is tense and you know the outcome right away, but it's still a very sad moment. This is a scene in the film I find simalar to the Mike Yanagita scene in Fargo. It seems pointless, but it kind of takes the film and puts it into focus. This a brilliant film, an example of what movies should be. It's not the most entertaining film, but it's beautifully photographed, has a haunting score (which isn't actually a score as much as a bunch of songs by Leonard Cohen), and a wonderfully depressing story. Highlighted by outstanding performances by Beatty and Christie, this is a masterpiece.  GRADE:  
 this book changed my perspective entirely & empowered me to know why i am so hard on myself & effectively make change.  knowing why & nonjudgmentally realizing that as small children, we interpret things so differently & incorporate those misinterpretations into who we are as people has been paramount in freeing myself of those self critical views.  the things this book discusses are THE reasons people suffer depression, anxiety, etc.  medication may help but the real solution is to DEAL with what's underneath the suffering when you are ready to do the work.  this book is huge & i'm forever grateful for what i've learned from reading it.  highly highly recommend to EVERY person because these things do effect every one in one way or another (to varying degrees of course).  if you are a parent or planning to be a parent, this information is highly useful as well.  
 Jane Brox's second book is masterful: a cross between social history and memoir, a book that is devastatingly clear about the future of the family farm and yet without a trace of rancor. Even if, like me, you're a city  person, you should READ THIS BOOK for its pervasive, gentle wisdom; for its  stunning prose; for everything a book should offer to its reader--access to  a beloved world 
 It being on the reading list aside, this author unwellknown in the United States, is well. I dont have time to write a review that does it justice, but this is what it feels like to be young.  Well, for me..I guess I had a bleak childhood 
 Two-fingered basslines, cosmic wooshes and thunderous Yamaha beats certainly don't make for quality music, but in the case of Alice Deejay's arrogantly-titled "Who Needs Guitars Anyway?", it makes for one heck of a party. Fuelled by the ubiquitous single "Better Off Alone"- arguably the most recognizeable mainstream electronica hit alongside Darude's "Sandstorm" and ATB's "9 PM (Til I Come)"- the album dives right into throbbing club stomps and trife lyrics. It's pure Velveeta, but the thing we Americans fail to realize about these bizarre Euro kids is their willingness to accept that cheese factor and just dance. Take it from that perspective, and you'll find a club record with surprisingly entertaining results. 
 Wow. Reading this book was like discovering the world isn't flat, after all.  If you love an alcoholic and have been afraid to change because you're afraid you'll lose the one you love, PLEASE read this book. Your life is waiting for you! 
 Eat Away Diabetes is extremely well researched and superbly written!  Taking complex subject matter, the author uses practical explanations and analogies, thereby making diabetes much easier to understand.   The information is current and extremely useful for people with Type 2 diabetes and those working to prevent this potentially devastating (but preventable) disease.  Numerous charts and sidebars are used throughout which serve as excellent references in my practice as a registered dietitian.   The author emphasizes the importance of exercise at length and explains  the roles of fiber, fat, carbohydrates, protein, vitamin/mineral supplementation, and herbs.  Ms. Napier also provides 28 days of menus and their accompanying recipes (which are healthy, creative, and tasty).  This book will remain a useful resource in my professional practice and daily life!  Thank you, Kristine Napier 
 Yummy! A very detailed book with tips and insight into the colorful cuisine of India. A must if travelling to India. We are not aware of the vastness of the cuisine in India. There is so much to taste and smell besides Curries. If you're a food junkie, it is a must 
 When I think back on the books that traumatized my childhood and made me prematurely pink-haired, nothing comes close to The Dark is Rising series, excepting maybe Lord of the Flies and Judy Blume's Blubber.  But, the latter books are really a bit over-the-top; sure, they'll introduce your child to evil, but then, who needs a book to know fly-ridden pig carcasses and adolescent girls are to be avoided?    No, every child should learn to recognize evil in all its guises: from  business-casual to Liberace body-suit.  And that's what Susan Cooper does -- her evil creeps up at you, like a small spot on the ceiling that you ignore until it's suddenly five feet long and the ceiling busts open.  Her evil even usurps the vocabulary of goodness.  That's why the kids in Susan Cooper's books really have to think -- and more importantly, they have to learn to trust their instincts and themselves -- that's where the bravery part comes in.  Evil (aka the Dark Side) only wins when the kids cop out and let an adult decide what to do.  Sure, it may seem like it'll make things easier at home, but how easy will it be when your home becomes a black pit of nothingness?  Usually I avoid anything to do with King Arthur or magical jewelry -- I can't stand hippies.  But, Susan Cooper has somehow de-hippified both concepts.  The Dark is Rising books are the only books from childhood I still regularly read.  To me, they really are masterpieces.  (And if I've let the Dark Side win in my own personal life, it's through no fault of Cooper.  Blame Blubber. 
 We enjoyed this film many years ago and it was just as exciting now as it was years ago.  Great acting 
 'Space Station 7th Grade' is a great, funny, and enertaining book. My son is in the seventh grade and reading this book was like reading a real life story of a kid new to middle school.   I really enjoyed the part of the book when Jason first had to take a shower after PE. Students having to run around in a huge shower room together naked as jay birds is many elementary kids 'worst nightmare'. My son's PE teacher has really good pointers, www bganssle com tsshowers html, for parents and kids who share this worry. Kids who feel awkward about their first showers at school, trust me and be like Jason in the book and give it a try. Soon any discomfort will pass.   Do you have a son or daughter about to start middle school? Have them read Space Station 7th Grade. My son had to learn many new things when starting middle school, the book was a like a guide book to prepare him 
 This book provided several "ah-hahs" for me.  I found thought provoking ideas that allowed me to better understand my deep grief for my father and my daughter. It is a "must read".  
 I bought this documentary because Whitwell, TN is close to Dalton, GA.  Some of my students had visted the museum on a field trip and I wanted to know more.  I had no idea what an impact this film would make.  It was very inspiring! I could not stop watching it and I had tears streaming down my face.  It was well-made and totally appropriate for any audience 
 This book is the best introduction to Arminianism available.  Picirilli is articulating what he calls "Reformation Arminianism," the actual views of Arminius himself.  His arguments are fair and compelling, and any Calvinist will admit that Picirilli has presented their position correctly.  The only thing I don't like about this book is the frequency of statements like "Due to lack of space in this volume, I have to restrict my explanation to this one point," and a few typographical errors (which can be expected with the first printing of anything) 
 Terrific writing and story line.  You wont be able to stop thinking about it all day long till you finish it!  Excellent twists through out the whole thing too.  The story just keeps getting deeper and more twisted.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of Tess' books.    Definately pick up this book! 
 To everyone who is in search of a song from the movie go to this link for a scene by scene song list:   http://imdb.com/title/tt0286499/board/nest/224815  I hope this helps 
 This is the best book on the topic of perinatal loss I have read. It is a guide through the grieving process not only for the bereaved parents but also for caretakers, friends and others. This book can help parents make decisions during a time when they may not be able to make decisions or when  they not know what their rights and options regarding their precious babies  are. It also validates the bereaved parents' feelings, since parents often  feel isolated during their grieving process over their child who died  before he/she ever lived on this earth. Other parents share their  experiences and you realize you are not alone. An exellent book that I will  recommend to everybody who has lost a baby or who knows somebody who has  lost a baby 
 This is without a doubt the DVD to own if you wanna see how 5.1 should sound and how digital video should look. If you own an HD TV and have a 5.1 system you must have this. The crowd has been minimalized. Whoever directed this did a fantastic job, you get to see a little of what every member is doing throughout a song. Incubus mixes up the set list a lil too putting some old favorites in there (Glass, sounds great). This is the best concert DVD out right no 
 If you liked the movie, you will LOVE the sound track.  I listen to it at work all day and the music takes you back to the wonderful sites in the movie.  Very inspiring and relaxing at the same time.  I have ALL the sound tracks to ALL the movies, this one has the longest of the Harry Potter Themes ... "Harry's Wonderous World"  Takes you right back into the movie.  Highly suggested for ANY Harry Potter fan, young or old 
 I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE BOOK WHEN I ORDERED IT.  MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE BOX IT CAME IN WAS CRUSHED IN TRANSIT AND THE BOOK, BOUND WITH A SPIRAL OF PLASTIC, CAME OFF THE PLASTIC SPIRAL AND I SPENT A DAY TRYING TO GET THE BOOK BACK ON THE SPIRAL.   L 
 As a "common reader" without special knowledge of the historical period covered by American Bloomsbury, I can't comment on its closeness to historical fact.     But, while I sympathize with the reviewer who said "_American Bloomsbury_ [is] rife with factual errors," I think it is intellectually lazy and even dishonest to simply tell us that a book is full of errors but not show us any.  (Did Susan pull your hair in school?)  There is certainly a place for fictionalized history.  After all, Gore Vidal made his reputation writing it and a generation ago some lesser lights such as James Michener made fortunes doing it.  Cheever says, about "Little Women", "[It], as many great books do, hovers in the gap between art and life--just alive enough so that we can recognize ourselves in its pages, just artistic enough so that we can find the lives we read about completely satisfying."  That is clearly where Cheever's book "hovers."  The last sentence of the book reads, "This book is taken from that imagined landscape, the landscape of a Concord where five people tangled with each other and the world and wrote the books that still inspire us.  It is my hope that this story will serve as a introduction to that landscape and that the reader will come to love it as I have."  Most people who have had the pleasure and opportunity to become experts in any area of history, don't like historical fiction about their special fields of study: it seems to them like a skein of badly woven prejudices and hopeless projections.  But Cheever didn't write for them.  For the rest of us, the intuitions of a lover of the literature and history of this period, and of the daughter of a famous American author, combined with an admirable literary style, are sufficient.    
 I am not an oil painter but now I want to be! Vicki's book Mastering Color is a masterpiece of its own. There are so many great explanations of the different kinds of color combinations, and all explained with such simplicity. It is such a joy to see the beautiful paintings displayed throughout.  Vicki is a true master of the medium, she describes the tools of the trade, her limited palette (boy was I happy to hear this!) and how to pack to paint en plain air. She really is an energetic, vibrant, teacher and has a passion for painting!!! Highly recommended for all who truly want to learn the basics about color theory by a truly skilled artist, top notch in her field. A++ 
 A nice summary of the study of philosophy from the time of Socrates (before Christ) to Sartre (20th century). It is written in clear, simple language, explaining philosophical concepts at a high level overview. I used this book to understand the history and context of Husserl's philosophy for a graduate paper. It is a handy reference for a philosophy course. 
 This book is great. Maya is a beast of a program and just following instructions in a book will guide and teach you but it takes actual practice and thinking on your own to really learn and understand. That is exactly what this book does. It explains what is going on and then it is left up to you to finish with its guidance. There is no better way to learn. Frustrating at times but so worth it in the end 
 Initial note of regret:  I only wish that they had included the first "Ultimate Spider-Man" annual in the Volume 14 trade paperback collection, because there is a wonderful counterpart to "Dumped" (issue #78) when Peter Parker hooks up with Kitty Pryde of the X-Men.  After all, if your complaint is that Spider-Man cannot have a girlfriend because she is going to get killed, then there is something to be said for a mutant who can phase through objects and let objects pass through her body.  We still love MJ, but if you think Kitty is cute by herself, then you have to see here on a date with Peter.  Unfortunately, that wonderful little story is being omitted from these reprints at this point, but surely at some point they will work it into a future volume (hint, hint, hint).  "Ultimate Spider-Man Volume 14: Warriors" lives up to its name by bringing together Moonknight, Iron Fist, Shang-Chi, and the Black Cat (and that is just the good guys).  The situation is that New York City's underworld is in shambles because with Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin, in hiding other players are moving in on his territory, most notably Allan Silvermane and Hammerhead (who is working with the Enforcers).  Of course, the Kingpin still has agents on the payroll, namely Elektra, who brings Spider-Man for a meeting with her boss.  Fisk wants Spider-Man to fight Hammerhead, and while our hero does not want to do anything to help the Kingpin, heroes are supposed to go after the villains.  Even worse, Jean De Wolfe thinks Spider-Man should go after Hammerhead too.  What is the world coming to?   Although we start off in #79 covering the same moment when Peter storms out of science class that we saw in #78, obviously this time we follow Peter instead of the dumped Mary Jane.  The pair do not even talk until #83, and it is not exactly a pleasant conversation, but then nothing has changed in terms of his reasoning for dumping her.  That does not mean that the Black Cat is getting anywhere with our young hero either.  Now, on the one hand it is fair to say there are too many super characters running around for a story that is not taking place in the "Ultimates," but Brian Michael Bendis (writer), Mark Bagley (penciler), and Scott Hanna (inker), manage to throw them into one room, start a giant fight, and have Spidey stop it to make a phone call for a second opinion.  Plus, from that point on there are a lot of bodies flying out of windows and landing on cars below (or darn close), so I have to round up on the slapstick, which includes a nice twist when the Black Cat finally gets Spider-Man's mask off and an ugly twist on the final full-page reveal.  Overall, the series seems to be in cruise control by this point.  The moral dilemma that Spider-Man faces with the Kingpin's offer is interesting, but not overly significant.  Peter's personal life are forced into the background for this storyline, giving Mary Jane and Aunt May little to do.  Peter has been skipping school, but Aunt May is out of the loop until the very end, so it might portend something, but what (will she learn of Peter's secret identity?) it is too early to say.  Spider-Man's problems with the opposite sex continue in the next volume, where he tangles with Silver Sable, which basically means we are going an entire year of the comic book without a story line being devoted to a major supervillain from the extant canon.  Still, "Ultimate Spider-Man" remains my favorite comic book, even when there is really nothing going on 
 Lion in the Valley ranks, in my mind, as one of the best in the early Amelia Peabody Emerson novels.  In this one, Amelia and Emerson finally get the chance to dig at the Black Pyramid in Dahshoor -- and you know how Amelia loves those pyramids.  This book brings backs the great characters of old and adds some very interesting new characters.  "Nemo" was an especially interesting character (at least until we find out about his situation) and Ramses is as precocious a troublemaker as ever.  This books ratchets up the tension between the Peabody Emerson and the Master Criminal, or M.C. for the sake of Emerson's bruised ego.  These stories are written with fun and excitement in mind, and if you can accept the tongue-in-cheek nature of the plots, then you'll able to sit back and enjoy a rollicking ride 
 Alternadad is a funny, at times touching, memoir of marriage and parenting.  Though Pollack is no Sedaris in the humor department (at no point in reading Alternadad did my sides split), credit where it's due: he does have an eye for quirky details, connections, and language.  Above all, Pollack emerges from the pages of this memoir as an eminently likeable person, and -- together with his wife -- a seemingly very decent parent: the kind of guy I'd like to hang out with.  Having just finished this slightly overlong memoir, I am left only to wonder what's so "Alterna" about this particular dad.  Pollack seems pretty much like the next guy, trying to earn a living, provide for his family, instill proper values in his child, etc.  (If that's alternative, I'd be curious to know what Pollack considers middle of the road.)  In the end, I enjoyed setting a spell with the Pollack family.   
 Wonderful.  McMillan gets inside the head of each member of the Price family by writing each in first person in successive chapters.  May have been difficult to write, but it makes for an exciting and intimate read.  The themes -- sibling relationships, spousal relationships, parent-child relationships, self-discovery -- easily transcend cultural boundaries because these themes are fundamental to all humans 
 First, should Mr. Davis ever read this, let me first extend my most sincere, heartfelt thanks for using your painful life experiences to help others.  Thank God you were able to find a way to not only help yourself but were willing to pass that knowledge along!!  Second, if you are a teacher who thinks this book and/or program couldn't "possibly" apply to your students because, "They're not mirroring their writing" or "They're not showing reversals like a dyslexic would" you REALLY need to open your mind and read this book to realize that the least common (yet, unfortunately, most known) symptom of dyslexia comes in the form of reversals.  If your phoenetic teaching doesn't seem to be working for extremely bright kids (or is working slowly but surely), PLEASE, for their sake, consider implementing this program!!  Finally, I swear that Mr. Davis wrote this book specifically for my 6 1/2 year old son.  My son's IQ was tested in the superior range.  He showed extremely early verbal capabilities and has frightened me with his intelligence many, many times.  He is one of the smartest people I have ever known, but he can barely read to save his life!  My step son, on the other hand, has Asperger's Syndrome - he has zero common sense, can barely carry a conversation, lacks independent thought, etc. - yet, he can pick up anything and sound it out to read it with about 85% accuracy (he just turned 6).  Having both boys in my home has underlined my son's reading problems.  He has an IEP and is is learning support for his reading and writing.  Yet his LS teacher *still* claims my son can't be dyslexic b/c he barely reverses his letters.  Ugh!  Show my son the word "Man" and he'll say "Guy" - show him the word "boy" and he'll say "Kid".  If that isn't a person thinking in pictures, I don't know what is!!  Anyway, we are going to participate with a Davis instructor this summer and I can hardly wait!  The assessment showed my son is clearly an excellent candidate and she actually had him spelling his middle name (Alexander) backwards and forwards within five minutes (he couldn't even spell it nor would he try before she had him do it in clay).  That showed me beyond any doubt that this program is the best thing to come along for our family and is definitely the answer to our problems when it comes to my extraordinarily bright child's inability to read.  Thanks again, Ronald Davis!!  God bless you!!  If you are a parent, grandparent, caregiver, child care worker - anyone who has the opportunity to help a bright child who is struggling with reading - please consider purchasing this book to see if the reason YOUR bright child can't read is because of dyslexia (regardless of what the school says!).  It certainly cannot hurt and might just be the key to open the door for them! 
 THIS GUY SURE KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT AND EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK.. THREE CHEERS TO THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU  STEPHEN FOR AN HONEST LOOK AT THIS TIME PERIO 
 You get several picture-ful phamplets included in the deluxe packaged cd!  It is priced at a budget affordable price.  It includes all of thier seminal early essential sides, and captures them at thier creative peak.  If you don't have any backwoods old timey vinatge 1930's mountian music, this is where to start.  This is the half of what influenced later bands like Bob Wills, Hank Penny, and Spade Cooley(of couse the other half of the influence would have been Jelly Roll Morton or Fats Waller).  Great cd 
 I never knew as much about Blaise Pascal until I had read this book.  What I'm really interested in is getting to know all of those lovely sources that McPherson used for her research material.  Before I had read this book, I didn't know much about Pascal's scientific experiments or his contributions to French society.  This book has also cleared up a lot of the background concerning Pascal's writings.  It is well written and highly entertaining.  
 Great for beginners, intermediates & up. Created in 1969, it's *still* a bestseller today. This is an *amazing* work in detail & scope. If you thought Drawing the Head and Figure was packed with information, wait till you see this slim, detailed book(!).  Entirely black & white- mostly pencil, sometimes ink- It begins with a general comparison between popular animals & types (pages 1-19)- which really makes this book shine for those who don't draw animals often. This section includes a few skeleton structures, as well as comparative standard basic shapes & actions. These 1st 19 pages may be the BEST in the book. Hamm then proceeds to detail specific animal types. He gives us the simple basic shapes for all popular species, as well as a wealth of construction hints, tips, and tricks for those involved with drawing from memory. Yet- this book is *only* about mammals: No insects, birds or reptiles here...  As expected, popular animals get more attention then others.

 This really helped me with my class.  I don't know what I would have done without it 
 This book is absolutely hilarious and witty! I love the main character, Molly Brown. Even though it's classified as a gay and lesbian book it doesn't focus on that, which is what I most admire about this book. It focuses more, to me, on Molly's ability and strength to do what she has to do, regardless of her financial situation and what other people think. This book is a story about having the strength, will, and courage; to do what you wish and be who you want to be, all of which Molly has little bproblem obtaining and keeping 
 This story is based on a real life happening over several years. The DVD extra The Entity Files goes into the true story in great detail and, is fasinating in its own right. Barbara Hershey is superb in the role of the tortured woman and, not bad to look at either. Be warned there is graphic nudity although I believe some of it to be a rubber molded body. None the less its a thoroughly enjoyable story and not a cheesy slasher horror film! Ron silver is his usual boring self.Thank goodness hes not in it that much 
 Most people know Warren G for his track with Nate Dogg, "Regulate".  But the fact is this album is completely packed with westcoast classics!!  The name of the album describes the production well...totally fulla that G-Funk.  Any Hip-Hop fan can appreciate "Regulate the G-Funk Era", check it out 
 I've seen Stephen Lynch live, in this Comedy Central special, and heard his audio cds.  Live is by far the best experience but this video is a close second.  The live audience really enhances the experience.  This is some truly funny stuff 
 This is one of the few books that has really changed my life, or at least my viewpoint on life. To start with ignore some of the earlier reviews with claims of how "snobish" it is. That is a persons reading who doesn't understand how someone can present a viewpoint that is not necessarily their own.   You see, Fussell presents how the different classes in this country view themselves and the classes they aspire to join, fear falling into, or just plain despise. In doing this it may sound very condesceding but in fact is just a documentation of a viewpoint.  Although I really, really, really wish the author would do an updated version of this book along with some new trends in class such as beer snobs and the like you really can fill in the blanks yourself. Not much has changed in the past 20 years. Just some small details.   If you don't believe in class you soon will. If you believe in class you will soon see how rigid our system really is. And no matter what you WILL see yourself in this book. It is impossible not too!!  
 an absolutely brilliant novel, concise and intense and thought-provoking while allowing for occasion bits of wry humor and, towards the murky conclusion, outright hysterics.  plomer tells the story of w.p. telling the story of a dying turbott wolfe telling the story of a young turbott wolfe as he interacts with native south africans.  the superficial theme of race relations my have gotten this book reprinted and heralded by nadine gordimer, but its real worth is in the character of wolfe, a bizarre combination of gatsby and prufrock (and a possible genius), ultimately failing in a great attempt of re-creation.  pay special attention to plomer's cat-thought descriptions; they're fleeting but brilliant 
 I stumbled upon Wires on Virgin Radio UK recently and absolutely fell in love with the lyrical content as well as the voice of the lead singer. I've never heard of Athlete before but will know them present and future as this is one album that is most unreal. I bought the album with no thought except of Wires and have been completely satisfied with each song on the record.  I'd compare Athlete to the likes of Coldplay and U2, music that is everlasting. Definately one of my favourite albums in my very long list of music that I have. Highly rated 
 While the average movie watcher may not recognize the name Betsy Russell (Private School, Cheerleader Camp), those of us males who grew up in the 1980s, weaned on hours of dedicated cable viewing, know her as something akin to a goddess in the world of dumb, teen comedies for basically two reasons...she was one fine babe, and she didn't seem to mind showing some skinage, as evident in the film Tomboy (1985), among others.  Originally released by Crown International Pictures, the film was directed by Herb Freed (Graduation Day, Survival Game) and stars, as I mentioned, Ms. Russell.  Also appearing is Gerard Christopher ("Superboy"), Kristi Somers (Hardbodies), Richard Erdman (The Blue Gardenia), and the late Eric Douglas (The Flamingo Kid), youngest son of actor Kirk Douglas.  Russell plays Tomasina `Tommy' Boyd, a tomboy through and through who spends her days working on cars, shooting hoops with the boys, and riding her motorcycle.  After a fairly schmaltzy and pointless opening sequence showing Tommy as a girl, playing baseball with the boys, scoring a run, and ultimately hugging her father (who was apparently an astronaut in the air force), all done in slow motion montage form, we're now in the present as Tommy rises from bed and proceeds to shower...some skin but no goodies...yet...man, you wouldn't think you could be jealous of a sponge...anyway, Tommy works as a mechanic at Chester's Garage, a dumpy filling station where she's often visited by her girly girl friend Seville (Somers), an aspiring Broadway dancer who seems to have little problem sleazing her way up the ladder of success, as evident later on in the film.  After witnessing a dance audition by Seville and her troupe, one performed for some potential financial backers (surprisingly enough they declined on investing in Seville and her rotten routine), we're back in the garage as big time stock car driver/professional pretty boy Randy Starr (Christopher), who Tommy's got a serious crush on...seems Randy has been hired by a local rich and infinitely sleazy dink named Ernie Leeds, Jr. to race for him, and Randy offers Tommy an invitation to come to Leeds' house to check out his boss stock car.  After this we see Seville auditioning for a donut commercial, whoring it up good, followed by Tommy and Seville heading to Leeds' house where Tommy and Randy race around on motocross bikes (at one point Tommy crashes in a swampy morass, resulting in her revealing her Tommy `guns, if only to get out of her wet clothes...hootchie mama!).  Following this there's a party sequence at Leeds' house (with parachute pants as far as the eye can see), Tommy and Randy hook up, as evident with an overly long montage sequence featuring the pair engaging in all sorts of outdoor activities, but eventually they have a falling out as Tommy shows Randy up on the race track while an important sponsor is in attendance, the result being the pair deciding to race each other to settle once and for all who the best driver is...  While the Tomboy is pure 1980s teenage hokum through and through, it fairs better than its counterparts based solely on the presence of Betsy Russell and her generous `assets', along with her willingness to put them on display.  The movie itself actually played like one, long series of Mentos commercials.  One example of this is early on as Tommy is riding her motorcycle to work and she stops off to engage in a game of basketball with some local chumps.  Through a bit of creative editing Russell makes all of her shots, but then here's the kicker...as she's leaving, she climbs aboard her motorcycle and one of the dudes tosses her the ball.  She catches it with one hand, puts it up, and swoosh!  It goes in...as she drives off the yahoos begin high fivin' each other, apparently overjoyed in the fact they've just been emasculated by losing to a girl in their own sport.  I did learn a lot of things from this film, including the following...  1.	I'd give my left gonasticle to be Betsy Russell's loofa. 2.	Pretentious, forgettable pop songs from the 1980s, often featured in films like this, generally included meaningless lyrics like `You got the magic, I got the fire'. 3.	Nothing gets women hotter than chasing them around town in your muscle car, throwing a constant barrage of catcalls in their direction. 4.	When a sign warns of `severe tire damage', they ain't kidding. 5.	Untalented bimbos could manage to find success given their willingness to whore it up. 6.	Someone other than Jimmy `J.J.' Walker actually used the phrase `Dy-no-mite!' in the 1980s. 7.	When doing a television commercial for donuts the performers actually get paid in donuts. 8.	Goofy, slow motion montages are a great way to pad out a film. 9.	When waiting for a woman to meet you for a date it's probably not a good idea to let her walk in on you while you're watching porn as she'll think you're some kind of skeevy perv. 10.	Apparently, in the world of stock car racing, slapping a jet engine onto your vehicle isn't considered an illegal modification.  The performances were passable for a movie like this (although the idea of Betsy Russell as a tomboy seemed a bit farfetched), but the writing is pretty lousy (this one's about as predictable as they come).  I seriously doubt anyone was sitting on the edge of their seat at the end of this one, wondering if plucky Tommy would beat arrogant Randy in the race, thus validating Tommy's belief a woman can do anything as well as a man.  I do love these kinds of films, though, as they take on the superficial mask of female empowerment while passing along copious amounts of nekkid female flesh (Russell's character was the only female that came off remotely decent here).  I did gag a little on some of the schmaltz-laden montages but overall, I'd say this was an entertaining, three star (out of five) feature, and an extra star thrown in for Ms. Russell.    The picture quality on this BCI DVD release, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), looks pretty decent, and the Dolby Digital stereo audio comes through well enough.  There aren't any extras, except for a few trailers for some other BCI DVD releases in their Crown International Classics (I wouldn't necessarily refer to some many of them as `classics') series including Hunk (1987), The Beach Girls (1982), Jocks (1987), and My Chauffer (1986).

 Isaac Asimov was one of the most prolific writers not just in science fiction, but in all of literature. Having written upwards of 500 books (distributed throughout every category of the Dewey Decimal System), compliling the definitive Asimov omnibus, clearly, is a monumental task. This, the first in a three volume series (I have never come across the two subsequent volumes), collects a good portion of Asimov's short fiction (though, indeed, not as many as the title implies) - including some of his earliest work, and some of his best. This collection includes about 50 stories, comprising the previous short story collections Earth Is Room Enough, Nine Tomorrows, and Nightfall and Other Stories in their entirety. Included in it are some of the classic science fiction short stories of all-time: Nightfall, The Last Question (one of my absolute personal favorites, as well as Asimov's own favorite of his writings), and The Dying Night; as well as personal and sentimental favorites such as The Ugly Little Boy, Jokester, Dreaming Is A Private Thing, Profession, and Breeds There A Man...? It also includes such widely anthologized pieces as It's Such A Beautiful Day, The Fun They Had, and The Machine That Won The War. The collection also picks up several lighter pieces - such as examples of Asimov's poetry, which show that, despite his often leaning toward the cerebral in his stories, the good Doctor was also one big goof. Though by no means a complete overview of Asimov's short fiction, this is a very good place to start if you are new to the author - or if you want to get a good portion of his works in one convenient place. One need not go into the individual merits of these stories: Asimov's reputation precedes itself. This is some of the greatest science fiction ever written, essential to any fan of the genre, or of imaginative writing in general. Very highly recommended 
 This book has kept me entertained to the very end, I loved it. I love Fantasy, like Terry Brooks, T.A. barron, and Harry Potter. If you are intrested in any of these types of books then you will love this.  It draws you in, and you can't get out.  It really makes you feel like you are in that situation.  A must read 
 When the Clash broke up following the release of "Combat Rock," Mick Jones formed Big Audio Dynamite (B.A.D.).  The band built upon the more adventurous aspects of the Clash, such as 1980's "Sandinista."  As it says on the back cover of this CD - Rock-Reggae-House-Hip-Hip...B.A.D.  The group really combined a dizzying array of musical styles, and at their best, they pulled it off beautifully.  The group never received as much attention as they deserved, which is a shame considering the success that other groups have had in the 1990s and 2000s by combining genres in a similar manner, such as the rock-rap of Limp Bizkit.  "Super Hits" gathers 10 of their best known songs.  The CD starts off with two of their most hip-hip flavored songs - "The Bottom Line" and "C'mon Every Beatbox."  These songs are a bit sample-crazy but work surprisingly well.  After releasing a few records, BAD broke up in the late 80s, only to reunite as Big Audio Dynamite II in the early 90s and release their two biggest hits - "Rush" and "The Globe."  "Rush" has an extremely memorable and catchy chorus - "Situation no win/ Rush for a change of atmosphere," and it even managed to become a Top 40 hit, peaking at #32 in 1991.  "The Globe" is equally memorable, although some people may scoff at the sampling of the Clash's "Should I Stay or Should I Go?"    I'm puzzled by the other reviewer's comment that his version contained a different song in place of E=MC2.  My CD contains the right song, and it's brilliant - full of incongruous samples that blend masterfully.  I also really love "Medicine Show" which samples liberally from the Clint Eastwood film, "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly."  The group was sampling before it became popular outside of rap and before the technology caught up with the group's ambition.  I wonder what they would be able to accomplish today with their music?    B.A.D. recorded some really great music.  The only reason that I didn't give this CD 5-stars is because an even more complete collection is available; "Big Audio Dynamite - Planet BAD: Greatest Hits" contains all 10 songs from "Super Hits" as well as 5 additional selections at a similiar price.  Although I don't have that CD and therefore cannot attest to its sound quality, I suggest that you check it out before making a purchase. 
 it goes everywhere with me.  it's one of those little guides that i can't imagine living without.  i use it every day. it lives in my purse.  
 Ok, I am just writing this review to balance out all the idiots who gave it really low ratings, claiming it sucked, Wumpscut is washed up, or whatever.  Ok, this is no Embryodead or Dried Blood, but this is still a good CD in its own way.  Aside from the "Maiden" tracks, (I have to skip those sorry), there are some good ones on here.  The title track, "Evoke", along with "Perdition" are both good cuts.  If you are a Wumpscut fan, you will like this cd.  you might have to skip 1 or 2 tracks, that's it.  Don't listen to people saying this cd sucks, or that "Wumpscut is over", Rudy will never really be over, sure his sound changed, but music is SUPPOSED to evolve people.  Here in the darkness, evoke, evoke 
 very easy to read and keep up with details.  very descriptive.  Hecto 
 It is interesting that both William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens began their writing careers with a comedy. Charles Dickens is best known for his harsh portrayals of Victorian England (especially in "A Christmas Carol"). But this 1st book shows that he can draw hilarious comedy as well. We meet the  Pickwick Club. (Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Snodgrass, Mr. Tupman, and Mr. Winkle.) They are a bumbling group, but they are benevolent. Undoubtedly, Mr. Pickwick was based on Charles Dickens's father. The great Charles Dickens's father was a warm hearted and caring man, but he was also unlucky. He did in fact spend time in the debtors's prison. Well, moving on, the Pickwick club meets the comical villain Mr. Jingle. Mr. Jingle gets the Pickwick club into various sorts of trouble. He stops a would be wedding between Mr. Tupman and Rachael Wardle. (Jingle himself wants Rachael's fortune.) Well, Jingle shows himself to be good at double talk and alienates the 2. While his plot fails, he tricks Pickwick into appearing in a girls' school after hours. You'll probably notice that this book (like "Moby Dick") is full of digressions. We hear unrelated tales from different characters. (To some, this is a welcome technique while others find it annoying. Though the tale of Gabriel Grub does foreshadow the phenomenal "Christmas Carol.") Moving on, in a well worded passage Mr. Pickwick leads his landlady Widow Bardell into thinking he wants to marry her, when in fact he was just considering hiring a man servant. And of course Mr. Pickwick goes on trial for not keeping a promise of marriage. (Charles Dickens himself actually did many live readings of this chapter.) While we know Mr. Pickwick was is not guilty, he ends up being charged 750 pounds which he refuses to pay. And of course, he (like Charles Dickens's father goes to prison). While he can afford the money, he refuses to pay because he is innocent. The scenes of the prison break the comedy. Even Widow Bardell is thrown in prison by Dodson and Fogg. But all is not lost. Pickwick's servant Weller comes to his aid. And Mr. Pickwick realizes that he must leave prison to help Mr. Winkle. (Mr. Winkle has married Arabella, and her brother is not so happy about it.) Mr. Pickwick pays what he must to exit the prison and he of course comes to the aid of his friend Mr. Winkle. The story ends in utter happiness. Mr. Pickwick even forgives Mr. Jingle. Perhaps the greatest thing about this book is that it is NOT ONLY hilarious comedy, but it shows how true friends stick by one another, and it even takes it to the next level by showing the wonders of fogiveness. This book drove England Pickwick mad when it came out. (There were Pickwick coats, hats, cigars, candy, and canes.) Need we ask why 
 This poignant, exciting, realistic tale of human iniquity and eventual spiritual resurrection evokes, and is mostly equal to, "Once Upon A Time in America". Olmos' directing and acting are both brilliant; in a genre where there's a strong temptation for the actors to ham it up with gang signs and baggy pants, he has inspired real sincerity and genuine emotion. Never for a moment do any of the protagonists seem like they are trying to act cool; it's entirely convincing. The voiceovers - You Ride, Behind Pride, Thinking you can hide; the music - the killing of one of Santana's own accompanied by the desperate "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"; the wealth of expression on the actors' faces - as when Santana learns his mother has died; all add up to create an extraordinary atmosphere. Colors, light, shadows are all beautifully arranged; an especially effective scene being when La Eme and Nuestra Familia file into the prison's cinema, their light and dark blue shirts the only colors. Superb performances by JD, Mundo, Puppet, Little Puppet, Cary; sorry, I don't know all their real names, but they are to be congratulated. Make sure you wait for the closing credits to hear "Ain't No Sunshine". 
 any book that makes one think is good, and this book does. aquarian gospel, impersonal life are other examples. from my two near death experiences i can relate to most of what is written. However i didn't find dogs in heaven, but then one finds what one is looking for, in my case my teachers 
 This is definitely one of those novels that is like a car accident-- it's ugly, but you can't look away.  Rossner's hypnotic writing style and pitch-perfect characterization will hook you from page one.  What is perhaps most haunting about this work, however, is not being ushered into this dark, lonely way of life that Theresa Dunn leads but rather finding out just how many similarities you share with her.  This book will definitely stay with you, which isn't the best feeling, frankly, but trust me, if you don't read it, you're missing out on a superb literary experience 
 Decades from now, this book will be seen as a seminal work -- a book that opened up spacious new frontiers to musical exploration and dramatically changed the sound of the world's popular music.  All previous analyses of music started and ended with the "harmonic series" -- the pattern of partials that is produced by virating strings, for example.  The musical scale, tuning, and instruments of Western music have all evolved to maximize their "fit" with this pattern of partials.  But electronic music synthesis frees musicians from the restrictions of the harmonic series.  This begs the question: can emotionally-satisfying music be made with inharmonic timbres?  If so, how?  What, exactly, is the relationship between tuning, timbre, spectrum, and scale?  By clarifying this relationship, Sethares lays the foundation for a "Grand Unified Theory" of music.  That Grand Unified Theory has not yet been created -- which means that YOU can help design it; YOU can write its seminal works; YOU can perform music that's like nothing ever heard before, and yet which resonates as emotionally as the very best works of the Common Practice Era.  YOU can be the Beethoven of the 21st century -- but first, you have to BUY THIS BOOK.  :- 
 The extended scenes in the new cut really add to the film experience.  The featurettes and behind the scenes specials are incredible.  The best part of the set is the brand new documentary on the life of C.S. Lewis.  It is very informative and so well done.  Well worth taking a look at 
 I purchased this book when my husband was diagnosed with ADD.  I had very little experience with the condition and didn't know how to help him.  The book was wonderful.  It includes so many helpful tips for non-medical management that I was almost overwhelmed with ideas.  We slowly tried them out and kept the ones that worked for us and discarded those that didn't.  The book also helped me understand the condition.  I had a hard time understanding what his world was like but the book really helped with that.  It is a must read for any parent or spouse living with an ADD sufferer 
 Colette's beginning as a writer is one of the strangest in literature.  In her early 20s, she married a no-talent hack named "Willy" (that was how he signed his pieces) and wrote a series of novels about a young girl named Claudine.  Willy took these pieces and published them under his pen name, giving his young wife no credit.  In her early to mid 30s, Colette grew weary of Willy, and turned her back on him to embark on a career as a dance hall performer.  This is the setting for THE VAGABOND, Colette's first post-Willy novel, and the first to bear her own name.  The main character, Renee Nere, has been touring for 3 years, and although she's sometimes lonely, is enjoying her freedom and self-sufficiency.  She's also suffering from what we'd refer to nowadays as Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.  Her marriage to her philandering and abusive husband was so wretched, that when she meets another man who loves her, the slighest familiar gesture or word will trigger memories that incite revulsion.  THE VAGABOND is a gem of a novel that beautifully shows off Colette's gift for prose as well as her wonderful descriptions of life backstage as part of a touring group.  If that isn't enough, she is also very gifted at revealing the psychological insights of her character.  The introduction by Judith Thurman is well-done, and both the introduction and the novel left me wanting more Colette 
 This book is an absolute triumph. First, it is positively gorgeous - the images just leap off the pages.  Second, the essays are more in-depth, engaging, and informative than any other book I've found on the subject.  This book discusses every facet of Art Deco as well: it explores the origins at the Paris Exhibition in 1925, goes through the influence in East Asia, Latin America, and South Africa, not to mention Europe. A great chapter on Deco in Hollywood; also explores all of the sources, iconography - and all of this on top of covering every aspect of the movement - ceramics, jewelry, fashion, architecture, glass, photography, graphic design, bookbindings, travel and transport, and so so much more - with stunning visuals.  A fantastic read, a great resource, a beautiful work, and an absolute MUST for anyone interested in the subject! Well worth the money, and a fantastic addition to any library.  Highly recommended 
 The book Kull is a collection of short stories by Howard. I haven't read any of his other works, but I imagine them to be as good or better than Kull. Kull is an exiled Atlantian who goes through several stags in his his life before becoming King. The stages of Kull's life were laid out in a paragraph, which left much to be desired, but the rest of the book makes up for it. The stories tell of Kull as king and all the hardships he goes through. Most of the stories are great, but they take a few pages to become interesting also some of them are quite predictable 
 This shoe is true to fit in every way.  It's very comfortable and secure feeling.  I can wear the shoes all day and never feel any discomfort.  I bought them in black and they look really nice with any slacks 
 I urge everyone out there to download this episode!  This one totally rocks! Shep, a Wraith and Kolya all in one episode!  Any episode with Shep (Joe Flannigan) and Kolya are well worth watching!  Download this and download every other Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis episode!  
 I have always felt that the best novels are not the ones that you consume like candy, devouring page by page, but the ones that consume you - quietly, slowly, unexpectedly, filling you up a day at a time.  I finished The Echo Maker over a week ago, and I still feel like I am living with the characters, who are so real, so flawed, and so alive that you find yourself despising and forgiving every one.    Don't be scared away by Powers' reputation for tackling heady, difficult subjects - I didn't always understand the science here, but it didn't impede my reading experience at all.  You'll walk away from this enlightened, more curious about the workings of the human brain, and you'll be rewarded with a fantastic story.  This is a rich novel - not flawless by any means, but tragic, hopeful, and humane, and well deserving of the National Book Award.  This is the first Powers novel I've read, I can't wait to go back and read more.  
 As I am buying my son his first microscope at age 11, I purchased 5 books to help this investment have the documentation to use it to its fullest. I find this book very good, but a little advanced for my son at this time. While it explains many tools to use with the microscope, it does not show how to make them yourself. I very much like the links it provides for future referance as my son's knowledge and experience progresses. In my son's case, it will take much parental help with this book to fully understand and gain from this book 
 This disc showcases some of Laurel and Hardy's funniest and best silent shorts, and I also found there was more variety in the backing music than in some of the other discs in this series.  'From Soup to Nuts' is hands-down the best and funniest one on here, their funniest silent short I've seen so far.  Part of what makes their sound shorts so funny is the fact that their voices just totally matched their personalities and physical appearance, adding to already funny situations, but in 'From Soup to Nuts' the gags and situations are so hilarious they don't even need speech to add to the hilarity.  'Two Tars' and 'The Second Hundred Years' are also hilarious and classic, very strong material.  The fourth L&H short on here, 'Slipping Wives,' features them together but not really a proper team, though they have more interaction here than in some of their other shorts where they appeared together before being officially teamed.  That one is also very strong and funny.  Of the two Stan solo shorts featured, 'Under Two Jags' (which admittedly might be a mislabeling of a different film, 'Scorching Sands') is the stronger and funnier, despite the fact that there's not a single intertitle besides the introductory one.  In my opinion the weakest one is Stan's final solo short, 'Should Tall Men Marry?'  It's well-written and well-acted enough, but just not as interesting, funny, or solid as the other five 
 Product is exactly what you would expect.  I have been using it for 2 months 3-5 times a day with great success.  I would buy it again knowing how well it works 
 Eric Carle is so creative, and my kids are very interested in his work. This book wonderfully captures the way several different sea creatures carry the eggs of their children before they're born, and all of the carriers are male. It's totally original and manages to be sweet too, so it definatley appeals to the young reader 
 Charlotte Kasl is a no-nonsense writer who expresses herself with wisdom, honesty and guts. Although I did not like to hear part of what I read in Many Roads...I knew what Kasl shared was, and is, true. I am committed to allowing myself to be comfortable with my own inner power and to manifest my full capacity. Kasl's book (like Women, Sex and Addiction) is most helpful in assisting me in my growth and in releasinge co-dependent patterns I learned as a child. Many men (particularly those afraid of powerful women) might find this book very threatening, but, so be it. For women willing to heal and grow, and honest, sensitive men, it's exceptional... 
 This Works!!!!I was looking for a workout that I would feel and that would stretch me as well. I do  Aikido and really feel a need for more flexibility. I was inspired by the Iraqui guys review below so I got this and -WOW  -I'm pretty fit, but this is a workout that I feel for a few days after! For me, it really works!  They start off the workout with spinal stretches and then continues on through series of standing poses. I felt myself focusing on my legs, core, and back. By the end I feel a definite increase in my range of motion and flexibility. Exactly what I was hoping for. Great stretching, great pacing, great DVD. I was inspired to buy more of Ana Brett & Ravi Singh offerings! I just received 3 of their other DVD's and can't wait to sample them 
 I am presently building a machinist's toolchest, which I designed myself, using ideas from Jim Tolpin's "The Toolbox Book" and a bunch of pictures and data from the internet. I'm happy with the results so far and confident of completing my first effort. However, if I'd had Jim Stack's book, I might have started my project a lot sooner. "Building the Perfect Toolchest" is a book of projects--15 of them--that covers almost the same RANGE as Tolpin's, but obviously not in such glorious and varied detail.   The first project is a simple plywood box with all mitred joints. Then we see a similar flip-top chest with frame and panel construction. From there we move on to a suit-case style caddy with a few simple drawers. Then, progressively, we go through multi-drawer chests, rolling tool carts, open totes and wall-mounted storage, culminating in a full-sized, professional standing cabinet in two pieces that could hold almost all you would need.  Every chapter includes complete cutting and hardware lists for duplicating the projects exactly. (A nice touch is the inclusion of inch AND metric dimensions!) The color photos are superb, the directions clear and simple and the suggestions for variations of design are very helpful.   There is a great emphasis on machining and it almost goes without saying that the router and tablesaw are used throughout the book. There are clear explanations of all fixtures, jigs and gadgets and even old hands will pick up a couple of useful tricks here. I believe the best feature of the book is its user-friendliness. Even real newbies should have no trouble working confidently, accurately and safely by following the text. Your only problem will be getting to keep any of your first efforts for yourself!     
 George Anderson is the best world wide Medium.  Very genuine and sincere in his work. Excellent 
 Ray Nitschke gives  great insight into the human side of professional football. Takes readers on a great journey, from being orphaned as child,  to success with the Fighting Illini, and finally to near immortal status as  a member of The Green Bay Packers. Definitely not your typical pro-athlete  memoirs 
 I first saw this movie about 3 years ago when my older sister brought over the video to my house after she saw it and told me that I had to watch it because we were such dog lovers -- my family that is.  All I have to say is that this movie just about made me bawl so hard that I needed tons of tissues.  It is just such a touching story about family.  Added to this is the cute factor of the animals that acted in there and the comic relief.  The actors also did a great job as well.  Even IF you don't believe in reincarnation, don't write it off and overlook the rest of the story because of that.  While it may not be for some young children or some older children and even some adults as well for we all have our own tastes, it is indeed a treasure for me, now 28 years old, as a movie that is sincere and one of the best movies I've ever seen and would be proud to have in my dvd collection and show to my future children 
 This highly academic treatment of the Middle East provides more detail than most readers, or at least this reader, can easily digest. Lewis is more organized than is evident from the text, the table of contents, or any other clear signal, but the he leaves the reader more burdened than most authors to discover this organization. On casual reading, much of the text appears to be a stream-of-consciousness string of comments with no underlying organization. I suspect this is largely true, but an attentive reader can find themes within the text (slavery, development of the law, the institution of church vs. religion, etc.). Unfortunately, these do not correspond to chapter or subchapter titles, are not entirely contiguous (several topics are reintroduced several times), and, if there is any overall framework to their organization, it has escaped me. Nevertheless, the discussion appears accurate, balanced, and insightful. In particular, the discussion is both respectful of the customs of the Middle East while appropriately honest and critical in its presentation. As an academic discussion, it succeeds. However, the text lacks any sense of story telling, anticipation, or humor that help maintain a reader's interest. It will be a difficult read for those who look to the text for motivation, but for those externally motivated to learn of the Middle East and looking for a good reference, it is an excellent place to start 
 I first read this novel as a twenty-year-old English major student.  That was 30 years ago and I have read many many novels of varying qualities since then but this is still one of my all-time favourites and i come back to it every few years and re-read it with the same enjoyment.  The River Thames with its grisly flotsam, the Boffins and the dust heaps, Venus and his weird bottles, the Doll Maker playing in "heaven", Lizzie and Bella - such different heroines, the sympathetic treatment of Jewish people, and more - I find it all magical!  900 pages and almost every word is a treat to be savoured.... 
 This might be Cheap Trick's best album since Dream Police.  Robin Zander is one of the top ten greatest rock and roll singers...ever.  This album contains catchy, heavy pop-rock by one of the greatest living rock bands.  Support the band.  BUY IT 
 I think it's kind of poetic that I ended up getting the film adaption of Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451". It was because I couldn't find the book anywhere! I don't know how good it is as an adaption, but I found the film thought provoking, well directed and clever.  The film is set in a world where books are banned and burnt. Nothing is to be read, except for the numbers on top of the bottles of pills and sedatives people of this age often take. Books have contradicting ideas, the book burning "firemen" claim. They make people unhappy sometimes, they change people. Authors are raised on high in the world of literature, as if they are more than the people around them. For a happier society, where everyone can be equal, books must be destroyed, they say. Montag is a fireman, a talented one due for a promotion. He has a wife, he has a large television set in the wall (though most people in this world have two), and he considers himself a pretty happy guy. A young woman approaches him on the monorail home, having seen him around for so long on the trip home she felt she should say hello. She asks about his job, and wonders if he ever read any of the books he burnt. It gets him thinking, and he ends up reading a copy of David Copperfield by Charles Dickens that is due to be torched. Like the Firemen say, it changes his life, and suddenly this happy society seems a little more sinister than before...  I think it's a film that flows really well, has a couple of nice directorial quirks, and has that British 1960s feel in it's sets, landscapes and colour schemes, which I always like. It's kind of strange that it's an English film, since Ray Bradbury, the author of the book is American. Ah well. There's a lot of ideas being toyed with here, the nature of memory, of knowledge, of oral traditions, of control. A lot to think about.  Definitely worth a look for sci-fi fans, I think 
 Many readers know that there are authors that release books under a second pen name like Stephen King has his writing alter ego, Richard Bachman, and the late Evan Hunter also wrote under the pseuodnym Ed McBain.  Another such famous writer with two famous sides in Nora Roberts, a well-known romance novelist who also writes under the name J.D. Robb.  Over the course of more than 20 plus books (counting the book Remember When, which is an ambitious "co-authoring" by both Roberts and Robb) Robb has given readers an adventurous look at the future of crime and detectives in the form of Lieutenant Eve Dallas, one of the best officers of the NYPSD in the middle point of the first century of the current millennium.  Throughout the series, Dallas is a tough as nails cop that has definite vulnerabilities due to the fact that she was sexually abused when she was a child by her father and has little to no knowledge of her life save for that.  The only constants in Eve's life (besides work) are her close friends and her lover Roarke, who was originally a suspect in the very first book, Naked in Death.  In this, the third book of Robb's "In Death" series, the story picks up nearly immediately after the events of Glory in Death when Roarke proposed to Dallas.  We find the she accepted the proposal and is trying to balance trying to get ready for her wedding with the help of Roarke and her closest friend, Mavis.  When Dallas goes to visit Leonardo, Mavis' boyfriend and a top designer who has agreed to make Eve's dress, she unwittingly gets involved in an altercation with a high fashion model named Pandora, who reveals that she is Leonardo's lover.  A few days later, Pandora is found dead in Leonardo's shop and due to an argument at a party, Mavis is the prime suspect.  With the case now getting personal, Eve must try her best to solve the case while trying to remain impartial, get her wedding arrangements in order, and uncover a secret drug ring within the world of high fashion involving something called Immortality.  This book has some unique page-turning moments and shows us that for Eve, life as a police detective who is about to be married to one of the richest men in the known world is going to be somewhat difficult but as she has shown in the past, she will be able to handle it her own way.  This is one time that being Immortal is worth it.. 
 Bob the Builder videos are great! I bought these for my 4 year old son, and I am hooked on them too! I can't wait for new ones to come out! I only let my son watch education movies that teach cooperation, manners, etc. I can't stand movies like Rugrats that have rude, obnoxious children that disobey their parents, etc. Bob the Builder is a winner 
 My 12 year old son loves listening to the CD.  He doesn't even consider it school work and I would guess that he is learning a whole lot more than he would from a text book.  It is a wonderful overview of history 
 I absolutely adored this book. I have never really read many mysteries but after reading Murder on the Orient Express I have decided to start reading more. This novel is so great for many reasons. First off, the murder occurs fairly early in the book so you are not bored by tedious non-important facts. I also like this book because it lays out all the characters at the beginning, so you can flip to the front if you get confused. This murder is so full of twists and turns you never know what is going to happen. This mystery keeps you guessing until the end. When the murderer is finally shown you are shocked and bewildered. I think that Agatha Christie did a fantastic job of writing a great mystery. She developed all of the characters so that the reader was acquainted which each of them .She made it so the reader truly cared about figuring out who killed the horrible murder victim. 
 Cheri Huber's books are like treasures to me.  No matter how I feel, I can always pick on up and read starting at any page.  Sometimes that is all I have to start finding my center when I am lost in chaos.  Her books are simple.  The longest one I think is about 230 pages (There Is Nothing Wrong With You) to some much shorter.  Many times Cheri tells us that the practice is very simple, and we can throw away 99% of all books written about it.  However, it isn't easy.  Being still isn't easy.  Facing yourself, or just watching yourself isn't easy.  Think that is foolish? Try it.  Pay attention 
 This book is just great fun to read and highly educational. In addition to being a biography of Alfred Barr, it is a documentary of a moment in which New York replaced Paris as the center of the Art World. Invaluable for understanding the arts and personalities in the art world who still affect us today 
 a classic romantic movie, its so great to see the older movies restored on DVDs.  robert redford is so handsome and as for the song, well, after i saw the movie, "the way we were" became so meaningful and beautiful to me.  
 This green tea has a very smooth mellow taste. I have tried different green teas and this is the best I have every tasted. I have been ordering this product for a couple of years now. If you love a good green tea, this is the one 
 This Girl can sing, can dance, she can do it all!!!Midnight Fantasy is such a great son and so is I.O.U.This cd is WAY better than Geri's cd, Emmas cd, Mel C and Mel B CD.I Love this CD 
 One of the best books I have read in a long time.  Buy it 
 I received the movies promptly and the price was right. Thank you so much. I was very pleased 
 This is very funny film immersed in the great tradition of Woody Allen. A hypnotist (Voltan Polgar)will make a true mess of entangles I this fantastic comedy of mistakes that included the prestigious presence of this talented and beautiful actress. Helen Hunt. A delightful movie that finds an inspired script, a towering cast and obviously, the acid occurrences of this remarkable and irreverent filmmaker.   
 First off, for the audience looking to read this book after viewing the character from the movie LXG, know that the characteristics of Dorian are no as they were in the movie. Dorian does not die when he looks at his portrait; in fact his observation of the changes in his picture is one of the main elements of the story. Basil, an artist that is obsessed with the beauty of one man, Dorian, paints a portrait so beautiful that the subject is pained by the fact that the portrait's beauty will outlast that of his mortal body, and he wishes that this formula could be reversed, with the portrait aging in his place. He gets his wish, but at what price? Dorian, now free from the bounds of mortality, is no longer afraid to sin, since there he thinks that nothing can happen to him. But his behavior was not all due to his immortality; it was also due to the fact that the negative influence from Lord Henry corrupted his pure soul. The fact that he was able to keep his beauty but not able to keep his soul shows that judgment based on appearance is not only wrong, but inaccurate. This book is recommended, but not to the highest extent. The story picks up quickly, as it must with such a limited amount of pages. One of the only flaws in this book is chapter 11, the long, unwanted pause. A classic nonetheless, one that should no be overlooked

 Hilari Bell's A Matter of Profit is one of the most original reads ever. Hilari has a unique ability to capture a reader from the outset of her books, and never free that reader until the tale is told. A Matter of Profit is no exception of this ability of hers. This book deals on a multi-themed scale. Its main themes are spellbinding. It deals with inequality of women roles, how to deal with an alien culture, and the age-old question of what is more important, money or knowledge. Hilari has the ability to create a new universe from scratch, discover new races, develop a dazzling don't-want-to-put-down book, and intertwine many morals all into one story. Hilari's A Matter of Profit is an amazing book as are her other books, Navahor and Songs of Power. These amazing stories come from an amazing source, Hilari Bell's Imagia Nation. Everyone should visit that wonderful country at least once, so pick up one of her books, and read it now 
 The newest Leaphorn/Chee sequel does not disappoint the reader.  The supporting characters were all present and the native (spiritual) customs were explained in their usual forthright manner.........If you are a follower of the Leaphorn/Chee mystery series this book is a must read - And if you are new to this series it won't matter because Hillerman does enough character backgrounding to bring you up to date.   
 This is a straight-forward plan, not diet, to get you on track.  I started the plan with great skepticism, and to my surprise, it was easy to follow, had good meal/shake variety, and gave me a feasible work-out plan.  The other two books in the series add more variety, more recipes, and more variety for the workouts.  Always be your own best judge when starting any fitness/eating plan.  I went from an 'obese'(according to Uncle Sam), 170 pounds on my short 5'2" frame, to pretty fit-looking, and healthy-looking 120 pounds.  I vary between 120 and 125 depending on my amount of exercise, and what I do/don't eat.  Just make a personal commitment to follow the written plan, and you should see satisfying results.  I learned the hard way - don't try to deprive yourself of anything you really, really enjoy.  Just have some in moderation, faithfully do some sort of physical activity, and be aware of how good, or bad you feel.  Always consult your family doctor and keep him/her informed of your plan 
 This is a wonderful, positive book which examines individuals from negative or deficient backgrounds and discovers their keys to success. The Wolin's work identifies strong traits and learned experiences which allow some people to beat the odds. Their chapters teach letting go of the negative, finding talents, skills, mentors and strength to become mature successful adults despite negative childhood or family influences. It is a positive book with a "get over it attitude"  and explanations how.  I find this book helpful as a SELF HELP book for struggles, useful as a clinician working with adults and adolescents and useful as a parent or mentor. Dr and Ms Wolin are also dynamic workshop presenters 
 My boys love this author's version of the Three Little Pigs, so I bought a few more of his fairy tales for them.  They also liked this one, but not as much.  That might just be because it's not quite as interesting a tale!  But the illustrations are well done---especially the troll, who is truly scary looking!  This is a good book for a reader who likes to do voices, as  you really have to use dramatic effect to show how the biggest billy goat  has a loud and intimidating voice while the little one has a tiny and timid  voice 
 If you can get past the fact that the plot in this movie is almost exactly the same as the plot of the original Dirty Dancing, you'll be fine.  Other than that, there's hot music, hot dancing, and hot actors and actesses.  Diego Luna is perfect for the part of the disarming, Cuban pool boy.  It's a fun movie that will make you laugh, cry, and want to get up and dance 
 Legates and Stout do an excellent job of compiling and briefly explaining many seminal writings on cities. There is a lot to read here and I'm not yet finished. But this heavy book is full of informative, interesting and fun writings and provides an excellent introduction to the study of cities. This is essential reading for students of Urban Form, Architecture, and the Social Sciences.  Includes Le Corbusier, Patrick Geddes, Jane Jacobs, Lewis Mumford, J.B. Jackson, Witold Rybczynski and many others 
 This one quickly became a favorite of mine. Ever polemical, working class "everyman," Harvey Pekar, desperate for an outlet in which to channel the frustration he expereinces as a downtrodden oddball, decides to make himself into, as cult comic figure R.Crumb puts it, "a comic book hero," and to entertaining results. As Harvey tells Crumb, "ordinary life is pretty complex stuff."  The revelatory movie-sometimes-documentary is quite unique, funny and touching. The scene where Harvey, his voice reduced to a series of squeaks and raspy whistles due to a vocal chord nodule, pleads with his second wife not to walk out on him, is one of the most pathetically funny attempts at a semi-romantic interlude I've seen in a movie. Out the doors she bolts, as Harvey, played to a T by Paul Giamatti {"Sideways} rolls his eyes skyward and grimaces. Such is life for Harvey.   However, he and Joyce, played by Hope Davis {my wife used to wear glasses like that!} soon "meet strange," as opposed to Hollywood's typical "meet cute," and the curmudgeony, weary Harvey at long last finds the woman who sees in him something most wouldn't. Upon the hilarious closing of their first encounter/date, Joyce suggests they skip the courtship and just get married. In her unique way, with her own idiosyncracies and peculiarities, she compliments Harvey's gloom and doom existence. This is crucial; as a movie telling their story, it is, underneath the usual day-to-day ups and downs, actually a "real" love story of lost hearts and souls finding their way, finding refuge, finding a taste of what's sold to us all as that abstract American dream. Very well done and highly recommended 
 I really enjoyed Jet Li's performance in this movie. It's always refreshing to see unadulterated martial art. There were a few slow moments, but I liked the story line and Jet Li is always easy to watch 
 Few people who are fans of Jesse James or his TV shows "Monster Garage" and "Motorcycle Mania" are ever provided an inside look at the lifestyle and the man behind them, but this book more than delivers! I've always wondered what it would be like to attend one of Jesse's parties, go for a ride with his gang on the L.A. Freeways, or just get a glimpse into the West Coast Choppers workshop. The author and a talented team of photographers takes us deep inside the custom chopper world, leaving no stone unturned. Short of buying your own $80,000 Jesse James chopper, this is the way to go!! 
 On of my favorite artists, look at this book with children - they so love it! It was my table book during the pregnancy 
 "The Riddled Chain" provides a balanced review of current theories concerning human evolution. The author, Jeffery McKee, intuitively explains how the theory of `Autocatalysis' by means of Chance, Coincidence and Chaos can bridge the gulfs between the theories of Phyletic Gradualism, Turnover-Pulse (Climate) and Punctuated Equilibrium. The occasional use of mathematical and computer model explanations for evolutionary theory is refreshing twist in a book written with the layman in mind. McKee is obviously in touch with the past and current trends in human evolutionary theory, in that he is able to articulate past foundations and modern discoveries into a coherent history of the study. This book reads more as a popular science magazine article than as an anthropology text but is useful and enlightening nonetheless 
 An absorbing American tragedy is literately and painstakingly explored in this worthy book.  So many Americans were lynched in the bad old days; why is it that the average American can name, at most, two victims of lynch law, Emmett Till and Leo Frank?  I don't know, but to read this book is to understand why Frank's death at the hands of a mob is a crime that refuses to die.  The author meticulously depicts the yellow journalism of the time, and the rivalries of the Atlanta papers, that all but created the story of the murder of a working-class white girl in a pencil factory at the hands, it was charged, of the factory's young, northern-born Jewish manager.  The story teems with ironies, not least of which is that a well-educated, well-spoken white man who appeared to be a member of the privileged class was convicted of murder and sentenced to die solely on the word of an nearly illiterate denizen of the mudsill, black janitor Jim Conley-who almost certainly committed the crime himself.  It is also a sober lesson in early 20th-century American antisemitism.  A massive outpouring of money and legal talent and support from the papers and philanthropists of the North succeeded at last in commuting Frank's death sentence to life, but lost him to a lynch mob almost immediately thereafter, proving to Atlanta's nearly-assimilated Jews that they were outsiders after all.  Without ever stating his own conclusions-the author almost ruthlessly refuses to provide us any-he makes the case that Frank might have well been creepy, but he was no murderer.  The usual hero of the story is the governor who commuted Frank's sentence, knowing it would end his own career, but Oney's choice is Conley's one-time lawyer, who became an advocate of Frank's innocence.  Oney depicts him with sympathy and admiration; he also draws a moving portrait of Lucille Frank, from her girlhood to her long empty decades as Frank's widow.  I do wish Oney had tried to explain why Conley's lawyer, who firmly but tardily rejected his client's claim of innocence and campaigned to clear Frank's name, ever believed Conley in the first place. And Oney leaves unanswered what to me is the biggest mystery lingering from the Frank case:  why the grand juries, the prosecutor, and the white South at large all were willing to let Conley get away with murder.  Even accepting that the murder of Mary Phagan had been transformed into a crime too "big" to be atoned for with the blood of just another black thug, it is hard to imagine, nearly a century later, how the howling mob was willing to let a black "despoiler of white womanhood" get away.  That mystery persists, but I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in American race relations or in the history of the South in general.  An excellent effort 
 this the fist book i read when i turned 12 my parents bought me this and i was like yeah ok i opened the first page and didn't put it down. the best bit is when Xander and Buffy are in the pipe i highly recomend this book to people it will grip you from start to finsh

Plus, itz got an hour long seazon finale! What a great show. if u loved the prev. seasons, Gotta get this  
 Mary Queen of Scots is one of the most enigmatic figures in European history. In this book, Antonia Fraser gives us a detailed history of not only Mary's life, but her emotions and feelings as she's living through the events. And Fraser doesn't seem to be taking sides one way or the other. She doesn't overly praise or overly villify Mary for anything she did or thought.  Mary became Queen of Scotland at only 6 days old. Around the age of 4 she was sent to France to live and be raised by her mother's relatives because their were too many nobles in Scotland that wanted to kill the child queen to elevate themselves to ruler of Scotland. At 17 Mary is married to the teenage king of France and by 19 is a widow. When she finally returns to Scotland to actually rule her people, she is more French then Scottish and the nobles aren't any more glad to see her than they were when she was a child. There is also the large problem of Scotland having converted to Protestantism and Mary being a devout Catholic. Showing her tender heart and gift for diplomacy, even at a very young age, Mary does not try to convert the country back to the Catholic church. She allows them their religion and asks only that she be allowed hers. Her people respond by trying to kill the priest who performs mass for her and destroy any Catholic symbols they can find.  The question of religion is a problem throughout Mary's tumultuous life as she won't give up her beliefs for anyone. This books shows that even if you are the rightful ruler of a country, you have no power without support from the nobles and an army. Mary fights for any kind of control during her entire reign because the Scottish nobles can't stop fighting each other for power. She is never truly in power as she has little support, except from the common people. Mary is used throughout her life by others to get what they want and she makes some disastrous choices, such as her second husband, Lord Darnley, and her decision years later when she has escaped imprisonment by Bothwell, to go to England instead of France. Once in England she is imprisoned illegally for 19 years, and eventually executed for plotting against Queen Elizabeth.  Fraser has written an excellent account of Mary's life, filled with details and insights as to how Mary came to her decisions and what she was thinking and feeling. The writing flows smoothly and keeps you hooked from the first page 
 I found that the book provides adequate coverage of most areas, however, it falls short of the sort of detail I was anticipating.  I guess if your purpose is to become acquainted with the marquee and its evolution you'll  get a good synopsis. If, however, you are inclined to further tinker with  your car, the performance chapter of the book is fairly imprecise.  If I  wanted a list of tuners I would buy Excellence and read the ads. It falls  short on discussing realiability and driveability given the suggested mods.  From an editing point of view it does not help that the pictures are  lagging several pages behind the text.  Otherwise a fine book giving you a  bit of everything.  Beefing up the DIY mods would make it perfect 
 While the negative reviews here hold a certain amount of water, it must be understood that this is certainly not a "traditional" biography, if a biography at all. I came upon this book from the opposite direction as previous commentators, as an fan of literature with a passing interest in boxing. Tosches' entire ouevre reads much the same way as this text: pop cultural riffing, hyperbolic spiritual send-ups, flourishes of bizarrely germane quotes. But it all works.  I can safely admit that this won't serve as an effective biography for anyone hoping for detailed accounts of Liston's fights, but it is a wonderfuly tempered, passionate work. In terms of boxing studies, if you care at all for the style of Oates' "On Boxing," this is certainly worth a paltry $0.19.   
 First off, I was fascinated to hear a little recap of Wally Lamb's life.  Just a flash, and not full of flash - but still interesting (especially to find how he came involved with female prisoners for this novel).    Lamb did an incredible job of telling the lives of these women who were not always prisoners.  They were once little girls, awkward teenagers, young and old women.  What I appreciate is that Lamb let these women tell their stories, which were quite interesting, without glorifying their crimes.  In fact, their crimes are just a foot-note on the side.    You are left with no decisions on if they're victims or monsters, just their stories 
 When I received it, I read it through and passed it to my home schooled friends, and they loved it.  I highly recommend it  It is great for younger ones, for their are cards to open and things to peak at and art work is beatiful.  
 The title of this book is a little misleading. It is not helping you learn how to think like an entrepreneur. In fact, the book teaches you how to more accurately make assessments that entrepreneurs have to make. If you do that, your entrepreneurial success should be higher.  I like books about avoiding thought patterns that delay or derail progress, and thoroughly enjoyed this one. In many ways, the book parallels the outstanding book about personal decision-making, Smart Choices, that I strongly recommend you read as well.  Why, then, did I rate the book at four stars rather than five? Basically, the book didn't quite get the editing it deserved. There are some minor misspellings of the sort that should have been caught. More seriously, the book indulges in unnecessary vulgar language in a few places. If those things don't bother you, see this as a five star book. It certainly is in every other way.  Some of the subjects include how to overcome risk aversion, how to lay off risk, picking the type of business to go into, establishing a business model that has the best chance of success, and how to have the business match your personality and preferences. These are subjects I feel are important for any entrepreneur, and are often not covered by business books. I was especially impressed by the focus on ethics and high moral tone of the advice.  This book will have value both for people who are thinking about becoming entrepreneurs and those who are already running small businesses. Since the book often focuses on computer consulting and computer-based training, those who are in those fields will find the book to be especially valuable.  As a test of the value of the book's content, I applied the concepts to my own management consulting firm and found that the analyses were accurate and useful. So you can add management consulting as another business type for which this book is good.  One of the things I liked about the book is that it realistically encourages people to think about entrepreneurship. Even if you decide that having your own business is not for you, this book will give you a better basis for feeling confident about that decision.  If you do decide you want to buy or start a business, I suggest you share this book with your spouse and a person who already has a business in the same area. Then discuss your ideas with each of them in terms of the concepts in the book. Their feedback will help you form a more realistic view of your ideas 
 This is the One CD that i can listen to from start to finish without skipping any songs... Engelinas voice is so smooth with the synths behind it. The best song on the album is "high on life" it was supposed to be the next single... but was never released... this album is worth buying!  :) 
 omg this cd is like the best...i knew every song..i listen to it everyday!! it's like the best cd u can purchas 
 This is a good reference book. Helpful information. More photos would have meant 5 stars from me - I love the pictures in daylily books 
 I tried to read this book three years ago, and at the time, I would have heartily agreed with some of the other critiques.  I stumbled through a few of the chapters and tossed it on my bookshelf without another thought.  It did not seem to apply to my life at the time and I thought it was too much fluff for me.  Oh, how little did I know back then!  Fortunately, I didn't give the book away and today I'm glad that I gave it a second chance.  I have learned that sometimes we are not prepared to read certain books at certain times in our lives.  Just because it may not compliment our current mindset, we tend to blame the book.  That is exactly what I did three years ago.  Now, three years later, with my life plate so full that it is overflowing, I saw this book as if it was beckoning me to read it.  This book is exactly what I need to read at this point of my overcrowded life.  The author gives point after point so applicable to me, it feels as if she has read my personal life story.  The instructions are delivered in a delicate manner, yet they are dead on accurate.  Some of the advice hits me to the core.  I can really relate to each chapter.  Sometimes with a nod, and most of the time with an "ouch".  To reap the most of this book, I kept a notebook handy because Talane gives a lot of impromptu exercises.  This is great for getting the creative juices flowing on the spot and for reflecting back on my thoughts at a later date.    There is a famous quote about self development: "When the student is ready, the teacher will appear."  I am glad that I was ready when I took that second look at this valuable book.  I have gained a lot from it and would recommend it to anyone who is READY to take life to the next level. 
 Not my favorite of John H2o's films but has some great one liners; "Babs Johnson? Sounds like a monkey on a tire swing!" Cuddles and the eggman...classic 
 Now here is a book written by a man who gets it. You can read this book as a man or a woman and understand what all new parents go through during this very stressful time in their lives. But to be able to laugh about it is a beautiful thing and to be able to read someone who can write about his own experiences in a sarcastic, edgy yet truly self deprecating way is a true success of a book in my opinion. Which I think should count since I'm a mother and very picky about what I read 
 Okay, let's be brief: If you didn't grow up in the horror lovin' 80's or are not an established fan of Italian horror films, this movie probably won't work for you. This is the unofficial sequel to Romero's "Dawn Of The Dead" (the 1978 version of course) made primary for Italian audiences when Dawn was released there under the title of "Zombi". Even though this one doesn't take place in a mall or feature anything or anyone like the original storyline of Dawn, it does have almost the same feel. Eventually in America, this film came to us with English dubbed audio under the title of "Zombie". But now Shriek Show has finally released a remastered 2 disc set of this classic movie fully uncut for the first time in the states.  Or so I thought.  Ya see, when the movie starts, there's a brief scene set-up (as it always was), then it goes into the opening credits. I was expecting to see the original Italian credits showing it finally under it's original title "Zombi 2", like the box. But it isn't, it's the American version with the title "Zombie". Nitpicking, huh? But after a little searching I found an Easter Egg that shows that original title sequence that finally shows that this film was called "Zombi 2". Here's how to get to it (it's easy....):  On Disc One go to the "Features" section. In there, press the number "6" on your remote. It will activate a red skull button in the upper right on the screen (you CAN'T activate it by searching around the menu with your arrow buttons, very rare by Easter Egg standards!), and it will press the button automatically and take you to the original Italian opening credits and clearly show that this film was called "Zombi 2", logo and all. Also, after they're done, it will show an alternate end credits, but honestly I couldn't see any difference on them as opposed to the ones on the movie now.  All in all, this movie has never looked or sounded better ever. Some say it's looks too cleaned up now. They might have a point because the picture is so perfect now (colors bright, sharp image, brightness exact, sound crisp, etc) that it gives away the effects in the movie. Well, I'd rather have this movie perfect picture than a dark, grainy VHS anyday.  This movie is a classic piece of horror history and should be owned (especially the Shriek Show 25th Anniversary version...the extras here are superior....the making of documentary is as long as the movie itself!) by anyone with two or more "Living Dead/Zombie" DVD's already in their collection. I'm glad I got it, THIS is the way classic horror should be re-released.  P.S.: If you look hard enough (the DVD's trailer section has their previews), there is a "Zombi 3" and a "Zombie 4" movies out there too. Trust me, you don't need them or want them, as they don't have the same feel or quality of "Zombi 2" or "Dawn Of The Dead". Just be happy with their trailers. Enjoy 
 Elkhonon Goldberg has once again created a book that blends his extensive knowledge of neuropsychology and neuroscience, modestly including his own very large (and probably still underestimated) contribution to the cutting edge of the field, and his own introspective experience as a living, breathing brain-owner, into a highly accessible, often playful, yet profoundly elegant treatise on the fate of the brain and cognition over the course of "normal aging."  Similar to his equally excellent and well-received earlier book "The Executive Brain," he writes with warmth and genuine affection for his reader and his material.  As a clinical neuropsychologist myself, I generally prefer the more "textbook" type of presentation to those that are created for popular consumption, but in Goldberg's case, I make a strong exception.  His gift seems to be his ability to "connect" hard science to life experience using accessible language that captures what might otherwise be arcane discourse, instead providing cogent explanation of complex ideas in a lively and inviting fashion.  Goldberg, as a deep and heuristic thinker, has contributed several highly promising and potentially advancing observations to the field of neuropsychology.  Each of these ideas is incorporated into a forward-looking path toward understanding the complex changes in brain function and cognition that take place over the lifespan, culminating for those who are fortunate (and have worked hard for it) into a "style" of cognitive processing that, in more poetic terms, has been referred to through the ages as "wisdom."    One of the more elegant aspects of Goldberg's writing is that while resorting to science to explain what has otherwise required the "poetic," he manages to hold on to the poetry, perhaps even creating some in the process.   
 Door mat looks good and sturdy.  Seems easy to maintain.  Does not lay flat against my tile portch, if that is a draw back 
 This book was great.  Not only did it keep me on the edge of my seat, but it was the first zombie book i've seen that lacks a level of cheese most zombie tales can't seem to escape.  Don't get me wrong, I love most of the romero stuff and can enjoy a little cheese here and there, but I am excited to see that someone has finally taken this genre to serious level 
 Ellis Cose has done it again. He has constructed a provocative and thought-provoking piece that moves across racial and gender lines. Cose, you have to understand is a strong proponent of education. Of course the principal message here is being delivered to young African American males; but anyone with an ounce of empathy and a clear understanding of the human condition could not help but be moved by the message of hope Cose delivers. (The author's spirituality permeates the essay). The bottom line is that Americans (read that all) have opportunities that citizens of other societies simply do not have. Cose challenges African American men to dream and live large. He opines that while "we often have very good reasons to believe the educational deck is stacked against us and...as justified as that bitterness may be, clinging to it will only hurt us in the end...Griping about the state of society, therapeutic though that may be, has its limits as a life-improvement strategy." He points out that whether African Americans take advantage of opportunity or do not the world is not waiting. He deftly provides examples of youth who stepped out of the trappings of a seemingly dead-end existence (out of the box) and stepped up to higher calling and finally to success: to a place where they were able to realize and experience the joy of living in their own skin. In asserting that African American males are uniquely situated to define their place in the world, Cose provides a précis of twelve hard truths that may help them deal with the competition they face in order to achieve success in America. To find the secret: read the book; follow the commandments; and be persistent in demanding what is rightfully and legally yours. Like Ellis Cose, this book is a huge winner. Bravo 
 William Shatner instantly qualified as the Karaoke Kitsch King of the Universe when this kooky collection of actors turned would be rock stars hit the market many years ago. Leave it to retread masters Rhino Records to round up surreal soundbites from over a dozen Hollywood vanity projects ("I act, but what I'd REALLY like to do is sing!") circa that mighty anything goes decade, the sixties. Captain Quirk's hilarious (and...SURPRISE!...wooden) neo-psyhedelic recitation of MR. TAMBOURINE MAN and LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS is very nearly matched in its "so-godawful-it's-terrific"-ness by Leonard "Don't call me Schlock!" Nimoy's renditions of PROUD MARY and IF I HAD A HAMMER, done in a true Vulcan's emotionless style.  Just try to picture Mae West belting out TWIST AND SHOUT, or Eddie Albert tackling BLOWIN' IN THE WIND---naw, forget it---some things have to be heard to be believed. On the other hand, Mayberry icons who actually had singing on their resumes, Andy Griffith and Jim Nabors, acquit themselves reasonably well here, and Sebastion "Mr. French" Cabot narrates a pair of Dylan evergreens in his rich, embracing tones. And Jack Webb, bless him, is Joe Friday, no matter how you present him, so TRY A LITTLE TENDERNESS is the most soulless Oitis Redding cover ever executed, making it an album highlight. GOLDEN THROATS is as much of a mind-blower as running across the odd Telly Savalas LP in your local thrift store bargain bin. RATING: FIVE YOKO ONOS 
 I'm only writing this to warn you that the review right below mine (if it hasn't been removed) has MAJOR SPOILERS.  It reads like a book report and gives away the entire book.  I guess that's great if you want to know what your kid is reading, but terrible if you wanted to read the book yourself.  There's another review a bit further down that has one fairly solid spoiler in it as well.  So, be careful, tread lightly, read at your own risk, etc., etc 
 Just finished reading this book and can honestly say that it was an enjoyable and easy read.  China invades the Spratly Islands, a series of islands which several nations in the Pacific region have claimed, and the United States is drawn into the conflict when an American oil exploration rig is attacked and commandeered by the Chinese.  The book essentially follows the battles and actions of the crew - especially Captain Mackey - of the USS Cheyenne, a Los Angeles class nuclear submarine.  The battles are fast-paced and the enemy is real, but it is definitely helpful if the reader has some knowledge and/or interest in warfare, specifically submarine warfare.  Obviously a work of fiction, but makes you really wonder how "make believe" this situation is in real life.  I'm no naval/submarine expert, but would think that Cheyenne has a great deal of luck, even if the enemy is China and their relatively inferior navy.  Overall, a good read which I did enjoy.  4 stars out of  
 My mom bought me the candlestick phone and it is great. My friends love it, too. It looks really cool and the ringtone it just like my grandmas old phone. I can hear everybody really clear and they have no problem hearing me. I am very happy with this phone 
 It's hard to find that "perfect" Italian book or audio CD to recommend to students, because I often run into these two situations: 1) the book is too in-depth and too focused on grammar; 2) the book is too superficial and more of a phrase-book for travelers, therefore not sufficient. SO, what I usually do is use a combination of books, including audio CDs, this being one of them. It has some useful information on the culture, as well as practical expressions for the brave traveler. However, my recommendation is to take a basic course before traveling to Italy, because even knowing a few simple sentences can get you a long way. Also, in a group setting you'll be able to ask specific questions and to practice with others.  I'm sure that if you check with your local community college, there are some short continuing education courses for foreign languages. Non dimenticare! Don't forget: the trick in learning a language is repetition, so any audio CD that gets you to repeat the words over and over again, is great practice. The more you repeat, the more you'll remember!  It's like learning a song: you can't sing a song you've heard only 1 time, but if you hear it over and over, you'll be able to sing all the lyrics!! So, keep up the good work! If you need information on traveling to Italy and books to learn Italian, you can also contact me: nada@nadasitaly.co 
 This was an interesting read.  Napolitano is a Fox News Contributor who is an advocate of interpreting via natural law and reading the Constitution literally for it's intended meaning.  As a result, the Fox News bashers will tend to ignore the book but it's worthy of their attention too because the leftwing liberal idea of reinterpeting the Constitution for today is what lead to legislation like the Patriot Act.  In an unbiased way (politically), his criticisms of the current administration are well-balanced with a good explanation and examples of abuse.  I've traditionally been a supporter of the Republicans and the Patriot act but the Judge's book have made me rethink the Patriot Act.  I was also surprised at how far back in time some of the interpretation contraversies go, some dating back to Hamilton and Jefferson themselves 
 A very enjoyable book for Lance or Tour de France fans.  Recommended 
 This beautifully illustrated large book shows what's happening in club/discotheque design. Like a lot of the daab books, it basically has no text. Instead it is a collection of high quality photographs showing the latest trends in club design from around the world. And around the world really means all over the world vrom Brazil to Peru, Japan to New York, all over Europe, behind the old Iron Curtain, Israel and more.   Clubs seem to go through styles. From the original dingy cellers to high style, then back to the celler with the warehouse look of exposed beams and utilities, and more recently to a wide variety of styles that combine nearly any look from living room, to theater, to cave.   Consider this as an idea book for club design. It's what the top designers around the world are doing these days 
 I was lucky enough to take a two week intensive course with the author when she still offered those classes in Vermont. This book is excellent if used as a textbook for a class on language esssentials that teachers of reading need, but can also be used alone. Anyone who teaches reading/writing at any level must really know what this book contains!A necessary resource for all who are involved with language instruction of any kind 
 This CD stands on its own merits as good music, not simply as music for a TV show.  It evokes images of America old and new.  O'Connor's violin carries us from the dance hall to the battlefield to the sorrow of lover's lost.  Simple melodies twist and turn, rising up from their solid American roots. James Taylor's solemn rendition of "Johnny's Gone for a Soldier"is as true a telling of the grief of the soldier lost to war today as it was hundreds of years ago.  Sit in a comfortable chair in the warm light of evening and let it surround you. To know where we have come from offers hope that the magic of freedom and liberty will not desert us in these troubled times 
 You can hear the youth and early songwriting from Lucinda on this cd and  it gives us a glimpse of the talent that was just starting to emerge. I  think this is one of the most overlooked records by Lucinda. I love her  voice here and her songwriting  is amazingly strong considering its just  her 2nd record. It has a raw , rootsy feel to it and its still one of my  favorites 
 I LOVE this book! As a college student living in her first apartment, I find these recipes so easy and fun.  I even got my roommates to start cooking too.  Also, I've found this book is a great move-in gift for my fellow students learning how to live on their own.  What better way to help out a college student then helping them forgo pizza everyday? 
 This product is amazing! I have very dry skin and this just soaks in,leaving my skin soft and rejuvenated for days.I even have used it for my  shampoo @ times with good results there,too. 
 "Drummer Hoff" is a book that we read to our three sons as little guys; they are now 18, 22, and 28. My wife and I always enjoyed reading it to them.  Because the book has colorful illustrations, great rhyming words, a fast-paced story, and fun repetition, we bought a copy to read to our 14 month old grandson.  Recently we also bought our grandson a copy of "Goodnight Moon" by Margaret Wise Brown. Jimi brings this book to us every night to read to him. "Goodnight Moon" was also a favorite of his uncles, our sons.  "The Runaway Bunny" by Margaret Chase Brown and Clement Hurd also delighted our guys, so we be buying one soon for Jimi. Maybe he will save these books for his kids.   
 I sat down to read just a few pages before dinner, just to get a feeling  for the subject matter - I ended up reading the entire book all in one  sitting. The very next day, at age 42, I began to apply both the  philosophies and the techniques provided, and after only two weeks, I can  already feel and see the difference that it has made to my weekly exercise  and dietary routine. Covering everything from a general review of human  physiology to strength training (including instruction on using equipment)  to dietary suggestions - A GREAT READ 
 These small gold hoops are a nice purchase - good quality. They don't have much weight or heft to them, but they have good color and shine 
 A dark fable about what went wrong with the Russian Revolution. Brillient, has most of the themes that showed up in 1984 as well as ideas of it's own. Funny at times, sometimes tragic. Well worth reading. It's also short, so there's no excuse to pass it up 
  Not bad so far, the only thing I probably can have used is a clip, or something to help me carry it on the walks 
 After traveling in China for 5 weeks and then reading this excellent book, I really could relate to it. Especially after talking to people in China about the effects of the "Cultural Revolution" this book had an excellent inside. I also recommend the Movie on DVD. J. Hess 
 Slaughterhouse five is by far a great pies of work by Kurt Vonnegut. The story's plot focuses on the life of the protagonist named Billy. The story can be a little complicated being that it is a story in a story of the author's who is a character in the book. The book more or less has no structure in it. The plot structure cannot be described as linear, but rather it is more spatial in its organization. the style of the story to me was almost bleak and depressing, with a subtle mention of science-fiction in it 
 Harry S. Dent, Jr.'s book is remarkable both for the overall accuracy of its predictions and for the simplistic model upon which those predictions depend. Written in 1993, it claims a niche within the general family of "trend" books written by the likes of Alvin Toffler and John Naisbitt. The work anticipated our current era of super bullish markets, which it predicts will continue through 2007. The crystal ball drops a few items, given that a few years have passed since publication. Nonetheless, it offers a clear macroeconomic forecast and investment tool. If you sense the Fed just doesn't get the New Economy, this is the book for you. We [...] recommend this book to those seeking to understand the United States' era of record-breaking economic gains (and Japan's current hard times) 
 Found this book by accident and it may change my life.  Information about the what osteoporosis really is vs. what the medical community has told and scared us about.  Has really exposed the truth that low bone density does not always equal fragile and bones and a broken hip in the future.  Although diagnosed young and on medication for 2 years...I have now gone off the medication based on what I learned from the book and I may be better off for it later.  I wished I had read the book beforehand 
 I did not need to read any farther than the first chapter and realized this was a great book!  As a judge, I am always looking for updated information on horses. This book has great pictures that explain many problems of hunters today.  It is a must have for all judges and trainers and for all disciplines of riders!  Thank you Anna-Jane 
 In erudite and responsible fashion, Greene establishes his thesis by first laying out the nature of the Chesapeake and New England colonies. Virginia, he states, was the result of profit-driven members of The Virginia Company, and therefore a commercial colony from the beginning. It furthermore was an individualist colony and only accepted the idea of a community after realizing it otherwise would not succeed. By contrast, New England was a religious colony wholly devoted to the community, where not until later was any individualism expressed. Having laid that foundation, he then proceeds to criticize the declension model of New England and to propose a developmental model for the Chesapeake.        His criticism of the declension model rests principally in that it assumes a deterioration of New England culture and quality of life. As such, it cannot properly address the demographic and economic changes occurring in those colonies beginning around 1660. Having thus assessed the validity of the declension model, he then proposes his own developmental model for the Chesapeake region. That model states, in essence, that permanent civilization grew out of temporary colonies by virtue of the change from strictly individual, go-it-alone pursuits to the much more practical individual-within-a-greater-community approach. That latter phenomenon, he demonstrates, is a reflection of life and the socioeconomic situation in Great Britain itself, thereby proving that not only does the declension model fail to hold for the Chesapeake colonies, it was never representative of the Old World either.         He then goes on to describe the socioeconomic nature of the colonies in Ireland, the Middle Colonies around New York along with the Lower Southern colonies beneath the Chesapeake, and the island colonies in the Atlantic and Caribbean. In each case, he ultimately asserts their strong similarity to the Chesapeake colonies and the legitimacy of his developmental model theory. In his final chapter, he brings all the colonies together to explain the creation and development of an American society, and the colonial move from separate and distinct colonies to united and similar states.         The style of Greene's argument is very satisfactory; he makes no assumptions, or at least pretends not to, and fully and somewhat repetitively explains how each colony is similar to the Chesapeake and dissimilar to New England. It is constructed, therefore, so the scholarly reader can jump to the colonies of interest to him/her, skip over the others, and still fully understand the argument.         The argument itself is highly intriguing, and well grounded within the evidence he presents. One cannot help but see the merit to what he writes. That said, there are a few points of caution for the academic reader. First, Greene pays no attention whatsoever to Indians, and less attention than he should to slaves. On Indians, he acknowledges as much in his introduction; however, with the exception of Ireland, settler-Indian relations were pivotal to colonial development. What does he have to say of Bacon's Rebellion, for example, or any of a number of such conflicts? What about the fact that the settlers initially survived on Indian-grown corn, later established a considerable trading system, and even acquired land from them? One might also ask about the social development of the Indians themselves. How did colonization affect them? Greene ignores that entirely. Perhaps he considers Indians' happiness irrelevant to the overall American pursuit of happiness. Perhaps it was simply an oversight, or maybe historiography has not progressed so far as to include the Indians. Does that issue or any settler-Indian issues weaken Greene's model? Perhaps not enough to invalidate it (or to enhance it, for that matter), but enough to have merited discussion.        As to slavery, Robert Olwell writes in Masters, Slaves, and Subjects that slaves too had a social structure that changed over time. Yet, Greene says nothing about it. He discusses slavery only as far as it influenced white settlers' social development. Furthermore, the descendents of these slaves still make up a relevant percentage of the American population; thus, one cannot discuss the "formation of American culture" without addressing the slaves. Again, perhaps the social development of blacks would have had no impact on the relevancy of his model; all the same, he still should have considered it.        A second point of caution is his assertion that the wretched civilization in the Chesapeake ultimately brought about the republican virtues inherent in American government. Perhaps, but as New England scholars have long demonstrated, republicanism was intrinsic to Puritan social philosophy, and declension or no, was well-established a full century and a half before the Chesapeake adopted it.         A last point concerns the central argument Stephen Innes makes in his book, Creating the Commonwealth: The Economic Culture of Puritan New England; namely, that Puritan philosophy ushered in capitalism. Whereas the Chesapeake adopted repressive measures to stifle the overall economy in favor of elite wealth, New England largely allowed its economy to grow unhindered. Having titled his book "Pursuits of Happiness," Greene utterly fails to discuss the capitalistic nature of the foundation of that happiness: American culture, economy, and government.         Greene tackles an enormous subject and gives it a specific label - his developmental model - that by its very size is certain to have a few holes, most notably the cautions described above. Despite these three points of caution, however, Pursuits of Happiness is an extremely worthwhile book. It lends itself well to discussion of New England declension and colonial development, and certainly, Jack Greene is a historian of established and deserved repute. One may not agree with any or all of the points of his thesis, but even the most devoted student of Bernard Bailyn would do well to consider them.   
 The information in this book simply can't be found anywhere else. After reading this book I could understand what being a Taoist is all about, but I was also able to actually START practicing.  The philosophy is good, but now I know about deities and holidays and customs.  I even started building my own Taoist altar!  I feel like now I'm finally ready to proceed with integrating Taoism into my life.  I owe this book a lot, and I recommend it highly. 
 I loved this book.  It is far from the typical Grisham legal fair, but something that everyone has thought of doing at least once in their lifetimes - skipping Christmas!  The characters are wonderful - the wife, pathetic, the husband, oh, so stalwart in his resolve to skip the holidays - until a wrench is thrown into their plans.  Do yourself a favor, Grisham fan or not, and read this next November 
 I tend to agree with critics who reviewed this film when it was released.  Not up to normal/past Pixar standards.  I say it is most like A Bugs Life.  A good but not great film.  Music did nothing for me.  Where was the normal stand out musical score?   Standard extras, BUT no Making Of section.  I would have liked to have seen that.  SOMETHING I HATE ABOUT SOME DVD PACKAGES.  THOSE HORRIBLE FLIP DOWN OPENERS.  YUCK!!!!!!  Kids will enjoy.  Nascar fans will enjoy.  Fun but forgettable after you watch it. 
 I was sorry to hear Ms. Stein died before I had a chance to write a letter thanking her for this book. As a beginning gardner I attended a lecture she gave at a local college. My only criteria for landscaping at the time was to find the most colorful, longest-blooming plants, despite their area of origin. Ms. Stein made me realize how important it is to also provide native plants to benefit the creatures we have displaced with our rampant building. A few years ago I bought a 7.5 acre undeveloped parcel and recently had a small log cabin built on it. I plan to spend the rest of my life restoring the prairies, woodlands and wetlands with the help of this book as well as the sequel, Planting Noah's Garden. I hope Ms. Stein knew she had a great impact on many lives. Thank you, Sara.  
 The Dragon Tarot has awesome graphics.  My son loves dragons, and I bought this as his first Tarot deck. The Minor Arcana has the elements symbol on the cards...for Swords..Air, Wands...Fire, Pentacles...Earth, Cups...Water.  The Dragons are the same type for the Swords, etc.  The Major Arcana has the Zodiac and Planet symbols on it.  The Wheel of Fortune has a Lion on one side, a Dragon on the other, and the Wheel with Zodiac Symbols...very cool.  I would like the deck for myself!  LOL  He can really tune into this deck, it's not difficult to understand 
 This is truly a BRILLIANT movie in that it lets one have an unvarnished look into how the "real" hood is really like.  For me this was nothing less than educational.  I could see how individuals may be caught in a web of circumstances and locale (the hood) which they are powerless to escape or ignore.  This is more than just a movie, it is a powerful statement by a visionary director that tears the stereotyes down, and exposes the humanity of the characters.  When watching the movie, I could clearly relate to the characters and feel their pain and anguish --- these were not just thugs and criminals from a poor neighborhood, but humans with hopes, feelings and aspirations, just like you and me.  What more can I say, except: BRAVO! 
 This novel is like the others in the series, which has its good and not so good things. On the one hand, you know what to expect, and if you liked Hotspur, for instance, you'll like this one.  The hunts are a bit less thrilling in this book though.  The pity is, you kinda see who the bad guys are early in the beginning. I love Rita Mae Browns' work, but she's kinda repeating herself lately, with the cat series and this new series (I wonder how many times I've read the line 'murders are so easy to commit, much more than people realise' in these books).  I enjoyed this book, as much as I've enjoyed the others, and I'll buy the next one she writes, but I believe this one was the weakest so far in this new series.  There was less human _and_ animal nature element. A very straightforward mistery, with no twists, which is kinda rare for this author.  Not very complex either.  Some of the new people introduced in this book were potentially very interesting, and I'm hoping she'll use them again in following books (the four school girls looked promising). In short, you'll like it, and it'll make for a very enjoyable evening.  But it won't make you think, about human nature or about delightful Virginia landscapes and/or animals, which, I don't know about you, but was what kinda hooked me up in the first place. The animals' role is minimal.  And the way sister Jane gets involved in the mess is very weak (Why did they call her? When you read the book, the first thing that jumps at you is that they should have called the headmistress.  Not sister Jane.  Hence what I perceive as a weak story-line).  The ending was kinda rushed too. I'm an avid Rita Mae Brown fan.  I live in Spain and it's really difficult to get her books, but I try.  I liked Huntball, and I would have bought it anyway, but I'd probably would have bought it second hand or whatever if I'd been able to.  This one left no aftertaste, no lingering deep thoughts, like the other books did.  Just a pleasurable three-hour reading, and nothing more.           
 I think everyone should read this book!!  If all would read it and take it to heart--I believe we would have a lot less problems in the world.  Get this book and live it!!  It will change your life for the better! 
 IZO through my eyes is a beautiful reflection of the darkside of the human soul.  I don't want to get into the details of the movie because I'm sure enough of the other reviewers already have.  However I'm compelled to comment on how incredible the soundtrack is.  The music is very original, beautiful, and thought provoking.  It's basically poetry to acustic music that narrates the movie throughout IZO's transformation.  On every level IZO is an incredible movie.  I recomend everyone see this and not look for a spoonfed meaning to the events throughout.   I would also like to add that IZO does not just kill everyone without conscience 
 Yes, I'm on a Carlotta Carlyle kick... and this book was a perfect follow-up to Deep Pockets. While DP kept Carlotta and crew in the Boston metro area, Heart of the World takes the show on the road to Miami, Bogota, and beyond.  As usual, the plot is intricate and waterproof. The characters are vivid and unforgettable. And the relationships between Carlotta, Sam, Mooney, and others are progressing to critical inflection points. Something has got to give, and in this book, you'll find out what does.  Carlotta traces Paolina, apparently kidnapped by her drug lord father and taken out of the country. She has to face tough questions about her morality, her relationships, and her past as she tracks Paolina around the world, from the projects of Boston to the highest mountains of Colombia.  Another must-read for mystery fans. 
 I do not follow an organic diet regularly, but the recipes in this book are so delicious!  I have been renting it from the library for the last 3 months and have finally decided I HAVE to buy it!  It is really worth the money!  This book is very well laid out and has simple, delicious, healthy recipes.  
 Future generations will call this the most important novel of the 20th century, or at least they should, for this is the book that expresses the major themes of the world in that century.  What we now call gender issues (now there's a broad label!) occupy a major portion of the novel, but it is  just as much a picture of the Fear of humanity during the Cold War times,  when every day we were 30 minutes from doomsday.  It is about racism and  colonialism and the fading of empire; it is about the breakdown of society  in the technological age; it is about single mothers; it is about mental  states and breakdowns.  It is about Communism, and have we not heard the  20th century called the Age of Communism?     All this is not what makes  this a great novel.  Each time I've reread it, the more it seemed I could  almost put my finger on something-a question of identity, or what it means  to be human.  "Breakdown" is a word appearing throughout the  novel-by the end, it almost seems to mean "break through":  break  through the rhetoric, break through the categories.  The Golden Notebook  speaks to deep emotions-something there is that needs to shine through, to  grow, to love and to be loved.  This novel reached down to that.  It is  sometimes painful, sometimes provoking a fear/hate reaction, or a feeling  of dislocation.  This is the kind of book that you often have to slap down  on the table, pace the room, and work off the tension that has built.     Doris Lessing wrote once that she considered this novel something of a  failure, for it only names the issues, exploring briefly, but not solving.   I can see what she means-this is a novel that forces the reader to wrestle  with themselves as much as the characters.  This is why some people read  the novel and yawn, and why some read the novel and are profoundly changed.   One must be at a crossroads, unsettled.    Read this book.  Let it change  you 
 "When I speak about love and compassion, I do so not as a Buddhist, or as a Tibetan, nor as the Dalai Lama. I do so as one human being speaking with another". With these words, the Dalai Lama opens his recent guide to expanding one's circle of loving relationships through the practice of love and compassion. This book is simply and eloquently written, and its teachings are wise.   The Dalai Lama points out that human beings are essentially alike when superficial differences are pealed away. In addition, all religions are essentially alike to the extent they teach love, kindness, and peace and "a desire to help their fellow beings." (p.4)  The Dalai Lama presents a way of understanding these insights and a means of bringing them into focus in one's life through the practice of lovingkindness.  Some of the teachings in this book make use of specifically Buddhist beliefs such as the doctrine of rebirth.  But the practices and principles of this book can be used with benefit regardless of whether the reader accepts or doesn't accept rebirth or other specifically Buddhist doctrines.  The Dalai Lama sets forth a process of reflective understanding and meditation in first understanding the nature of love and then learning to practice it. It is an inner-directed teaching in that it looks to the self and to self-understanding rather than to externals -- to things beyond one's control such as wealth or power or to success -- as the key to happiness.  Thus, the first part of the Dalai Lama's teaching in this book is directed to an understanding of the basic purity of the human mind.  Because the mind is pure, it is possible, for the Dalai Lama, to remove defilements such as hatred, lust, and ignorance.  The radiant, empty character of the mind also links all human beings together in terms of establishing a commonality and an ability to love and be loved.  It teaches that people ought not to be categorized in that beyond the defilements that plague all of us, we are essentially human with the need to be loved and to be free from suffering. This teaching of the pure, radiant mind ("Buddha nature") possessed by all is the most fundamental and difficult teaching in this book.  The Dalai Lama then presents a series of seven steps to increase one's ability to feel love and compassion for an ever-growing class of people and sentient beings.  The process is presented in gradually expanding steps, and the reader can follow the path as it develops.  Each step is accompanied by teachings and by suggested meditation practices.  these seven steps are 1.creating a positive attitude towards others; 2. recognizing the kindnesses each of us has received; 3. reciprocating the kindness of others; 4. learning to love others (including learning the difference between disinterested love and love based upon attachment, such as physical or sensual desire or upon the receipt of benefits from those close to us); 5. practicing compassion, the desire to have others free from suffering; 6 becoming committed to altruism -- to training one's mind to and working for the welfare of others; and 7. realizing enlightenment in terms of being devoted to the welfare of others.    The teachings in this book are in part guides that everyone can use regardless of his or her religious beliefs, and in part a simple exposition of the bodhisattva path of Mahayana Buddhism. The Dalai Lama makes frequent reference to ancient Indian and Tibetan sources, including the Tibetan "Stages on the Path to Enlightement" (pp 7-8), and the teachings of the great Indian sage, Nagarjuna (pp. 190 -- 197).  Each chapter of the book is headed by a short quotation from a Buddhist source that the Dalai Lama amplifies in the teachings that follow.  This book is short and a pleasure to read, but there is no suggestion that the teachings are easy.  Work on the mind and on learning to love is a project of years and lives.  The Dalai Lama has written an inspiring guide to learning to love.  Robin Friedman      
 I have read a few organization books. this book helps you find your 'organization style'. I thought it was great. Really easy to get through, tells you how to make lists. The book is not an instruction manual, it is really only suggestions on what to do. If you give them a chance and actually do them, things will be easier. 
 This record is a perfect sampler of COLTRANE's early free jazz style that will go increasingly difficult to digest later on with ASCENSION.Some people will even question the fact that it can qualify as music.With IMPRESSIONS, JOHN had perhaps reached his peak in all aspects.The interplay with ERIC DOLPHY shows two great musicians willing to experiment and those two were so remarkably talented.COLTRANE was jazz's last great innovator and long pieces like IMPRESSIONS are a battlefield to showcase his machinegun imagination.Not a record to buy if you're not inclined to that kind of jazz,but a delight if you are game 
 This book is a fascinating study of female killers.  While the author makes several empirically false statements about female crime (for example, "women get heavier sentences than men", p. 9) she does provide us  with an entertaining selection of crime and punishment involving women  murderers.  From brutal serial killers like Belle Gunness, whose crimes  "speak powerfully to the vengeful, man-hating part of every  woman" (p.138) to the stories of battered women who kill, Jones offers  up a feast of delciously detailed murder in all its glory.  Jones  illustrates how race and class as well as gender affect how we view crime.   This book shows how society's view of women has affected both the  prosecution and sentencing of women who kill

 Actually, 3 1/2 stars.  In his brilliant introduction to this novel, Nabokov makes several disclaimers as to the book's influences, motivations, and possible applications.  He claims that any Kafkaesque similarities are strictly co-incidental; that the birth of the novel in those years in which Stalinism and Nazism were gaining more control over thier respective populations was of no importance; and that any possible psychological ramifications sniggered over by the Freudians are simply ridiculous -- that the novel is nothing more than a "violin in a void."  And while any Kafka influences can partially be argued away by the fact that Nabokov did not know German, it is harder to discount the turbulent political upheavals that were taking place during the novel's composition.  It would be very difficult, I think, for Nabokov, a refugee from Bolshevik Russia and living in Berlin, to be unmoved by what Hitler and the Nazis were constructing and by the irony of fleeing one form of evil to be witness to the birth of an even greater evil.  Although the influence of the political machinations of 1934-35 Berlin (during which time the novel was written) cannot be discounted, this is not just a political novel.  Nabokov, in most of his work, has concerned himself with the issue of individuality and how the individual is perceived by a collective society.  He first broached the subject in depth in his earlier novel, The Eye, in which identity and the perception of that identity become so confused that the reader is left wondering just what has happened.  In this novel, the protagonist, Cincinnatus C., is accused of "gnostical turpitude" or being "opaque" in a world in which everything is transparent and immediately known to society, where ceremony is valued over intellect and where rationale becomes nothing more that nightmarish absurdity.  Cincinnatus, by thinking rationally, clouds up the crystalline clarity of collective thought and is considered dangerous.  He is sentenced to death.  This is a brilliant novel thematically, but falls a bit short when viewed in its totality.  Too often Nabokov seems a bit overburdened by his subject and the usual fluidity and poetry of his style is sadly missing.  There is the usual Nabokovian comedy and irreverence but when compared to his more polished works this novel leaves the reader a bit confused and un-satiated; it does, however, makes one think and is as relevant today as when it was written, especially when we seem to be bombarded with poltical rhetoric that sees only one moral and political absolute and does not allow for any opaqueness. 
 This book is a quick way to get your hands on a dozen different Linux distributions. Some you can boot up directly (KNOPPIX and Damn Small Linux) from the CD and DVD that come with the book. Others you can install (Fedora, Debian, and others) from the same media.  If you have not used Linux before, the book was designed to help you install Linux, run basic applications (music/video players, word processors, Web browsers, email clients and so on), use the shell and desktops, and configure basic servers (email and Web servers). All the software described comes with the book, plus hundreds of other applications there wasn't room to cover.  If you are a software developer, but haven't used Linux, it presents the programming tools and environments that are available to help get started. The book also has a whole part that describes a dozen different Linux distributions, the communities that produce them, and features that make each special.  An experienced Linux person might want to use this book to find out about other Linux distributions or just have the media to show off many different Linux systems. But more likely, they would want to give it to a friend whom they want to let in on the secret.  I hope you enjoy my book. -- Chris Negu 
 Walt's book is an excellent introduction to the complex field health policy. Her approach, describing power and processes, enables her to review health policy from many different angles. It describes how policy is made, who is involved, what their influence on policy is or could be, etc. Walt uses several cases to illustrate her views. If you are a health care worker, or a student in the field of health care policy, like me, this book is one to hang on to 
 This item is great.  It keeps my chicken upright, there is no beer can to dispose of after the chicken is cooked, no grease gets in my grill, it holds the chicken while I carve it, and it cleans up super easy.  I have recommended this product to friends and family 
 What more can be said about Raymond Chandler's first novel, published in 1939? Dashiell Hammett may have preceded Chandler with Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon, but Chandler's style, as well as protagonist Phillip Marlowe, stand on their own.  Both Hammett and Chandler can be credited with creating this genre, from which the work the likes of Mickey Spillane, Erle Stanley Gardner and Elmore Leonard spawned. While none can perhaps be considered literary art, they are nonetheless art within their genre. Chandler's first person narrative sparkles with Marlowe's dry wit:  I went back to my office and sat in my swivel chair and tried to catch up on my foot-dangling.  And:  Then she lowered her lashes until they almost cuddled her cheeks and slowly raised them again, like a theater curtain. I was to get to know that trick. That was supposed to make me roll over on my back with all four paws in the air.  The story, too, is perhaps ahead of its time, dealing in part with L.A.'s infant pornography business, something at which, in the movie version starring Bogart and Bacall, didn't really even hint.  Chandler has been praised as a star of the first magnitude and knocked as a world class drunk, but William Faulkner, no stranger to drink himself, wrote the screenplay from a novel he scarce understood. Faulkner had to ask Chandler who killed the Sternwood chauffeur, to which Chandler replied, rather sarcastically, "I don't know." Truly, the movie version was more a vehicle for Bogart and Bacall than for Chandler's genius.  This noir may not appeal to everyone, but I got a kick out of reading a period piece, a fun read and one that holds a solid place in American noir literature.  Recommended 
 The Music - Classic chillout to its finest!! The use of drums remixed with jazzy electronic beats is incredible.......not forgetting the vocals by Sia Furler, Sophie Barker, and Mozez. Totally mesmerizing and fresh. Very melodic and cool indeed!!  The Artist - Good virtuoustic use of electronic and ambient downtempo beats and rhythms. It takes some time to appreciate, but believe me when I say that it's well worth the effort! Even the song "In the waiting line" was featured in the TV series "Sex and the City". Zero 7 in my mind are the masters of downtempo chill.   CD good for - A relaxing bath in the tub (a jacuzzi would be preferable), a nite alone at home, before bed or with a favourite book.   A great album for just about anything! Please get one or you're gonna regret later!  
 I hate greasy moisturizers and that cannot be said about this product. I only used a trial size so didn't see lasting effects but I loved the feeling that it left behind after applying. 
 Ross Macdonald describes America the way it really is, mindblowing, desperate, full of paranoia!! His descriptions of faded starlets and worn-out harlots wandering around Hollywood, talking tough and acting mean, he describes the slums, the shady characters out to make a buck, the cops with trigger fingers and intolerant faces, it is all  there.  I have reccomended his books to friends in Europe, they don't seem to see it the same way I do. I bet it's still a damn good read for most people 
 The title says it all. I often compare this book to The Alchemist but Life of Pi has far more humor to it 
 It seems the average quality of mainstream dance has gone up.  That, or Bad Boy Joe just knows what the heck he's doing.  Either way this mix blows #1 out of the water!  It's darker, harder, and nastier than the first.  It has a more clubby feel than the europopness of the first, as well.  One track in particular seemed almost devilish in it's chipperness.  Carolina Marquez - The Killer's Song features the infamous dirge whistled by Daryl Hannah in Kill Bill V.1.  Not only is it delivered over a fiercely shady dance beat, but Carolina's vocals and accent are seedy at best, and it makes me shiver to think about just how much I love the song.  Another standout track is The Lovefreekz.  The song is pounding, high energy, and very...positive.  The lighter happier side of dark dance.  I loved the song on Ultra Dance 6, and I love it here.  All around, this compilation kicks boot-ay!  The same boot-ay you'll be shaking after you buy it 
   Liza Pickard is a barrister with a mighty pen.  She has authored several books about London. These Include: Life in Elizabethan London: Restoration London; Dr. Johnson's London and now this fourth book in the series.   Picard has done her homework: her reading of first person diaries and sources; periodical articles from the age. She includes excellent secondary sources giving the reader an accurate view of life when Victoria reigned the British Empire. The little Queen ruled for 64 years from 1837 to her death in 1901.  Picard's chapters deal with such topics as: daily life for the poor, middle class and wealthy; the smells and the sights of London; male and female fashions; church life and the judicial system of Victorian England; Amusements from opera strolling in the park to riding a horse on Rotten Row. Household appliances and the chores of childrearing; Disease and Death traditions. Medicine made progress. the growth of the railroads and road construction; the Great Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851; Education expanding its opportunities through Ragged Schools and church schools.   There are many other topics but you get the idea. The book is not thrilling but it is essential to a student of English history or literature who wants to sample life for the average Londoner living from  1840-1870.   
 It's always good.  From the early, more electronic sounding albums that I first fell in love with, to the later more raw and edgier sound on the later albums like Comatose; it's always a good choice for listening.  I put in this CD and my mood always lifts.  Even if I wasn't in a bad mood at all, I still find myself smiling even more.  There are times when I do miss the older sound because I liked it first, but I still love Comatose 
 Gebhardt's Chili Powder ah, I have been searching for a long time to find it again.  It is the best, most perfect, a complex and interesting aroma, flavor a bit of sweetness, a back-of-the-mouth herbiness, forget hot ones - you can always add heat, but seldom does one encounter a flavor so amazing.  Great used in the usual ways, but also a pinch added to fudge or chocolate icing, or to peanut butter cookies!  Mixed with some lime juice as a dip for crisp toast, lightly sprinkled inside a trout.. 
 "Wings" is one of the best silent films ever made.  It deservingly became the first movie to win the Oscar for Best Picture (1927-1928).  It stars Clara Bow, Charles Rogers, and more, including a cameo appearance by then-unknown Gary Cooper.  This film was ahead of its time with its visual effects, cinematograghy, and plot.  Few other films at the time successfully made such elaborate scenes realistic looking.  They obviously made great use with the technology that they had then.  Few films were able to take a chain of events and spread them out to keep the audience's interest for over two hours.  This plot is brilliant!  It explores two friends who travel to Germany to fight WWI.  Little do they know is that they left the same girl behind in the US.  The drama and the war theme combine beautifully, keeping the emotion intact.  The lucky charms add an added interesting touch.  The acting is wonderful.  Clara Bow, the 1920's "It"-girl(and the Marilyn Monroe of the 1920's), beautifully and emotionally plays her role as a woman left behind by her "friend" fighting in the war who struggles to get him to realize that she's in love with him.    The men who play the soldier friends add their own harsh was realisms into the film.  Such performance the movie its added enjoyment.  "Wings" is a great movie for those looking for war sequences.  Even those not interested in silent movies will enjoy this.  Those who watch it will easily figure out why this movie is a classic 
 Great video - easy to follow.  Dances are clean and fun to do 
 This is my first power console so I don't have anything to compare it with, but I bought a huge Sony HDTV last year and knew I needed something better than that cheap surge protector I was using. I found this item for less than $150 on this site which was cheaper than those beefed up power strips that Monster sell at Cicuit City. When it arrived I was surprised at how heavy the box was. This thing is built very well! It has several outlets on the back that are labled for different devices. Some of them are "switched" which means they are only turned on after you power on your receiver via the remote control. This is good for those of you who have external amps to prevent that turn off thump you may get when powering down. The supplied instructions were decent at explaining how to best use the different outlets for your system. The only thing I found confusing was the remote control, but I soon realized that you simply plug the supplied cord into the back of your switched receiver and the other end into the remote input on the back of the power console. Devices that are plugged into the switched outlets will ony be turned on when your receiver is on.  After reading other review some people post claims of improved picture and sound quality but I do not see any difference in my equipment. None the less I'm confident that if a voltage spike were to occur my equipment would be well protected.   The styling of this thing is very nice. It's as good looking as any component and I have mine displayed with the rest of my equipment. I only wish that is was black to match my stuff but that's ok. It has a cool blue display that shows you the voltage of the outlet it's plugged into and amps you're drawing as you turn on your equipment. It has several levels of dimming so you can adjust the display to your liking. It has a 12ft power cord so you shouldn't have much of a problem plugging it in.   Like a previous reviewer said it's hard to tell how well a power console is working until something goes wrong, but I'm confident that it will do it's job protecting my equipment when something does 
 This is a very good introductory book for stock trading. Its concept of CAN-SLIM system provides an entry point for novice of how to do stock trading. Besides, it also points out many bad habits of major investors which should be avoided. Even for experienced investors, this book is good for review too 
 This book is intended as an introductory to Project Management. It covers all the fundamentals and then some. First it covers the Revised Project Management Body of Knowledge (PIMBOK). Naturally it is not the PMBOK but it is a complimentary view for those getting into the field of project management and related disciplines.  There is more to this book than meets the eye. Many of the charts are in strategic location of the book and again in appendixes. This book can not be everything for everyone but if you look in the index you may find there is more here than in most introductory books. As a test the first thing I looked for was risk standard deviation and it was there under a section on "Three Point Estimate."  The glossary not only has terms used in project management but also common words that are used differently in project management. Such as "Warrant Period" - A period of time when the stakeholders can notify the team id problems and have them corrected immediately.  I am a little confused on the description of the Author as the back cover says that Kim Heldman, PMP, has over ten years of experience in project management. Yet inside it the book states Kim Heldman is the Chief Information Officer for the Colorado Department of Natural Resources. She has over 14 years of project management experience in the information technology field.  True that there are different methods not covered in the book and also how to integrate the information into different disciplines and coordinate with agencies as the FDA. But those subjects are for a different book.  Anyway you look at it this book serves its purpose and can still be used for years to come as a reference. 
 First off, allow me to say that I'm shocked this book hasn't had more reviews.  This book was a major turning point in my Life.  After working the "American Dream" i.e. 50 hour work weeks and having zilch to show for it in 3 years, I had a nervous breakdown.  Luckily I survived and made it through.  Afterwards, I searched the bookstore for a genuine book and found this diamond in the ruff.  Wow, was I not dissappointed!  This book is totally refreshing for the stressed out individual.  Like the heading I wrote proclaims, welcome BACK to your childhood and to the Mystery thereof.  After reading this book, I realized that unless one enjoys Life, it is simply not even worth living!  Sounds harsh but it's true, you know it.  Lin Yutang boldly stands for the human condition.  This book relearned me on the fun of my childhood.  How could we have gone so far astray?  I've dove head first into various religions which did do some good but really only left me full of dogmatic doctrines and repetitive rituals.  The Bible says that we should be as children.  What good is that advice without a proper manual for the return to this innocense?  This book is the manual leading one back to the joys of those not so distant memories.  I recommend it to everybody I meet.  Take back that precious gift which was stolen from you, the Mystery of Life.  Just because you are breathing and active does not mean that you are truly Living, never forget the importance of it!  Stand with us and don't look back upon, otherwise babblonn!!!  And thank you!! 
 This is a good book indeed. However, the description is very misleading.   It is basically compilation of job search engines all over the world. Search as hard as you want, you won't find any info on visas and permits or tips and tricks how to persuade a foreign employer hire you.  You can find it in Google or A9, if you search hard enough. However, this book also gives you brief description of each site. On the downside, web is a dynamic place so many links are outdated or irrelevant.  I wonder if the people that called it a Bible and told that it includes the "dirt of finding jobs" actually read it 
 I absolutely loved this book.  The pages turn very quickly and I would highly recommend it. Even if you are not into law books or stories, this book will keep you guessing and you will like it. 
 the young man who used it said the ACT was much easier this time around (he was taking it for the 2nd time). The question format made more sense and he had a better idea of what htey were looking for. He hasn't got results yet.. 
 I love this mixing bowl. It is sturdy enough to last forever. It is large enough to mix up a nice big salad or baking mix. Clean up is a breeze. I bought it to replace a plastic bowl that was scratched and stained and looked horrible 
 I would love to have the DVD,I have the VHS,It is funny,I've loved this since I was a child 
 I learned more about CSS from this book than from a CSS textbook from my college course 
 Addictive, Exciting and Honest Look At Amateur Boxing  4.75 Stars  George Plimpton is quoted as having said that The Gloves "As good a book as any I've read about the sport" - not exactly a ringing endorsement and I was a little worried -  This is actually a great book right from the start.   I was immediately hooked and addicted to his trainer's (Milton) style of fighting - something about the concept of Southpaw's just grabs me and especially a non-natural Southpaw - anyway that's what truly hooked me in.  The story is true - and the experience of reading Anasi's practice and journey through the world of amateur boxing is so real and compelling that you just can't put the book down.  The characters and people he meets and trains with are very interesting and he does such a great job in retelling his tale.  There was a point where the book dragged a bit, but as a whole it's a great story.  It's an impressive, exciting and honest look at amateur boxing, of amateur boxers and the sport of boxing in general.  Great book - give it a read. 
 This book is a reprint of the now-classic work that was first published by Scholem in the 1960's, and still an excellent intro today.  Not a "New Age" work by any means, Professor Scholem's book takes an academic  (but readable) approach to such questions as: The meaning of Torah in  Jewish mysticism, the nature and purpose of kabbalistic rituals, religious  authority vs. mysticism, etc.  Of special interest is the chapter,  "The Idea of the Golem," which presents the theory that, contrary  to popular folklore, the Golem was not some sort of physical automaton.   Rather, it was a group exercise in meditative visualization 
 Excellent book!  Gets to the heart of a woman's heart and to her relationship with men, with other women, and with God.  Very empowering.  Very healing. This book exalts God and helps us to understand who we really are and are meant to be.  As a Christian egalitarian, I found the book empowering for both my husband and I and a resource for discovering greater strengthening and intimacy in our Christ-centered covenant of marriage 
 EXCELLENT BOO 
 This is a very handy item.  It can be lowered or raised according to what you need.  I needed it to hold a tabletop Christmas tree at the holidays and it was terrific. Now I used it as a lamp/end table with a decorative tablecloth and topper. The item is very sturdy, much more so than the little round tables you can buy to act as lamp table. I bought a smaller one for my office to expand my counterspace.  It can be folded up when I don't need it.   
 We the people of the United States like to think of ourselves as peace loving icons, holding ourselves up above the petty problems that affect the rest of the world. And there is a certain amount of truth to that.   On the other hand, consider Sweden and Switzerland who haven't been in any wars for several centuries. The conclusion has to be that the United States has a fairly war-like culture.   This book is written from the standpoint of looking at the present war in Iraq. His thesis is that this is not the first time we instituted a regime change. He starts with an analysis of what he calls our first first one, the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893. (Being a Yankee he forgets the one about twenty years before that, but we Confederates remember.).   I believe that the only redeeming grace we can offer is that in general the regime changes we have instituted have not been nearly as bad as say the Germans in Poland, the British in Zululand. While we've had incidents such as the one in My Lai, it was nothing like the Japanese Rape of Nanking. Indeed, in places such as the Phillipines, Germany and Japan we've fairly rapidly pulled out. 
 Modern readers may find the dry style this book is written in a bit boring, but the subject matter makes up for it. Weber looks at 4 branches of Protestantism (Calvinism, Pietism, Methodists, Baptists) and how they each affected the development of modern capitalism. It also sheds light on some of the origins of modern Western beliefs 
 "Can't Buy Me Love" (1987) was probably made to cash in on the rush of 80s romantic comedies but it succeeds where others fail, mainly because "Love" has a real message to send out - - be very careful what you wish for; you just may get it and it may not be what you thought you wanted. Patrick Dempsey, pre-Grey's Anatomy, is Ronnie Miller, a nerdy, smart kid who hates being in the unpopular group, who can't sit in the home section at football games and can't sit anywhere near the "cool" kids in the school cafeteria.  He's been saving up for many summers (cutting grass) to buy a really awesome telescope.  He goes to the mall to get it and instead runs into Cindy Mancini (Amanda Petersen), the girl of his dreams, who is pretty, popular and the head cheerleader.  Although they go to school together and Ronnie cuts her grass, Cindy doesn't even know his name.  Cindy is in a predicament - - she has worn her mom's off-limits suede outfit to an end of summer party and got wine spilled on it.  A replacement is a thousand dollars - - which Ronnie happens to have handy.  He forsakes his telescope, instead "paying" Cindy a thousand dollars to pretend to be his girlfriend for the first month of school. As imagined, the alleged match is met with skepticism and horror by the "in crowd" and just plain skepticism by Ronnie's old friends, who he will soon abandon for life in the fast lane of the popular kids.  Cindy makes Ronnie over, to make him look more hip and cool, and she soon begins to see more in Ronnie than originally met her eye.  But their one month contract is up, and Ronnie has come to believe his own popularity.  Will Ronnie fall from grace with the popular kids?  Will he realize that Cindy has fallen for him?  Will they get together? Pretty basic stuff, but "Love" is such a fun movie because it will really remind you of high school.  The popular kids look down on the "nerdy" kids, picking on them when bored.  The popular girls that never gave Ronnie a look when he was sitting with the nerds are now falling over each other to date him, once he is "seeing" Cindy.  Cindy proves to be a pleasant surprise - - she is pretty, blonde and a cheerleader, but she has depth.  She is a secret writer, something she shares only with Ronnie - - and she complains to him that she doesn't "do" anything but hang out and shop, and she wants to do more, but people don't expect anything else from her.  Touching stuff.   Amanda Petersen is wonderful as Cindy - - you can feel her admiration and affection for Ronnie building, and feel as crushed as she does over Ronnie's transformation into the media monster who believes his own hype.  What ever happened to this appealing actress anyhow? The message the film sends across is perhaps a little schmaltzy towards the end (only filmmakers in Hollywood think that popular kids in school are going to applaud what a perceived nerdy kid says in the cafeteria) but incredibly satisfying.  While feeling that Ronnie deserves the come-uppance that he gets, you also feel sympathy that he was exposed in such a public manner and that he is blacklisted not only by the popular group but also by his former friends.  Patrick Dempsey brings a tenderness and yearning to Ronnie that makes him so appealing, even when he's being full of himself.   Does Ronnie get his girl at the end?  Well, it is a romantic comedy and an 80s movie, so that answer should be fairly clear, but it's a fun journey to get there! A really sweet and endearing film - recommended. 
 This is an abbreviated version of the _Divine Office_, the British version of the Liturgy of the Hours. In the US the one volume "short" version of the liturgy of the hours is called "Christian Prayer".  CP is sliced and abridged out of the 4 volume official US translation.  _Daily Prayer_ is the British equivalent to this.  It has Morning and Evening prayer in a psalter, and separate psalters for Night prayer, an abbreviated Daytime prayer psalter, and just the psalter with no readings for the Office of Readings (No readings for Readings, hmmn.  I'm too sleepy at 3AM for them anyway ;^).  There is a proper of seasons and propers and commons of saints, doctors of the church and such.  The book is medium hard to use, but you should know that these volumes are notoriously difficult for the uninitiated.  US customers should know that this is not the official version of the Liturgy of the Hours for the US.  If your reason for prayer is to pray along with the greater church, this volume is not approved by the US bishops.  (It is approved in many other countries, however) The book is a nice size, a little smaller than the Pauline Christian Prayer version.  I really like it. Now if I could just find an equivalent version in Latin... and get my Latin back up to speed to use it ;^)  Peace 
 I've read all three of Ilene's books. Each one has prompted laughter and tears. I've always been left me with joyful feelings and upon completing the reading wanting more from this wonderful author.  She always hits the  nail on the head. Her work is honest, truthful and right from the heart.   As a man, a father and a husband I too can identify with everything she  writes.  It's not just for women 
 I think Gilbert Law Summaries: Torts is a solid commercial outline.  I am glad I spent the money for it.  I used the book for my first year torts class.  I found the book to be useful as a review resource once I spent time reading/briefing the cases.  Buy it and use it as a supplement, not a replacement for class prep and case briefing.   
 No special effects and no cheesy gimicks. What you do get with Working Girl is a wonderful blend of acting talent (Harrison Ford, Melanie Griffith [believe it or not] and Sigourney Weaver)and outstanding chemistry by both principal and supporting casts.   How good is this movie? Even a gifted director couldn't hurt it. Mike Nochols does a fantastic job of making these varied talents meld into magnificense. The best example is when Jack (Harrison Ford) meets Tess ( Melanie Griffith) but does not reveal his identity. The result was one of the most memorable moments of the film:  Tess proclaims: "I have a head for business, and a bod for sin...is there anything wrong with that?"  Astonished, Jack quips "No...I didn't know they let bad girls into these things."  The film is filled with moments such as these. The supporting cast is awesome. Joan Cusack deserves special kudos for her performance.  "Coffee, Tea...ME?"    This film is a must for any respectable collector. I highly recommend that you buy this film, not just rent it.     
 Ms. Freedman's non-fiction account of her journey to Orthodox Judaism is a gripping, realistic portrayal of one woman's transformation.  In a modern American world often presenting a false choices of pure secularization and self-serving fundamentalist, evangelical Christianity, Ramona Freedman guides the reader through her personal experiences and hardships in reaching her ultimate destination of Orthodox Judaism.  Perhaps most importantly, the book can be viewed as a primer for anyone considering a more introspective approach to their religious upbringing, regardless of their specific spiritual affiliation.  The author's approach is very readable and clear, and surprisingly takes us across many continents and lands.  Moving from the personal experiences of meeting her future husband to her friends and family's reactions to her move toward Judaism, Ms. Freedman weaves a rich story that will appeal to many different groups of readers.   Unlike other modern religious non-fiction I have read, Freedman tells the reader of several of the difficulities and hardships she encountered on her journey.  The story can be read on many different level and readers will take away many important lessons, some of which have less to do with religion and more to do with life and self-improvement.  The book includes a handy English glossay of many of the Hebrew and Yiddish words that are included in the text, as well as the Jewish Lunar Calendar and a list of works where readers can find more information of exploring topics in modern Judaism.  However, this book is less instruction than great storytelling, of a young woman's connection to her ancestor and her journey (and struggle) to move to religious Jewish observance in an increasingly modern world 
 Burdette Weaver (Bird) is a middle schooler living in Freedom, Georgia.  Her two goals are to get noticed in town and to go to Disney World.   Bird's one friend is her neighbor Delphine Reese.  Miss Delphine is a lovely lady with red hair and sparkly clothes.  She has moved back to Freedom to take care of her sick father.  She has a way of finding good in everyone and always makes Bird feel good about herself.   Bird has met a new boy at school and decides she wants to be his friend.  She know just how Harlem feels when kids make fun and throw food at him. The school spelling bee is a chance for Bird to realize all of her goals.  She asks Harlem to be her partner to help her win fame and glory and the big prize, a trip to Disney World.   You can understand how Bird feels when "thinking about how the whole world was all filled up with wanting and not one little ounce of getting."   Barbara O'Connor writes about the usual teen problems.    I would recommemd this book to middle schoolers because of the similarity in the problems they face growing up.  Young females will especially relate to the self-esteem issues that Bird experiences.  O'Connor's clever humor keeps you laughing instead of feeling bad for the young teens 
 Excellent book!  My kids, 6 and 4, both love to read this before bed.  And the stickers that came with the book were a big hit.  My oldest has had some separation anxiety and the kissing hand has helped him realize that we are always with him.  
 Clippers are the best I ever had. They are very quiet, so they don,t scar our dog. They cut through our Goldens hair with ease. I would highly recommend these 
 My wife and I have used this a few times now and really like it.  From a novice's point of view, this is a great meditation aid.  I like being able to get the visual feedback as I calm and center myself.  I guess the hardest part is not letting myself get too anxious as I try to accomplish the task in front of me.    It's also a very pretty game with very lush and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack 
 This is an imaginatively detailed novel that is thoughtful, witty and bracing in a way that many good books are not. I suppose an oddity of "Independence Day" is that there is very little action, or even movement for that matter. What it is, though, is philosophical, wry, observant and smartly written. Ford's main character is a stable and intelligent divorcï¿½ who has such a curiously tight reign on his emotions that he, admittedly, finds himself in a stale but happy midlife. The novel is not so much about him blossoming out of this condition, but rather about his coming to a full understanding of it. If it is overwritten in parts, that is to some stylistic end that the author certainly seems to have in mind. 
  The great thing about this book is that it compels managers to do the things that they know are right, but aren't willing to take the time. Our companies don't reward us for managing, but this is precisely what helps people to perform. The reason this book is so great is that Blanchard has a wonderful knack for succinctly putting into focus a manager's need to put his or her people first. That makes this book invaluable and a worthy read. 
 The book is very informative for someone that is unfamiliar with the Balkans. The only mixed feeling I got from this book that I didn't quite get the position of the author. When I finished reading the book, I had one question in my mind, was Stacy Sullivan thinking that braking the law in unjustifiable even in the face of murder? Time has shown in the previous wars the barbarism of the Serbian army. The time has also shown the tolerance of the Albanian people as a nation.   Over 200,000 Bosnians were musdered by the Serbian army, and 10,000 Albanians. Over 1.5 million Albanians were forced to leave their homes. Their homes were burned, their people were raped, shot, burned alive, crossified, including children, women, and old people. What the Serbians were doing in Kosovo was unacceptable by any standards.  The only choice for them who had lost everything was to fight for the land that was passed on for milleniums from our ancestors.  If the authors house was burned, with her family inside, and the very same thing happened to most of people that she new, I am absolutely positive that she would try in anyway posible to destroy them who destroyed the lives of her loved ones. Anyone would do the same thing in their situation.   I agree that crimes of war have occurred from the Albanian side, but it must be understood that 10 or 100 or 1,000 Albanian racist do not represent the nation. A murderer is a murderer, whether he is Albanian, Greek, Serbian, Bulgarian, French, Russian or American. Albanians guilty of war crimes must be charged and punished for their actions, but please do not punish the whole nation of Kosovo.   What about the Serbian people, are they guilty. At some extent, yes; THEY NEVER PROTESTED TO THEIR GOVERMENT TO STOP THE ETHNIC CLEANSING. It is everyones duty as human beings to protect life, justice, and help the neighbor. Well Serbians saw the crimes being comitted and dind't even care.   What about Albanian tolerance? They have proven their tolerance as people thru the years.  In 1943, in the Republic of Albania(not Kosovo), 40,000 Italian soldiers took refuge in the Albanian homes after Musolini's excecution. They came there as invadors, they were not welcome, they comitted crimes, yet the Albanians opened their doors for those who were innocent.  In the Republic of Albania there are Serbian, Macedonian, and Greek minorities, and I can proudly say that discriminations do not exist. Greeks just like Serbians, have murdered Albanians for centuries, and yet in Albania, Greeks are not discriminated.  Let the people of Kosovo continue to live where they have been doing so for the past 3,000 years. We are the oldest people of the Balkan, direct ancestors of Illyrians, the true owners of that land.  As for Serbs, I respect their right to live there where they have lived since 900 AD when their barbarian ancestors reached Kosovo. They have their own heritage is Kosovo, and we have ours. We were there first, always majority, and never gave it up; this must be accepted by all Serbians.      LET THE RESIDENDS OF KOSOVO DECIDE THEIR FUTURE WITH THEIR OWN FREE VOTE IN A REFERENDUM.     I also wanted to thank the U.S. for putting in risk the lives of their own solders to defend the innocent children of Kosovo. Their effort was priceless, and will always be remembered and appreciated, beacuse of the lives they saved.

 A young man stumbles through the entrance to a mysterious castle now owned by his cousin. Both are hiding baggage from a cloudy past, a childhood ordeal that once threatened to overwhelm them. Amongst the broken and collapsed cluster of castle buildings, the relationship becomes strained when Danny King arrives at a sinister medieval castle in Eastern Europe where he has been given the offer of helping his cousin Howie renovate it into a luxury retreat.   Burdened with his mistakes of long ago and seeking to escape the randomness and chaos of New York, Danny becomes frustrated by this strange and inscrutable place, with its rock walls, ruined rooms, claustrophobic underground passage ways, and a mysterious round swimming pool, it's water black and thick with scum, stinking with something from deep inside the earth.  Whilst the castle seems to be conspiring to drag the young Danny down, the sights and sounds, and even the smells of the place seem to excite and thrill Howard, it's as though he just can't get enough of it.  Whilst Howard, and his wife Ann and young son, are thrilled with the delights of the castle, Danny continues to be haunted by his memories of how he tricked Howie and left him for dead in a cave when they were kids; it was a terrible error in judgment, which he is unable to forget.   Determined to stay connected to the outside world, Danny brings along a portable satellite in order to link to "his 304 instant messaging surnames and a buddy list of 180," along with his girlfriend. As he tries to feel "connected to his connectedness," nothing can assuage the feeling that Danny is miserable. With the sinister atmosphere of the castle encompassing him, he decides he wants to get away.   But it is the Keep, the mysterious tower that ultimately seduces Danny. Here he meets with an enigmatic woman called the Baroness " an ancient hag who looks more dead than alive" who clams that the castle and all the land around it in every direction is hers. She despises Americans, calling them mongrels and resents the intrusion by Howard into her solace. When Danny finally meets her, sees a ghost who turns into a young girl with long blond hair.   What exactly is the Keep? Howard isn't allowed near the tower because the Baroness has threatened him. But is the Keep something more metaphysical, a path perhaps to Danny's own inner-keep, his tortured soul? Plagued by the sudden visions he has by the pool, a scene of a boy and girl, Danny determines that the inside his head that will blow a whole right through the middle of Howard's life.   Forbiddingly atmospheric and steeped in secrecy, the Baroness calls to Danny, but is she just a part of a dream? Only later, when Howard, Danny and the rest of the renovators are trapped in the underground tunnels, facing the torture chamber below the Keep, are the cousins under pressure able to come to terms and bring closure on their past.   As author Jennifer Egan layers her maze-like plot, the narrative shifts to a man called Ray incarcerated for murder in a maximum-security prison taking a creative writing course, and careful to make sure that a manuscript he has written stays in safekeeping. He's got a crush on his teacher Holly, an ex-meth addict who is struggling to keep it together, she doesn't want him to see that she's vulnerable and overwhelmed pure sadness - a sadness mixed up with guilt, responsibility and loss.  The Keep is part modern gothic novel, and part disturbing suspense thriller and also part morality play where reality spins out of control and where imagination is intermingled with tunnels and dungeons and torture chambers with skeletons. It is wise not take any of the characters at face value, but they are certainly all tortured and are even ordained to collide, their futures hopelessly intertwined. It is to Egan's talent as a writer that she can so thoroughly convince us of their fears in a world that is almost dreamlike in its intensity. Mike Leonard September 06.

 Reeves provides a probing analysis of the Kennedy presidency that challenges the warm and fuzzy imagery often associated with "Camelot."  Reeves, an academic historian, has written a serious book that may turn off some casual readers. Yet this is the best analysis of John F. Kennedy's character and leadership style 
 I thought the book was well written and told the truth. Being a fan of the ABB for over 30 yrs I found out much that I did not know! This book, in my opinion, should be read by all ABB fans! I enjoyed the book 
  i enjoyed reading this book. it was funny, emotional, educational and entertaining at the same time. i liked how it was not just one main topic of the book, there were many different stories from all different aspects of careers in the health field. it was this story called "women in the military" that was very informative to me because eventually i want to be a registered nurse in the United States Navy. 
 I think everyone should read the book So You Want to be a Wizard. It's a book about a girl named Nita who is being bullied and runs into a library and finds a book called So You Want to be a Wizard. It's a great fantasy story; it has a dragon that adds a twist to it. I would recommend this book to any Harry Potter fans. This book is a great magical book. Nita and Kit use their manuals and cast spells. This is an awesome book if you believe in magic. This is an awesome adventurous book. If you like books where kids end up somewhere and get into trouble and have to find their way home, well this is the book you need to read. Last, this book is nothing but suspense. So many unpredictable events occurred I was amazed. But all I have to say is if you believe that wizardry, magic, and fantasy books are for you then you will like this book. This reminds me of another series, which I have read I thought was awesome, was The Keepers. So that's a series close to this but very interesting book to read. So You Want to be a Wizard is a very exciting book, so enjoy yourself and read this book 
 Purchased this for my Grandson who is 4 months old.  He has watched it three times and is very fascinated with it even though the theme is too advanced for him.  However, it will become a great learning tool in the near future.  Sesame Street is the greatest 
 I got a top tier MBA, spent tens of thousands of dollars and two years, but didn't learn the important stuff.  (And I was the valedictorian, and got some really great jobs).  I really enjoyed Greene's book 42 laws of power (I can't remember if it's 42 or some other number), but this book is a great reminder and educator of the way things work behind the scenes, in people's minds, and at the macro level of every business and political dealing.  I'm convinced that there is either a conspiracy in our educational system to make us dumb workerbees, 99% of our teachers just don't get it, or our measurement system for the quality and effectiveness of our eductional system is severely broken.  (Or all the above!)  Much of the book rings a bell with my intuition, but there is a great deal which is so inciteful and informative.  I would say I couldn't put the book down, but that's not true, I needed to take a rest every chapter or so.  I love his mixing of explaning the principals then giving historical examples.  The war stories have direct analogies to the business world.  I have also read Greene's "Art of Seduction", which I think is absolutely vile and disgusting.  I don't think the book is vile and distigusting, I think the book simply tells the truth.  Greene doesn't make the rules, he's just telling how many "successfull" people play the game, which is really just a clear illustration of the part of human nature which is cloaked behind good manners and grooming, and how people take advantage of our good nature, weaknesses, and need for connection and love--all of which applies to both our personal and business world.  Better to know it than not know it, and know when to fight fire with fire if you think you can stay true to your principles.  Maybe there should be a followup something like "Buddah's dance with Devil"  This book is going on my top shelf 
 If you miss Klaus Janson's inking on Frank Miller's sequel look no futher to see his work. I have been a fan of his work since 1974. This book shows you everything you need to know about being a comic book penciler. Everything from layout to placment and composition.  I hope there is a sequel.  I hope that Klas has many more volumes to follow this one.  It always wanted to take a course in comic book penciling and this one has it all 
 the second book of Hobb's trilogy did not loose any steam at all. The story continues with Fitz and his adventures as an asssasin for the farseer throne.While reading this book make sure to grab some tissues, alot of emotional stuff going on. This book centered alot on Fitz and Molly,which was great for the romantic aspect of this saga. In addition the ending of the book, for lack of a better word was explosive. Your heart will start beating faster and faster, with each turning of the page. If you loved the first book, you'll treasure the second book just as much and maybe more. highly recommended 
  This film is barly a science fiction film, it's more of a hodge podge of fantasy, old monster movies and fairy tales with many dream and surreal sequances.. City of Lost Children is more like the Wizard of Oz than like the Matrix, but is still dipped in enough science fiction jucies to suit my tastes. The plot revolves around a mad scientist, Krank (Daniel Emilfork), who lives off the coast of a surreal Dickensian French city in an old oil rig.   Krank does not have the ability to dream, and as a result he is prematurely old. In order to supplement his dream deficit, Krank kidnaps young children in order to study and extract their dreams. Unfortunately for Krank this is a self-fulfilling curse, as the experience of being kidnapped is so traumatic that the children have only nightmares. In pursuit of this scheme, Krank employs a sinister cult of blind men called "Cyclops" to perform the kidnappings.   In return for giving up their sight, the cult's neophytes are given a mechanical "third eye" and a device which makes their hearing unnaturally sensitive. This augmentation is as much a curse as it is a boon; at one point the audience may witness the discomfort of one Cyclops listening to Denree chomp his food. It is revealed that Krank is an artificially created man with superior intelligence. He was created by an inventor who also created six clones, a wife for himself (who later betrayed him), and a migraine-ridden brain in a jar named Irvin for him to interact with. Irvin's voice is supplied by Jean-Louis Trintignant; the Inventor and his clones are all played by Dominique Pinon.  The events of the film open with a sideshow strongman named One (Ron Perlman of hellboy fame) witnessing an orphan he cares for, named Denree (Joseph Lucien), being kidnapped by Krank's Cyclops. It later turns out that Denree is a special child, one able to provide Krank with the ability to overcome his condition (due to the fact that Denree has no sense of fear). One sets out to find and rescue his "little brother", with help of a nine-year-old street urchin girl named Miette (Judith Vittet) who holds the screen like no other child actress that I've seen.  Also in the film are a pair of Siamese twins known as "The Octopus". They run a thieves' guild in which they train and force orphans (one of whom is Miette) to steal for them. Due to unforseen circumstances, One gets caught up in a the theft of a large safe (which only he can carry). The end result of which is the orphans' failure to completely empty the safe.   Annoyed with this failure and Miette's subsequent decision to run off with One (Miette is their best thief) the Octopus seeks to destroy them. To this end they attempt to secure help from their former sideshow employer, whose trained fleas can inject poison into a person's scalp, inducing the victim to commit acts of violence when the flea-master plays his barrel organ and his scenes are the best in the movie.   Directed by the french duo of Jeunet & Caro who also did the yummy canniable flick "Delicatessen" (Jeunet later did Alien Reserection and the french film "Amelie") The story telling is wonderful the direction is flawless and the special effects are some of the best you could ever see in the mid 90's cinima. I don't know any one who has seen this film that doen't love it on some level. Yes, there are some confussing elements to it and takes some weird turns but this movie with all it's layers forces the movie goer to fill in the blanks and think outside the box to fully understand the complexites of this film...I've seen it a dozen times and I'm almost there! 
 I have read and been a fan of J.D. Robb since I first opened one of her books. Several I have "read" as audiobooks and this one was as geat an experience as the others. The reading of the book was well done and the "voices" excellent. Really adds to your listening enjoyment. One of my favorite ways to take a car trip now is with a Robb audiobook.    
 About the Book: For those of you planning to buy something for a comic book fan, the "Marvel Essentials" series are black & white trade paper back (tpb) reprints of what are considered popular and/or important Marvel Comics.   They are printed on lightweight paper, and are designed to bring comics that may be hard to find back to new and old comic book fans.  This particular tpb reprints a series of 15 comics that were originally released in 1982, 21-years after the first Marvel comic (Fantastic Four #1).  Another (more detailed) version, called the "Deluxe Handbook" was released in the mid 1980s, and will be reprinted in a series of 3 tpbs this year.  The series covers the major people, places, and things that make up the first 20-years of the "shared" Marvel Universe where Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, etc. live.  The black & white reprint is designed to keep size and costs down.  Good Features: - Easy to store (book format) - Easy to read the text (the lettering is crisp and clear) - Easy to find information and flip around because entries are alphabetically arranged - Entire 15 comic run in one book - Detailed reference information w/ first appearance of people / places / things - Good artwork (even in black & white)  Common Complaints - Original comics can still be found for cheap - Color is important, and not present in this book - Information is dated - The more complete "Deluxe Handbook" tpb 3-book series will be released in 2006  General Thoughts: I actually own about 11 of the original 15 comics from this series.  It has taken me over 6-years to find them in cheap quarter bins at comic shows, but I know the color originals from this series are easy to find.  I plan on getting rid of my originals, because I never really found myself reading the originals.  I filed them away with the rest of my regular comic collection, which isn't really the point with this particular series.  However, since tpbs, like the Essentials series, easily can be carried on a bus or plane, I tend to really enjoy reading them while commuting and traveling.  And since this book is the ideal size for sitting on a proper bookshelf, I've found that unlike the originals, I'll pull it off the shelf when I'm curious about a comic person, place, or thing.    Do keep in might that the larger and more complete Deluxe Handbook will be released in 3 black & white volumes later in 2006.  I plan on purchasing that series as well, but some people might want to wait to only keep and read that series. 
 I would strongly suggest this series for anyone that has a taste for the classics. All four films are great to watch and the quality of the films is nice. 
 Madeleine L'Engle captured my heart when I first read "A Wrinkle in Time" as a child.  I read this to my children, they read it themselves, and are now reading it to their children.  We count this book as a favorite gift for friends, children and adult alike.   Meg, the twins and Charles Wallace hold a special place in our hearts.   Thank you, Madeleine L'Engle for sharing your brilliance with us 
 I'm a big fan of iWork and have always looked for new office apps that out-perform Microsoft's apps which have become so feature-rich that functionality has become akward.  I love Pages and the formatting features it provides.  I do more layout work than word processing so I'm real happy with the way Pages works for me.  Keynote is nice too.  I don't believe in lots of slide transitions and builds when making a presentation so a lot of the flash and panash that PowerPoint tries to interject is useless to me.  You have lots of capability with Keynote but its clean, simple interface and robust formatting and import capabilities really works for me.  Nice package to be sure!  I would love to see a spreadsheet tool incorporated into iWork that is cross functional moreso than with Excel 2004 for Mac.  I think that Appleworks is a great start but needs to be taken to the next level.  Perhaps capture the spreadsheet piece from OpenOffice and build into a component of iWork and call it "Tabular" or "Sheets".  (just a suggestion 
 The Enron story is so rewarding to read: the greedy evil bad guy comes crashing down in a heap at the end.  What could be more fulfilling that that?  This book, while scaring you at first with its heft, is a really great read.  It's written in a very easily and active style, and it plays up the suspense and sensationalism of the subject matter.  The characters are brought to life and the story unfolds dramatically and quickly.  I found my pulse quickening at various times in the story and despite it's length, I was fully engaged through the entire stor 
 Evidence is the key word in E IS FOR EVIDENCE, from evidence planted to implement another, to lost evidence, etc. Grafton likes E words because there are lots of them in here to accompany evidence: We have ex-lovers, evasions, enemies, exoneration and endings.  Wow, are you as confused as I was when reading the back of this book?? My advice is not to read the back and just jump right in to it! This is the book where we see that Kinsey Millhone is not a super woman action figure, but can go through the normal garbage that we all experience. Except with Kinsey it's on a much grander scale. E IS FOR EVIDENCE tells a little of Kinsey's background, that she's thirty-two and had been married twice and divorced twice, used to be a cop, doesn't have many close friends (except for Henry) and usually takes the case of the underdog.   Grafton delves more into the personality behind her heroine and lets the reader see more of the real Kinsey Millhone, but so as not to bore you, she also brings us closer to Henry and others with glimpses into their homes and lives.  Another winner for Grafton!  
 Students LOVE making their own books. I have used this activity in many of my Spanish classes - ages 4 all the way to 17 years (teenagers still like to color and make things of their own - I just have them add some original sentences of their own and expand on the story.)   It's a welcome change from sentence translation, drills, charades, conversation partners etc. Motivation is KEY in learning a second language, and this resource has been a WONDERFUL tool to peak my students' interest as well as help them stretch their abilities.  It even has them asking "why" questions on grammar points and word choices. I highly recommend it as a great supplement to any Spanish curriculum.

 Back in the 1960s, writer George Plimpton began "covering" a variety of sports through participating on/with pro teams/athletes and reporting on it through books, magazine articles and TV specials.  Perhaps his most famous was in the early 1960s when he was "signed" by the Detroit Lions as a 36-year-old rookie trying to make the club as a third-string quarterback. Plimpton - wearing jersey number 0 - practiced with the team for one month. His quarterbacking culminates with his appearance in a scrimmage where Plimpton calls a number of plays under game conditions.  The book leads the reader through the highs and lows of Plimpton as a player, along with great anecdotes on the teammates and coaches.  A reprint is slated for publication in September 2006. I hope the TV special on Plimpton's training camp and QB play gets dusted off during the upcoming NFL season. Anyone reading this inside that large campus in Bristol, Conn. 
 The Techniques of Judo by Takagaki and Sharp is a reprint of a very  comprehensive and well-written text first published in 1957.  It contains  some techniques seldom taught in modern practice, such as Ganseki Otoshi  and Yama Arashi, and it has extensive notes on counters and defenses. I am  a sixth degree, and my highly-prized first edition is well worn with years  of research.  The contest illustrations are breathtaking examples of  flawless technique, and the "flavor" of the book speaks volumes  about martial spirit and a style of Judo seldom seen in these days.  Harold  Sharp is well known for his work on another classic Judo text first  published in 1956 with Kiyoshi Kobayashi, entitled The Sport of Judo.   Together, they are an impresive compendium of martial information and Judo  history. I give the Techniques of Judo to my advanced students, so they  won't forget that Judo is a martial art, not just a game 
 Just like a computer is useless without the programing, the TIVo DVR is useless without the TIVo Service and your programing source. TIVo allows a person to save programs you might want to view and lets you view them when you want.   Negatives: Used with Dish Network requires a signal from the Dishnet control after its daily update and TIVo doesn't give this signal.    TIVo works with IR controlled Dish/cable boxes, and Dish Network has dual tuner box with one tuner IR and the other radio controlled, TIVo will only control the IR controlled tuner 
 Reissued as a paperback in August 2006, The Partner leads the reader on a roller-coaster of emotions in a fast-moving plot.  In what I consider John Grisham's best work, there really aren't too many heroes to be found in the manipulative world of the news media, politics, finance and law.   The story is pushed along through the retelling of facts through a variety of transcripts. It works, since none of the characters could be "trusted" to tell the truth to another individual. Simply, documents don't lie, people do.   Everyone has a price to sell out a colleague or loved one; but the person seemingly most manipulated turns out the winner in the end.        
 When I lived in Boston, some years ago when there was a Rosie's bakery in Harvard Square that was forever crowded, I used to pop in there to ogle at all the absolutely mouth-watering treats. Mind you, I couldn't eat a thing, being intolerant to wheat, but my goodness was the "window-shopping" a treat.  With the publication of this cookbook, now folks can truly enjoy their own heaven on earth in their own home. Thank you, Rosie! or I should really say Judy!  I can truly fully understand now why her bakery was always so very packed with customers. Besides of being easy to follow, full of helpfup tips and interesting anctedotes, these recipes are to die for. I've tried quite a few, and every single one is hands down without fail the most delicious, delectable, divine desserts I have ever made. You cannot go wrong with this cookbook if you are looking for delicious treats to bake. Besides of cookies and bars, she has recipes for cakes and pies, scrumptuous frostings.  (By now, you may be wondering how I can be eating and enjoying these various treats...  I substitute the wheat flour called for in the recipes with a rice flour mix + guar gum, which makes me even more appreciative that Judy has written this cookbook. Finally, I can have a taste of her goodies. 
 I first read "The Mind's I" in high school and regularly reread its various essays.  Even with a quarter-century of age, it hasn't lost any of its luster. Indeed, with advances in cognitive science and neuroscience giving more empirical underpinning to at least a few of the speculations in this book, its mental value has actually increased.  Although you may not agree with the philosphical angle of each essay, you won't be able to honestly disagree without having your own cognition and philosophical views deeply scratched and stimulated 
      One of the more inventive subgenres in Romance novels these days are those that include paranormal subjects. They can be either set in historical times, or in the here-and-now, with it seeming that the redemption of vampires and other supernatural beings having the greatest draw for readers of late. Authors ever since Mark Twain have been taking the theme of time-travel and running with it, but the use of time travel in the romance genre only really started to catch notice in the mid-1980's. Since then, there's been quite a few of them, most of them pretty bad, as far as I am concerned.  In By a Lady: Being the Adventures of an Enlightened American in Jane Austen's England , author Amanda Elyot uses the trick of moving between time as the method of moving her heroine to the early-nineteenth century and back again. CJ (short for Cassandra Jane) Welles is tempted by an amber pendant at a flea market and buys it on impulse. When she is cast in a very off-Broadway play as her literary heroine, Jane Austen, CJ is estasic. During a dress rehersal, she opens one of the doors on the set -- and finds herself in the English city of Bath in the year 1801.  At first CJ thinks it part of the sets, but when she takes an apple from a cart, she discovers that the prison system in Georgian England are all too real when she doesn't have the money to pay for that apple. Stuck without a lawyer, CJ finds herself in prison, and moves from the frying pan right into the fire when she is parolled into the care of a gentlewoman who hires only convicts to keep the costs down. But CJ sticks to it, and even manages to make a friend, a fellow servant by the name of Mary.  But rescue comes in the form of a visitor to the rather vile employer, and CJ finds herself suddenly whisked away into the high life of Regency society in the company of Lady Euphoria Dalrymple. But along with decent meals, fine clothes, and a far better standard of living, CJ is also having to contend with the strict etiquette of the time, the lack of indoor plumbing, and the fact that she's simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.  And there's love too, of course. The Earl of Darlington is very taken with our heroine, with her forthright ways, and he's not that bad in the good looks department either. When CJ also gets to meet her favorite author in the flesh, it's nearly enough to make CJ want to stay in her new time and place.  Poor CJ -- will she be able to sort out all of the society rules, fit in, and win the dashing, oh-so-delectable Earl for her very own?  Despite the problems -- the contrived setting, some very improbable scenarios including a gang rape in a brothel, an ending that requires complete suspension of disbelief (altho' the use of Yiddish is cute), and the fact that the heroine is a bit of a Mary-Sue. The use of quite a few anachronisms can be forgiven, and the research into the customs and entertainment of the times is very thorough and enjoyable. It was quite clear that the author was very much in love with the time period and subject matter and it is this that saved the novel for me. It's clear from the writing and the humor that the author was having a great time writing this novel, and it shows.  The writing and dialog are witty, the secondary characters in the form of Lady Euphoria and Jane Austen are well rounded and at times, more interesting than the leads, and the setting of Bath is rendered in a very visual style. It's an entertaining and enjoyable read, perfect for an evening's read when one is longing for a much more romantic time, or at least, when we thought things were more romantic.  Jane Austen fans will like this light-hearted romp in history, and it earned about three-and-a-half stars that were rounded up to four. It's not a perfect novel, but compared to a lot of the romance novels out there, it's certainly a cut above 
 The manga form of presentation makes reading about the prelude to this event easy and fast.  The book seemed to be reasonably accurate with historical documentation and the visual format allowed the author to include detail that might otherwise have become difficult to work into the story.  The clothing, clogs, air raid hoods, etc. that are be depicted add depth of information to a quick read 
 This is perhaps the best one volume treatment of the doctrine of God that I have ever encountered.  Torrance is a masterful theologian and this book particularly stands out as a luminous work amdist his many other writings.    Drawing deeply from patristic and contemporary sources, Torrance tackles all the major issues inherent in the doctrine of God.  Particularly important to Torrance are Irenaeus and Athansius.  Torrance's reading of these theologians and their contribution is extremely helpful espcially given that many trinitarian theologians are locked in debate over the respective contributions of the Cappadocians versus Augustine.  Torrance's return to Athansius and Irenaeus coupled with his nuanced analysis of Augustine and the Cappadocians offers a substantial corrective much of the discussion that centers around the controversy between the eastern and western doctrines of the Trinity.  Essentially, I see this book as really doing all the significant work that a book on the doctrine of the Triune God should.  Torrance takes a holistic approach to understanding the myster of God, looking at the biblical frame of reference from which the doctrine of the Trinity necessarily arises.  The central touchstone that he keeps coming back to is the argument that just as God is toward us in the economy of salvation so his inherently and antecedently in his own eternal being.  Thus, Torrance grounds his doctrine of God firmly in God's self-disclosure in Jesus and the Spirit.  What follows is everything a theology of the Trinity should be.  Torrance is frimly committed to allowing the concrete reality of Jesus revelation of God to determine and ground all accounts of the being of God.  Torrance's work exemplifies precisely how a Christian understanding of God should be articulated, grounding the discussion Christocentrically.  However, in so doing we are not left with some 'Jesusology' but rather a full-orbed dynamic trinitarianism that flows from the reality of Jesus' revelation of the Father and the sending of the Spirit.  Unlike so many other accounts of the Trinity, Torrance is able to be thorougly Christocentric and yet give a masterful account of the persons of the Spirit and the Father and the fullness of Trinitarian communion that is the Christian God.  Torrance excels at being conceptually erudite where so many others are conceptually muddy.  His solutions to the problems of the relation of the economic and immanent trinities, the filioque, the nature of trintiarian unity and the divine persons, the sovereignty of God and divine impassibility are so nuanced and well-informed that they simply have no peers.  In my opinion this book defines the starting point and basis for any theological discussion of doctrine of God.  Torrance has put together in one volume what so many other theologians have labored to accomplish in many.  Highly recommended 
 "Growing up in the small town of Common, New Mexico, Joel's life has progressed pretty much as any other handsome young man. His friendship with Tom, the new preacher's kid from Houston, begins to change things though. He doesn't understand some of the things he's feeling until a reckless drinking bout ends with a very public kiss from Tom--and things alternately begin to fall into place and fall apart. A moving tale of coming-out and coming to grips."-- zebra 
 Someone once told me, "If you want to know how to do something right, learn from the best."  Well, here it is.  King has proven time and time again, year after year, novel after novel, that he's one of the best at his craft.  And in _On Writing_ he shares what he's learned over the years.  King's writing and teaching style is so fluid and natural I was drawn into this book as if it were one of his novels. Whether you're a novice writer just delving into the world of fiction writing or an experienced novelist, there's something to be learned from someone who's travelled the road.  I read the book through once but have gone back to it time and time again since then.  It's a book every writer should have on his/her bookshelf. 
 I recommend -- five stars up, "Lincoln's Assassins: Their Trial & Execution." For this genre, Swanson & Weinberg have set a new standard of excellence.  It is about events that occurred after the assassination and burial of President Abraham Lincoln.  While the plot may be morbid for some - nonetheless,  it is enticing for anyone searching for truth, justice, and a good-old-fashion read.   The writing is vividly done, the photographs are mesmerizing,  and the documentary evidence: overwhelming in presentation and abundance.  Those who study numerology might find it interesting that James Swanson and President Lincoln were born on the same day. Like many successful entrepreneurs, Mr. Swanson discovered at an early age, his passion in life.  He started collecting artifacts about President Lincoln when he was ten years old.  Since becoming an investor in many companies, I know the importance of mergers, compatibility, and symbiotic relationships. Consequently, it was amusing to discover Daniel Weinberg has been the owner of a book store for more than thirty years that specialized in books dealing with President Lincoln.  Even though the events took place more than one hundred thirty years ago, the authors have compiled evidence and supporting materials in a way I could still feel the suspense, drama, and intrigue that was evidently experienced by those living during this historical period.   Napoleon Bonaparte once said:  "A picture is worth a thousand words."  If you accept this premise, you will love this book as there are scores of photographs (along with eloquently done text) that help the reader form a compelling, and coherent analysis of events that transpired more than one hundred thirty years ago.  Chapter four is the beginning of the conspiracy trial, which was unprecedented in so many ways. Presided over by President Andrew Johnson - it was initially going to be conducted in secret. At the last moment, compromises were made to allow selected people to attend.    The book reads like an episode of "24 (the television hit). Each page is tantalizing, breathtaking, and thought-provoking. One of the eight facing execution was Mary Surratt. The human drama, suspense, and turmoil involving her part in the plot, kept me riveted, intrigued, and captivated.  The book is exceptional and has my highest recommendation.  Reginald V. Johnson, author, "How To Be Happy, Successful, And Rich"    
 IF YOU LOVE THE OTHER DIARIES YOU WILL ENJOY READING ABOUT HER FINAL DAYS. I ENJOYED ALL OF THE OTHER DIARIES BUT THIS ONE IS THE SADDEST. SHE HAS HER GOOD DAYS AND BAD, BUT SADLY SHE STOPPED WRITING IN THE LAST YEARS WHEN LIFE BECAME SO UNBEARABLE THAT SHE COUDLN'T EVEN WRITE ABOUT IT SO THIS DIARY IS INCOMPLETE. YOU WILL LOVE SEEING INSIDE THE LIFE AND MIND OF AN AUTHOR  WHO ACHIEVED SUCCESS IN HER OWN LIFETIME AND LIVED TO WRITE ABOUT HER PERSONAL LIFE FROM CHILDHOOD TO HER LAST DAYS. THIS DIARY IS HER LAST, BUT LUCY MAUD MONTGOMERY WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE ON IN HER WRITINGS. HER DIARY WAS A WAY TO SHARE HER INNERMOST THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS THAT SHE COULDN'T SHARE IN HER NOVELS. YOU TOO WILL FEEL LIKE A KINDRED SPIRIT 
 Without a doubt, Mr Eckes has hit on the irony of our technical culture. Balance is what it is all about. Any change effort, be it, Six Sigma or other, is only as effective as the people implementing and impacted by the change. Bravo Mr Eckes, you have provided the reader with a roadmap for sustainable results 
 Simple Abundance is the BEST kind of meditation book - for each day has a lengthy enough message that everyone can find something therein - a positive - to focus on during that day.  This one was a gift I gave to my daughter...and I recommend it to all 
 This and the Hipster Handbook (and their mother, The Official Preppy Handbook) are not only hilarious, but important books. For every joke, there is a grain of truth. You have to wonder which characteristics were genuinely observed in these people, and which are made up. But when you start seeing people you know flawlessly described in the book, and it's happened to me a lot with this book, it's apparent that it really is telling the truth. This cataloguing of traits is a great thing, because years from now, when that small subset of people called Soccer Lillies or Leiberals is gone, there will still be this record of them 
 I can't say enough good things about this book. I bought it around Valentine's Day, right around the time that my boyfriend and I broke up (of course! I never seem to have a boyfriend on that holiday!).   At the time, I was thinking about having casual sex with a friend of mine, just to get me over the breakup. After reading this book and taking some of the advice to heart, I realized that it probably wouldn't be a good idea for me to act on my impulse to go for it with my friend. That's not to say that other people shouldn't have a "friends with benefits" type of relationship, I just realized in reading this book that it probably would't be right for me and that I should put some thought into it before just going for it.  BUT, I also realized that at a certain point, casual sex might be right for me and that it could be a great thing to do if I met the right guy, found the right situation. Well, I just had the right situation come up, and I feel really good about it! Since the guy was someone I wouldn't really want to get serious with, I feel really great about it -- we had fun, but that's all it was. If I hadn't had this book, I'm not sure how I would be feeling, but this book really helped me figure out how to know when the timing is right and when it's not. When it IS right, having a one-night stand can be a nice way to have some fun while you're waiting for Mr. Right to come along.  There's a lot of other great info in the book too and lots of stories from women that remind me of situations I might have been in myself at one point or another. It's nice to know that I'm not the only one going through all these things. I learned a lot from reading the stories from other women in this book.  It's all just really good info and a fun read 
 I pre-ordered the book and was anxiously (and impatiently) awaiting its release.  It was delivered about a week ago and after reading the first few chapters, I knew it was clearly worth the wait.  Not only is it an easy read, but it has already sparked more ideas that I ever would have imagined (or could manage this year) on how to engage our clients in a relevant and meaningful way.  The tools that John and Tamara have included in this book will help spark the creativity you need to develop innovative new ways to improve the overall customer experience. 
 HA!  Great movie, plot, performances and insights!  Gotta see this one, at least once, for experiencing a truly under-rated masterpiece.  My main reason for writing is the inane comments here and fear with reality that pervades our society.  Those who can't, don't or won't appreciate (at least) the marvelous, insightful messages here are possibly the very ones that assure nothing will ever change much .  Scary to shed light on bare essence of humanity's inhumanity and its inability to rise above the systematic base obsessions of power, control and coveting; whether rationalized with all the reasons that endorse continuing to man's lower instincts or from fear of looking beyond the security of ignorance.  It is amazing that the natural order of things may be better balanced and have a wisdom beyond anything man may attain, as he seeks to control nature and fellow man while failing miserably at controlling himself, even with all his knowledge and tech, to a point equal or beyond the inherent natural wisdom of (so called)lower species.   Have some fun and enjoy this movie.  It is powerful and as perfect as it gets in addressing very intriguing human societal conundrums while offering quality performances from a great cast on numerous levels.  As a species, we have come so far and grown so little! This movie will make you (oh-oh) think and feel about subliminal and covert topics o human nature that are rarely put well in words or illustrated in today's world. 
 No doubt this is a good book, but be warned that it takes up to about a third of the book to really get going.  The initial part of the story is a bit annoying and quite 'whiney' in tone as the protagonist grows up and feels terribly alone and misunderstood, as she can perceive the spiritual realm, when no one else can.  Some judicious editing wouldn't have gone astray here.  It could have been condensed to about three chapters.  The middle part of the book deals with the protagonist completely relocating through time and space to suddenly find herself in her previous incarnation of, you guessed it, the queen of Egypt. (Why anyone is never the person who cleaned up the crap after the camel in a previous life, is beyond me.)  That being said, this is where the book does get interesting as the protagonist is slowly introduced to spiritual teachings about the nature of the world, including pairs of opposites, sacred geometry, astrology etc.  The information provided is thought provoking and interesting but nothing you haven't really heard before if you've studied Hermetic Philosophy.  Still, pretty good though.  The description of the kind of Astral visions in the sarcophagus are really interesting, especially the ancient archetypal idea of searching for your opposite to complete you, in the Jungian Animus/Anima kind of way.  Also the confrontation with the evil shadow is provocatively described.  The last third of the book is still interesting and is a return back into the 'Present' where the protagonist is recognising all the characters in her life as reincarnations of the same mob she hung around with in Egypt all those years ago.  (Are we really destined to spend eternity evolving with the same group of people?) I dunno, but you'd think you'd have more chance of challenging your ego boundaries if you met a wide variety of people who cahllenged you in different ways.  Still, all in all, a worthwhile book.  I'm not sure that you could call it literature in the true novel, sense of the word.  One wonders why a story had to be fabricated and this information couldn't just be presented in a straight forward informative way.  Still worth getting though 
 My daughter immediately stops crying when we play the CD or DVD.  It is such a life saver for us because we can put her in her swing, take showers, or get other household chores done.  We discovered it when she was 7 months, and it still works like a charm (she is now almost 9 months).  Plus the songs are wonderful! The CD works better for us because it's non stop singing.  When we play the DVD she cries when the characters stop singing, unless we are sitting with her 
    This is a good book for those of us who remember only slightly the history of the American Revolution from high school or college.  It's highly readable, informative and, if you're an American, even inspirational.  It's history that has been made enjoyable to read 
 If you live in the U.S.A., this will become one of your reference books, no matter if you are hispanic or not 
 I really felt I *must* read this book as Hayek is required reading for those who know that any form of collectivism (socialism, communism, you name the variety) is a bad thing. It takes more than a shallow understanding of the overall picture to see this, which is why so many are clamoring for socialized medicine. (Though, of course, they'd never call it that.)  The reason I only give Hayek 4 stars is because he's just plain tough to read. He's wordy, long-winded, and uses entirely too many 75-word sentences. His is one of the few books that when I turned the final page I thought: "I'm so glad THAT is over!"  Make no mistake - this is good stuff - but it could have been written in a much less complicated and convoluted manner. I really think that the "Reader's Digest" version may be a viable alternative.   I consider myself an accomplished reader, but this book was pushing my limits. It really isn't a terribly difficult to understand subject, Hayek just makes it that way.  As I say - good stuff. Fans of classic political and social theory will want to slog through this book. For those of us just as interested but not as fanatic, check out the other suggestions for alternatives to this book

  In 1938, James Cagney returned to Warner Brothers, having broken his contract a year earlier and made 2 independent productions which had only limited success. This script was to be his third production but he sold it to Warners who had the production unit to guarantee a  box office hit.  Some of the elements were copied from other films of the period such as the inclusion of the repulsive Dead End Kids who had just scored success in Goldwyn's film "Dead End" and a story using the same premise as MGM's smash hit "San Francisco".  Cagney and Pat O'Brien play 2 childhood friends, young hoodlums raised in poverty, who take different paths in life.  Cagney is hardened  through reform school and prison to become a vicious hood and O'Brien, who escapes conviction in his youth, becomes a priest.  The film traces their relationship culminating in Cagney's sentence to death at the electric chair.  Along the way, he has become a hero to the Dead End Kids much to the chagrin of the pious O'Brien. The memorable ending of the film is ambiguous, leaving the viewer to decide whether Cagney dies a hero or a coward.  Ann Sheridan is on hand too as Cagney's girlfriend but her role shows evidence of editing.  She is young, brittle and tender.  Cagney won the New York Critics Award in 1938 for this great performance and he dominates the film.  O'Brien's priest is not a fully rounded character and Cagney's energy and electricity wipe him away.  Bogart is on hand too as a cowardly crooked lawyer and he looks great.    Michael Curtiz directs the film with his usual versatility  balancing all the elements of action, drama and sentiment with great skill and racing from one scene to the next without pause for breath.  There are some excellent sets and the lighting is particularly impressive, as preserved in the excellent print. Curtiz was a master crafstman.  The DVD comes with a generous list of interesting extras.  There is a worthwhile featurette on the film and its stars and a very verbose  commentary.  The commentator had access to the film's production notes so there is information which would be unavailable to the general public otherwise.  Unfortunately, he does not draw breath and repeats himself, so it all becomes very tedious.  The cartoon has Daffy Duck behaving as his name implies and different to the cynical observer he later became in the fifties.  A technicolour musical short is on hand too with a good parody of Michael Curtiz, some pleasant dance routines and glimpses of the sets of the technicolour productions from Warner's 1938 films, including "The Adventures of Robin Hood". The Newsreel shows the signing of the Munich Peace Treaty, pregnant with historical significance and possibly one of the century's biggest shams.  Finally, there is a Lux Radio program of the film but personally, I find these of little interest, particularly with the condensed scripts.  Why listen to a transcript when you can watch the original?  These Warner's DVDs are great value and if the DVD is purchased as part of their Gangster Boxed Set, the value is even greater 
 I go to Anime expos alot. And to to be honest this sword aint half bad. Unlike its 67' brother its only 37' but its a whole lot better to wield. Combat Ready, Very Sturdy and made in CHINA. I notice some swords made in PAKISTAN! and they usually end up breaking so this swords worth the buy if your a bleach fan and if you wanna save some cash 
 This spirited, splendidly acted film personifies everything that was good about WWII movies made during WWII.  It's all here--heroism, ethnic diversity, caring, one-for-all/all-for-one, good guys, bad guys, no ambiguity.  ...It seems quite unsubtle today, but for its  genre, it's at or near the pinnacle shared with such other made-during-WWII  greats as "Gung Ho," "Wake Island," "Guadalcanal  Diary," "30 Seconds Over Tokyo," and "Bataan.&quot 
 Dame Elizabeth is a true star, the so called stars of today pale next to her. I didn't think there could be anything else to write on her. But Mr. Taraborrleei did find some interesting and new thing to read about the ever fascinating Taylor. As a long time fan I couldn't put the book down. I would lke to read a book on just her films and the peope who worked with her. There was pure magic looking up at that face, sometimes you forgot what a true great actress she was. Thank you, Randy.           Edmund Arredond

 I'm a small animal massage therapist but have not taken a course in Traditional Chinese Medicine yet. This book is very helpful for giving a good background for what seem to be complicated concepts and multiple ideas. Acu-Cat is written in simple terms with a well-organized format. For someone who did not have any training in bodywork, this might be a bit too much but still a good intro to TCM. I'm reading Acu-Cat along with Four Paws, Five Directions and find the former an excellent resource for the more detailed topics. Acu-Cat is a "must read" for every vet, vet tech, & massage therapist who did not have TCM in their basic curriculum 
 Do not even think about passively reading this book-use it!  It is filled with a wealth of tools that we all need to know about in order to live our lives at 100%.  Tony is an amazing coach unlike any other person that I have been exposed to.  This is a large book that is well worth the effort.  "Awaken The Giant Within" will no doubt sit among "Think And Grow Rich" as a classic in the personal development field.  If you haven't already been exposed to it you are in for a treat.  
 The Aviation Century series concludes with this fifth, final volume in a series that explores aviation after World War II. Archival and original images of planes accompanies facts and historical events in the aviation world, with chapter considering how military aviation translated to civilian life, flight safety issues, and possible future changes. Libraries with the other volumes must have this concluding chapter, while military libraries will find it a solid stand-alone survey.  Diane C. Donovan California Bookwatc 
 As a fifth grade teacher, I have been searching for a good historical fiction novel about the Revolutionary War -- one on an easier reading level than Johnny Tremain.  This is my best find so far.  The teachers in my school share our one battered copy as a read-aloud.  Of course, it helps that our school is just down the road from the Brandywine Battlefield.  This local interest probably explains why we enjoy this book so much 
 I really enjoyed this book. It is current and real, unlike some idealistic religious readings. I would recommend it to anyone looking for some honesty and humor in spirituality 
 I don't know what this last comment was all about but I think the book was awesome.  I have never been able to find another book that even comes close to this book.    The book will not rebuild your transmission...if you think it will you are mistaken.  But if you are mechanical and you would like to try and build the trans yourself ...you would be mistaken if you didn't have this as a reference while you were doing it.  OR if you just wanted to know about the operation of the trans and how it is supposed to work ...this is the book  However if you are looking for a great reference on what and how to build a transmission this book is the way to go.  I had to buy the book for a friend when I was helping a friend with his car.  I didn't know much about these units and I thought the book was a great reference.  There are no other books of its kind available 
 This was an interesting book.  It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read.  The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era.  I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time.  I plan on reading several other works by this author.  It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language.  I would recommend 
 This cookbook has plenty of beautiful pictures to capture the cook's interest.   Its strongest quality is the narrow focus on Southwestern cuisine--a welcome deviation from the ususal canned soup and chicken crock pot cookbooks.   There are many flavorful, restaurant quality recipes which are clear and easy to follow.  Many recipes in this book do not require browning of meat before adding it to the slow cooker.  This is a plus if you want a collection of recipes that involve dumping items in the crock before running off to work.  And if you host football parties and the like, some of these dishes would just be perfect for a manly, meat-loving crowd.   I would describe the recipes as flavorful and not overly spicy (though if you want to kick up the heat, you can do so).  I am able to make these dishes in a standard 4 quart crockpot.  A few of them I think you could make in the cute little 1 1/2quart crockpots.   The ingredients are not difficult to find in my grocery store.  I now keep canned habanaro chilies and green chilies in my pantry.  To the extent you are called upon to roast particular types of peppers, you can save prep time the next time around by roasting several peppers and freezing them.  I like to plate these dishes on large serving platters, spread out grandly with a salad and a few blue corn tortilla chips, just like a fine restaurant meal.  
 Members of traditional churches will not be swayed by this latest of Dr. Pearce's books and - as is evident from previous reviews - neither will certain MDs.   Speaking of the "fruits" in my headline:   Where are the fruits of billions of dollars spent on, say, cancer research, or heartdisease or SIDS deaths (10000+ annually)?   Certainly, many MDs are known by their fruits and 'intent' and deserve tremendous respect, but the field of medicine in general leaves a lot to be desired.     Anyone who followed Pearce's "intent" over the years, knows he is a man who takes his journey through life seriously and what's more, he is willing to SHARE his insights and his progress.   To us the readers, these insights come at an affordable price, can get enhanced with steady homework, something many other fields cannot lay claim to.   There, 'sharing' often means fleecing you of your money at devastating costs.     Thanks to authors like Pearce, Liedloff, Halfmoon and the producers of flicks like "What the Bleep do WE Know?", we have an opportunity to grow into the beings many of us are yearning to become, beings in control of their lives rather than the misguided ideas of others.   The "Industries" of Church, Medicine and Politics certainly don't want us to have control.     Life is meant to be a liberating event, not a suffering from anxiety, depression and disease.   Pearce is doing an incredible job, by making palatable ancient Eastern thought, aligning that with Western thought and modern science, thus lifting the serious seeker onto a higher plane.   I completely share his feelings about that liberating person Jesus, who is so sorely misrepresented by church.   Thanks Joe!   
 	This is the most comprehensive and up to date book I know of about sweatshops in the U.S. and worldwide.  It is must reading for anti-sweatshop activists and anyone else interested in this ugly seamy side of globalized capitalism.  	Ross endorses the U.S. Government Accounting Office's definition of a sweatshop as "a business that regularly violates both wage or child labor and safety or health laws."  Employing that definition, he concludes that there are about a quarter million sweatshop workers in the United States.  Many are immigrants in the apparel industry.  	He shows that sweatshops were rampant in the U.S. economy at the beginning of the twentieth century.  As a result of the 1937 Fair Labor Standards Act, they declined greatly from the 1940s to the 1970s.  But then a confluence of factors--including globalization and industrial deregulation--resulted in the resurgence of sweatshop employment in the 1980s that has continued to today.   	He blames the international expansion of sweatshops on deregulated global capitalism that has produced a competitive race to the bottom among low wage countries.  The last part of the book focus on the anti sweatshop movement and the development of effective labor standards. 
 This book was very good.From the first page it grabs you, and never lets go.It was very suspenseful, it got me guessing so many times, but I was always wrong.If you are looking to read a good suspenseful book this is IT 
 This is a moving story about the unbelievable pain and prejudice faced by the Japanese in America during WWII. It tells about the life experiences of Hiroko, a Japanese girl, who arrives in America right after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. It tells of her life detained in an internment camp and her life after she is released. It tells of her romance and losses. The story is fictional, but could be real... The historical backdrop is convincing and very realistic. It reveals many of the injustices imposed on the Japanese during this time. A powerful and thought-provoking novel 
 This is my ALL TIME favorite record.  Where have all the good musicians gone?  They just do not make them like this anymore.  Highly recommended, very enjoyable tunes 
 I just finished several "stone blocks" in my dining room, and I am almost embarrassed to say that I literally squealed with delight at how easy it was and how good it turned out!  And I'm not a novice painter; I'm  a NON-painter. Roberta Gordon-Smith is one of those gifted people who can  teach her subject to anyone...truly.  Thank you SO much = 
 I had no idea after reading some pretty depressing developing country scenarios in  "Development as Freedom" last year, that they would affect my country (Kenya) so powerfully. Famine, one of those degrading human disasters, once again stalks my country to the extent that the President had to appeal for international food aid,how regrettable after 40 years of so-called independence. As the author candidly points out, famine doesn't occur in countries where citizens have consistent income streams because even if rains fail, food can be imported and purchased. But as usual, in our case, the weather, rather than lack of leadership in economically empowering Kenyans(for instance through food-for-work programmes) was blamed for the famine. Condorcet, a French mathematician, is quoted in the book as saying ..."If they have a duty towards those who are not yet born, that duty is not to give them existence, but to give them happiness." I would recommend the book to the next occupant of State House and his (or her) administration, because the current administration is too busy figuring out how to contain Raila Odinga rather than efficiently running the country.  PS. I'm aware that "Development as Freedom" is more than just about famine, but I'm too 'hungry' to outline the rest of his ideas,I beg your pardon. 
 Sonny Rollins, one of the most influential tenor saxophonists in the history of jazz. His deep tone, influenced by Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster. Sonny Rollins is my favorite tenor saxophonist.   Sonny is a very unique musician. Some of his ideas are very experimental, but his overall message, just swing! In this interesting format, tenor sax-bass-drums, Sonny shows his stuff, and plays his heart out.  In jazz, tenor sax trios are fairly rare. Here, Ray Brown on bass and Shelly Manne on drums help Sonny out by delivering this swinging session.  Obviously, the theme of this album was westerns. The old western standard I'm an Old Cowhand, is done here by Newk and the gang. Rollins' original Wagon Wheels is very catchy.   Sonny Rollins had some great albums in his career, and this one should be considered to be among the best.

 This book touches on many of the important blues styles and describes how the music evolved into its current state from the many roots to the many styles that are still alive today.  This is a serious reference, packed with all kinds of useful information and hundreds of rare pictures for any serious blues enthusiast 
 In her book, They Saw the Elephant: Women in the California Gold Rush, Jo Ann Levy weaves letters and journal entries into a picture of the lives of women during the California gold rush.  Coming by covered wagons or ships these women wrote about their journeys' across mountains, deserts, oceans, and jungles. The excitement of an adventure and the beauty of the land was not the whole story however; misery and death joined them on their journey. Inadequate provisions, brutal storms and sickness were common themes. And once these women reached the promise land of San Francisco, the streets were not paved in gold as they dreamed, but littered with trash.  The belief that there were only prostitutes or actresses was also not true; many women ran boarding houses or mined for gold.  Some left after the gold ran out, but many women stayed in the cities that they helped create.  Though this book it is not organized in to one story, it is an insight into the women who came to California during the gold rush. You will be amazed by their bravery as they left their comfortable lives and uprooted their families for adventures unknown. 
 I really enjoyed this installment of the series.   While Cissy can be overbearing and get on your nerves, her character, as well as Andy's, are very well-developed and realistic. While this story was fairly predictable and easy to figure out, it was still enjoyable 
 Making the transition to raw foods is not always easy since most marketing of foods is geared to eating cooked, processed and packaged foods. Eating raw foods requires a whole new approach to eating and life. This book helps make the transition easier.  There are more good raw food books out there than ever before, but Raw in Ten Minutes is distinct in that the recipes truly are easy and quick to make, without the use of dehydrators. Many of the dishes taste and look as if they took a lot of time to make.  While there is some enthusiastic introductory information in this book, there is not a lot of technical explanation which is, however, available in other raw food books concerning the benefits of eating raw foods, nutritional values, combining flavors and categories of foods, etc. Bryan Au gets straight to recipes that are a sensual feast to see and taste.   One of the first recipes I tried was the Carrot Ginger Soup made with a light miso, which probably takes less than ten minutes to make. Even my children loved this and they are not quick to make the transition to raw food eating. The Spanish Lasagna tastes wonderful, and like all the other recipes is easy to make.  If you don't have too much time but appreciate gourmet meals this is a good book to have around along with the other wonderful raw food books out there.   I also recommend and have used extensively David Wolfe's Sunfood Diet (also with easy recipes); Kenney and Melngailis' Raw Food, Real World  (beautiful presentation and perfected recipes); Underkoffler's Living Cuisine, (good information and delicious recipes) Juliano's Raw: The Uncook Book (fantastic, but more complicated recipes); and a wonderful book of mostly easy recipes which I still have from the 1970's by Marcia Madhuri Acciardo called Light Eating for Survival.

 No, this isn't Thackery's original classic, but a screenplay of his novel, packed with 140 color photos, original costume designs, and examples from other movies and photos which served as inspiration for the film. As much for film production students as for Thackery scholars, Vanity Fair covers the mechanics of translating a classic novel to the screen.

 Economists are turning their focus of inquiry to subjects that were once the exclusive preserve of their colleagues in other social sciences--history, sociology, and political science. The title of this book, "Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy," appears to have been deliberately, even provocatively, chosen for contrast with its famous predecessor, "Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy," by the sociologist Barrington Moore. It is as if the economists are saying, "You've had your go. It is now our turn."  One thing follows when economists have a go: Occam's razor is wielded ruthlessly. Occam's razor is the principle associated with a medieval Franciscan monk, William of Ockham, which extols simplicity over complexity: in his words, "plurality should not be posited without necessity." This has, over time, become an important principle in distinguishing good from less-good science, useful from less-useful descriptions of reality.   Acemoglu and Robinson take this cut-the-chaff exhortation to heart. A few simple and sharp answers are provided even for the complex and difficult questions that are at the heart of the book: why and how does democracy arise? Why and how does democracy take root in some places at some times, while making only cameo appearances in others?   Acemoglu and Robinson daringly reduce the determinants of democratization to three or perhaps four: the level of inequality in society; the structure of the economy (i.e. whether it is predominantly agrarian or otherwise); the kind of assets owned by the elites; and the extent of globalization.    It is remarkable how many historical experiences-in Latin America, Europe, and Africa-- can be explained by the simple theory put forward by the authors. For example, Argentina's frequent lurching between various forms democracy and autocracy follow neatly from the high levels of inequality, which made the elites very resistant to democratization and the consequent redistribution of wealth away from them that political change would entail.  To be sure, the fit between theory and the historical experience is not perfect, and the authors are candid about this. Some of the cases that the book does not discuss-India's ability to maintain democracy in the face of overwhelming odds, for example--have traditionally defied easy explanation, even for political scientists. And there are surely cases where non-economic factors such as ideology, individuals (leaders), randomness, and unintended consequence, have had a significant role in determining the path of political development. For example, if Sir Sewoosagur Ramgoolam, Mauritius' first Prime Minister, had responded to the referendum before independence by entrenching the majority Hindus rather than assuaging the minority by guaranteeing minimal political participation for the latter, Mauritius might well have been like the archetypal, strife-ridden, ethnically divided African country rather than a durable democracy.   A quibble about the book's structure. While there are considerable rewards to reading the book, patience and deft maneuvering through the thicket of mathematics, are required to reap them. The authors could have demarcated more clearly the Greek from the English to allow the mathematically challenged to obtain the benefits in one continuous flow. That way, the book could have been more accessible to the curious generalist in addition to being a required reference for the specialist.  But these minor shortcomings are ultimately swamped by, and are perhaps even the unavoidable consequence of, the sheer ambitiousness of the effort: nothing less than to provide a simple and unified explanation of democracy. And here's the additional bonus, the theory can be taken to the data, and even falsified. So, the skeptics and the naysayers can have their go, and refute or validate. Either way, inquiry will be furthered and the stock of knowledge enriched. The most memorable rendition of Occam's razor is due to Einstein: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." The book certainly meets that standard.     
 I picked this book up on a whim while I was at the pharmacy. Not feeling great, I wanted some 'fluff' to read. I got anything but...I've never read a Jayne Ann Krentz book before but I'll definitely pick up some in the future. I learned quite a bit about lucid dreaming ~ and although I would be what Krentz would call a level 3 or 4, I'm definitely not a 5. Very interesting take on the whole thing. Not what I usually expect from this genre. Thank you for the adventure 
 After reading Craig Hall's excellent book, the most important thing that I learned is this ...   You can be a market contrarian - and try to buy real estate at the absolute low point in the market cycle - or you can be a momentum investor - and buy after prices have started to rise off the depressed market bottom.   This is excellent strategic thinking.  There is no better, safer, and more profitable way to buy any investment asset than to buy into a market where blood is deep in the street.   Good book.  I recommend it.  Robert Campbell Author of "Timing the Real Estate Market" 
 You may think spending this much on PC speakers with no subwoofer is a bit steep, but when you hear these you will be glad you spent the extra money.  Personally, I am a professional and listen to music at work as much as possible and I wanted to upgrade to attain the best sound possible without a mess of speakers everywhere.  Initially I put these on top of the desk, but the sound was so good that I found it too distracting to concentrate on my work.  So I put them under the desk where my old set had been.  The sound is still great.  The best thing about Bose is the clarity and bass response.  I don't know how they packed it into this small set, but they did.  Literally I can shake the desk if I want to.  But the clarity and enjoyment at low volume is what I am most happy about 
 Schwerdtfeger's nice little book starts at the beginning with geometry of circles, Moebius transformations (a third of the book), and it covers some selected aspects of complex function theory, but the emphasis is on elementary geometry.  Harmonic and analytic functions are only touched peripherically.          The central topics are (in this order): geometry of circles, Moebius transformations, geometry of the plane, complex numbers, transformation groups, a little hyperbolic geometry, and ending with a brief chapter on spherical and elliptic geometry.         The book was published first in 1962, but reprinted since by Dover. It is suitable as a supplement in a standard course in complex function theory, at the late undergraduate level, or perhaps at beginning graduate. While it contains attractive geometric concepts, it leaves out a systematic treatment of power series. Some readers might want to begin with that; using some of the other Dover titles on complex functions. We recommend the books by Volkovyskii et al, Flanigan, and Silverman. Review by Palle Jorgensen, August 5, 2006.  
 "The Oxford Book of Japanese Short Stories," edited by Theodore Goossen, brings together 35 stories in a volume of 452 plus xxxi pages.  The stories are arranged chronologically by the author's birth year.  The authors chosen span the generations; the collection starts out with Ogai Mori (1862-1922) and concludes with Banana Yoshimoto (b. 1964), and the rest are pretty evenly spaced out between them.  The book also includes brief biographical notes on the story writers.  This is a richly diverse collection of tales.  Many different settings, subjects, and types of characters are to be found here.  The stories range in length from three to forty pages, although the overall average is fairly short (editor Goossen, in the introduction, admits his childhood preference for stories that are short enough to be enjoyed in a single sitting).  Marriage, sex, war, slavery, crime, friendship, animals, illness, and military discipline are among the many different topics explored in an anthology that is full of horror, humor, and beauty, as well as the fantastic and the absurd.  I would like to mention some of the stories in this superb collection.  "Night Fires," by Naoya Shiga, is a beautifully written story that offers the reader a taste of life in a rural mountain area.  "Portrait of a Geisha," by Kanoko Okamoto, presents a compelling view of the geisha world through the title character and her household.  "The Accordion and the Fish Town," by Fumiko Hayashi, is about a peddler's family eking out a living in a seaside town; this story is rich in evocative details about food, clothes, family life, and economic activity in Japan.  "In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom," by Ango Sakaguchi, is extremely violent and gory, yet funny in a weird way; it's about a mountain bandit who claims a new wife as booty.  Also worthy of note--"Passage to Fudaruku," by Yasushi Inoue, is set in 1565; as the story opens, an abbot is contemplating an oceanic pilgrimage to a "mythical isle."  Atsushi Nakajima sets his story "The Expert" in ancient China.  About a man's quest to become the world's greatest archer, it's a funny, yet mystical story with a fairy tale quality.  Yukio Mishima's story "Onnagata" explores a man's fascination with a male kabuki actor who plays female roles on stage.  I was really struck by "Toddler-hunting," by Taeko Kono.  About a childless woman with a bizarre hatred for little girls and an even more bizarre fascination with little boys, this is a shocking, outrageous, and truly daring work of fiction.  Another strong entry is "The Elephant Vanishes," by Haruki Murakami; about an elephant's mysterious disappearance, this story has a surreal flavor.  There are many more great stories in this collection.  Goossen's introduction effectively establishes historical and cultural context for the Japanese short story.  I recommend saving the final section of the introduction, subtitled "Legacies," and treating it as an afterword after reading all the stories.  The insights in this section do illuminate the stories, but may, for some readers, remove some of the element of surprise that can make the stories more enjoyable (I have tried to avoid revealing too much in my own comments on the specific stories).  I have read many anthologies over the years, and I would definitely rank this one--with its generous, diverse, and consistently compelling selection of tales--among the best 
 Once again I reached for Dr. Cass' book today. I've had it for about six months and it hasn't sat closed for any two weeks in a row. I've tried several items listed and found that some worked and some didn't. One of the greatest joys is replacing a pill or supplement with real food. I'd rather eat fish than a tablespoon of fish oil!  It took time to realize that the book is written for a general audience, not just for me. Now I'm working through her suggestions methodically, patiently weeding out those that aren't right for me and keeping those that are. For instance, I discovered that high potency vitamin B "complete" supplements work well with SAMe. On the other hand, valerian only caused bad dreams.   Used in conjunction with Chris Carmichael's "Food for Fitness" and some great web resources, I find that I have both high energy and a great attitude towards life and my health 
 This guide provides a variety of exercises which add "flesh" to any group interaction.  I used it daily when I worked as a rehabilitation skills therapist with mentally ill adults.  The exercises provided a means to communicate, create trust, and build relationships.  The exercises range from simple to elaborate and fit into many situations.  This book is a great resource to use with children, adolescents, and in certain contexts with adults.  It's a must-have for any therapist, counselor, teacher, or mentoring adult 
 The book I read before this one was Rosalind McKnight's Soul Journeys which I loved.  Imagine my surprise when I picked up Paul Elder's book, Eyes of an Angel, and found myself right back at The Monroe Institute for more Astral Travel!   I feel that I learned a lot from this book and it really piqued my interest about Out of Body Experiences, etc.  Paul Elder is very honest with his account and I was surprised when he kept admitting his skepticism.  He literally had to be hit over the head with proof!!  
 I first came across this book when I was a kid, at the school library & have read it a dozen times since & it's still my very favorite.  I still finish with an awestruck shake of my head & think about it for hours afterward.  Best book I've ever read & I've read thousands 
 This is in reference to the version illustrated by D. Duntzee--some of the reviews here were a little confusing on that point.  This version is the time-honored story by H. C. Andersen which I grew up hearing.  The illustrations are really lovely and my two little girls just adore this book.  If you have a library of classic children's stories, you should add this book to it--it's wonderful! 
  Set in contemporary France and manifestly about reverberations from France's colonial past, the film is touched me deeply. On reflection, it is a nearly perfect movie, with a personal authorial sense of story telling.    I call it a masterpiece because CACHE is a work of art that takes you way beyond its surface into a state of mind that amplifies and illuminates its nominal subject.  I'm  reminded of a very different masterpiece--Pedro Almodovar's TALK TO HER--which luminously carries you into a state of love.   CACHE has the power to transport you into the web of human social connection. A sticky web, not easily seen, not easily extracted from.    In a phase, the film is about guilt and self-produced moral blindness across the various networks/divides of our socially extended selves (generations and social strata, and, to a lesser extent, gender).  Very disturbing to see/feel how we avoid responsibility for the unavoidable damage we as individuals do "in all innocence" to "others" in a stratified society.  The film--by forcing us to decide how guilty (responsible) can a six year-old be-- puts the blood in our face, and we can watch our own internal struggle with historical awareness claw past the complex processes of rationalization that keep us blind to our connection to one-another. This French film is universal because it is human.  Certainly, it has something to say to every American 
 This book is hit and miss. It is a good starting point if you want a few of facts about weaponry or combat, but not much detail. However, there are a excellent sections on food and medicine. I guess this is to be expected from a book written by a multitude of authors.   I recommend purchasing "The Writer's Complete Fantasy Reference" instead. 
 I used this book through five years of college, I found it very interesting.  It's very thorough and has great photos.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of Ar 
 Mel Gibson and Jamie Lee Curtis are fully committed to this sweet little fantasy-romance that is a great date movie or when you just need to see a "chick-flick."    Unfortunately, the DVD I purchased from amazon was defective and had to be returned, but --unless you're a die hard fan of the stars or the genre-- there's no real reason to own this one.  It's strictly a rental or you can wait around for it to be on TV--I can't imagine they edit much out for broadcast.    No noteworthy bonus features 
 The current "spotlight review" on this site complains that this video doesn't cover a wide range.  Well, why don't you direct the next one and include everything that we know about the human body, all in one hour.  Just how much of a range do you want to cover in 55 minutes.  It's a silly complaint.  We actually get to see open brain surgery being done on a conscious patient.  That's not the kind of thing I see every day.  I have only done three or four brain surgeries on conscious patients.  How about you?  We get to see a couple trying to have a baby, going for in vitro fertilization, and we see what that actually means.  We see the little sperm cells moving around in the microscope slide.    We see the smile on the lady's face when she finds out that she is pregnant with twins.  We find out why multiple births are so common with this procedure - because they implant multiple fertilized eggs into the woman in hopes that at least one of them will result in pregnancy.  I didn't know that.  And she gets to decide how many, the choices generally being 2 or 3 apparently.  We see the wife of the man who is undergoing brain surgery, and we live the experience with her as well as her husband.  We even meet their kids, the little girl who was told she may have to teach her daddy to read.  She seemed very proud that she could help.  Somebody is criticizing this video?  What an ingrate.  Pearls before ingrates.  Some other connoisseur on this site has judged that he has seen superior films, and therefore this one deserves nothing but criticism.  What are you, nuts?  Get over yourself 
   If the American public is suffering from a lack of information about the history of the presidency and the balance of power, especially prior to a national election, I don't see how a discussion of specific historical incidents can do anything but add to the lively debate in assessing the Bush presidency and the preemptive doctrine that occasioned the invasion of Iraq.  In the current political climate, dissent is under fire, accused of increasing the danger for our troops in Iraq. Recent statements from Washington indicate that such dissent may border on the treasonous. Schlesinger's book is a timely response to such assertions, because the author sites specific incidents in American history, making a strong case for the necessity of open dialog in the service of the democratic process.  The current preemptive doctrine is worthy of careful consideration. Schlesinger posits that military might is no substitute for wisdom and can only accomplish limited goals. Peace through the prevention of war is replaced with peace via preventive war, an entirely different prospect, with its own inherent problems. Even Truman opined the foolhardiness of a concept that war can only be prevented by war, "You can't 'prevent' anything by war except peace."  Preventive war depends upon accurate intelligence; certainly, it is human nature to guess the future from the experiences of the past. But do we use the historic perspective to create insight or justification for our agenda?  The future will not yield itself to the vision of one man or one nation; hence, extreme caution is imperative. We must constantly monitor the inherent dangers of power and the arrogance it breeds.  Nixon was the last president to exercise the concept of "imperial presidency", when the balance of power is upset by the executive branch, via foreign policy decisions, with a lack of congressional oversight and the aid of the attorney general. But Osama bin Laden reopened the doors of imperial presidency for our generation, John Ashcroft at the helm, promoting the Patriot Act I and II, which must allow open debate by the Congress before any restrictions are made on the freedoms we enjoy.   Certain question arise, in reading this book and considering the problems at hand; for example, if war does nurture the concept of the imperial presidency,  and certainly the events of 9/11 have made the public more vulnerable and willing to take direction from our leaders, do a democratic people have a moral obligation to stop dissent during wartime? Is this the example shown by our forefathers? And, in a nation born of dissent, what is the nature of patriotism? Schlesinger answers all these questions in detail. The answers are surprisingly informative, certainly worth consideration.  Both popular and electoral votes were at issue in the last election and may be again, so the author includes the pros and cons of the arguments as the framers of the constitution grappled with the safest way to preserve the will of the people. There are also issues regarding the uninhibited pursuit of runaway capitalism and its inherent dangers, including the imminence of a complicated global economy.  Religious fanaticism breeds terrorism, yet people are drawn together in the comfort of spiritual identity, searching for meaning in their lives, so how do we achieve a balance that allows belief systems to coexist, without taking advantage of the obvious fear or one "God" trumping another? It is critical that we refuse to allow fanatics to usurp emotion-driven decisions that cause violence in the name of God.  These are difficult times with serious issues confronting the voters and debate is critical if we are to live within the intended framework of our democracy. "The great strength of democracy is its capacity for self-correction", whether in the global market, the pressures of race and assimilation or spiritual frustration caused by global anonymity. As citizens, we are intimately invested in a process that has so far been successful in safeguarding our values and democratic ideals, but we cannot avoid personal responsibility when electing those to best represent us.  In the final analysis, history documents the nature of dissent in this country and the fact that no president has been sacrosanct, whether the country is at war or not, is well established. Dissent is viable in a democracy, dialog the lifeblood of citizenship and critical to voters. Schlesinger's book suggests an appreciation of our rich history of dissent and the valuable lessons of experience, positive and negative. Stimulating curiosity in pursuit of lively discussion is never a waste of time. Luan Gaines/2004. 
 This is all about bread and how its many phases is similar to life. Because of the unique concept, the story is completely intriguing. A bakery takes center stage, the owner is coaching a new employee, while dealing with her own personal issues. A good read.

 I was impressed by this clear and concise guide. As an undergrad, I took a legal writing class. We had no textbook, but we could have used this one. Now, I'm in law school, where I found this book on my own. Half the work is trying to figure out what legal types are saying. Judges and lawyers could make my job easier by reading this book. As a student, I find it a good resource to help avoiding such pitfalls 
 McCullough's biographies and histories are among the best available, combining superb scholarship with easy reading, and this history of the Brooklyn Bridge is superb.   While I was carrying this around, several people asked why I was reading it, and three immediate answers came to mind: First, because it's a great read! This is every bit as good as most novels, and more fun that most. Second, it's a wonderful study in character. When most of our news is filled with controversy and scandal, here are two men (father and son) who stood as exemplars of honesty, determination, courage and faithfulness. If you want someone to model your life after, I recommend either of these men - or Emily Roebling, Washington's wife and assistant. And third, because 130 years later, the Brooklyn Bridge remains one of America's great engineering feats, as well as a work of art.  The father, John Roebling, was a true genius. Arriving from Germany as a young man, he founded a city (Saxonburg), perfected the concept of suspension bridges, and built one of the great companies of the 19th century. Then in a tragic accident during the preliminary surveys for the bridge, he was injured and died a horrible death of tetanus shortly afterward.   His son, Washington, took over work on the bridge and devoted the next fourteen years of his life to seeing it through. The details of the construction, by themselves, make this an amazing read!  This is one of those books that  may not come up as a topic in most social situations, but it'll make you a better person and you'll like yourself for having read it. It's not a casual weekend read, but it's well worth the effort. Highly recommended. 
 Larry Cohen is so incredibly unsubtle in every gaudy, ridiculous move he makes, but "The Stuff" takes the cake.  This movie is hilarious.  I can remember few times in which I have watched my television and had so much fun.  Every cut away shot, every leap in logic, every incontinuity of this movie is burned in my brain.  I have seen a lot of movies, and this is the most poorly written, directed, and executed of them all.  Every time the film tries to be subversive, it hits you in the face with a hammer, and every time it doesn't do this, you have no idea what's going on.  This movie is nothing, absolutely nothing, short of terrible.  In every respect.  That said, I love "The Stuff".  See it, and consider yourself part of the club.  I guarantee you won't regret it 
 More Americans need to read books like this one and "Kiss the Boys Goodby" and KNOW that our government delibertly left POW's behind in Vietnam. And that some of them are still alive!!!!!!!!!!!!and still waiting to be brought home!!!!!!!!!! Also those politians who left them there and who have continued the coverup need to be held accountable 
 I was personally a little confused with the review written by Patty Benson, who claims that Sarah Ban Breathnach is Jewish and that is why she makes so many refrences regarding the Jewish religion. To begin with the author is not Jewish, she was raised Catholic. So the book is full of "Non-Jewish wisdom." Secondly, the book is not about religion which I feel people might assume from the previous review, the book incorporates elements from all religions and searches out the spirtual aspects within each that can be universally appreciated by everyone. And yes sometimes this does include quotes from Jewish mystics. If you're looking for a book that excludes the world at large and focuses on Christianity then perhaps you should read The Purpose Driven Life. If you're looking for a book that embraces the idea of "spirit" and tries to relate it to all walks of life then you should read Simple Abundance. 
 This case fits the camera well, along with space for an extra battery and several compact flash cards.  DO NOT buy this case if you use filters.  There is no extra space for the large 67mm adapter or the filters themselves 
 The book is well written and thought through. Exciting charaqcters, linked details and a chill designed to run down your spine. Davey and the Grey Lady are great nemeisis. If want a book other then Harry Potter or want something exicting, this is for you 
 I really enjoyed reading this book. I also loved the movie! One of a kind 
 Best book in the series yet - Adults like it as much as the kid 
 According to Dougal Dixon in 50 million years man will be extinct. This certainly is a possibility. If this does not happen we certainly hope that man will have evolved away from war and greed. Based upon the life expectancy of our sun, the earth and evolutionary processes will be here for up to another 5000 million years.  Dixon does a masterful job of speculating how life forms will evolve over the next 50 million years. He presents detailed color drawings of the new life forms. His work is visionary and will help the reader form his own vision of the future 
 I absolutely love this cookbook because it is simple and no-nonsense but yet full of very nice and tasty recipes. What I personally like best about this book is that often you'll find a base recipe for i.e. cookie dough, souffle, pancakes, you name it and then has several different flavour variations. So one dish, many different flavours. Too easy!! I am going sailing soon and have been assigned to the cooking - this will be my bible as we travel... ;- 
 Bernard Ramm has done an exemplary job of painting the broad strokes of protestant hermeneutics.  He does work quite a lot with the history of interpretation, and less with the technical aspects of it but that is not only to be expected with a book on hermeneutics (rather than exegesis), it is essential to the understanding of how doctrine developed.  When we see the hermeneutical mistakes of those in the past, and the damage it has caused (for instance, though not in this book, Augustine's switch to Amillennialism and with it allegorical interpretation of prophesy opened the door to the 1000+ years of darkness of biblical scholarship under the dominance of the Catholic church, not to mention the mess it has made with people's understanding of the gospel even now [i.e. Lordship Salvation] see Dave Anderson's articles in number 28-29 of the Journal of the Grace Evangelical Society) it not only sobers us into being more careful with our hermeneutical approach to Scriptures, it makes us more aware of our strengths and weaknesses in theology and exegesis. Read this book and take it very seriously (or better yet, take Hermeneutics from Dr. Radmacher through distance learning at Western Seminary).  Don't assume, like everyone does, that the way you've always been taught is the truth.  Learn some hermeneutics and go to the Word to find out 
 When I was 14, my grandmother got me this albulm for Christmas.  I was quite unenthused at the time as I had no interest in piano music.  Regardless, I popped it into my cd player a couple days later, not expecting much.  During track 9, (a moment I will never forget) my life actually changed forever.  His boogie woogie improvisations BLEW MY MIND in a very litteral sense.    The sound was so rich and amazing that the room got really bright (I think because my pupils dialated), I turned the volume way up and just pressed my head against my boom-box and I started uncontrollably laughing and crying at the same time.  It felt like I was going mad, but it was just the first time I had ever been high on musical extasy.    I am now a 22 year old musician, and this is still the greatest solo piano albumm I have ever heard, and my most enduering favorite.  This album broke me out of my pop music rut and started my life-long passion for jazz and classical music.   Buy this album for someone, especially if they're narrow minded when it comes to music.  You might just change their life 
 We have a similair toy by Melissa & Doug (i think) that has doors and latches, but...this one is so much more fun & educational too! it's a shape sorter, has the doors to open & close, and latches that my son hasn't even really played with yet! He loves the pieces and putting them in the holes, taking them out the doors, etc...I'm very sad to hear that other's have had problems with it...we bought it for my son for christmas - he was 9 months old, but with 2 older brothers, so...we have little pieces everywhere, so we watch him most all the time as he plays...we leave it on the floor and have not had a problem with the latches, doors, pieces, or weight! but again i'm with him or watching him when he plays! (but don't feel THIS toy is unsafe - others in our house yes...) This is one toy i wish we had gotten with my first son - the best shape sorter in my opinion and we have about 5! And my 2 older kids play with the baby all the time! it's definitely the baby's (and maybe the 4 and 6 year olds too!) Latches aren't any more dangerous than the one's on Melissa & Doug's so...maybe that is why the 18+ months age range!? 
 Although it wasn't exactly what I needed(my fault) it was in excellent condition and shipped promtl 
 This is an intimidating book to pick up and read given its length and scope of coverage. However, I am pleased I finally did. Orlando Figes is an insightful expert on Russia, a very good writer, and one who chooses cultural material that suits his well informed taste. I have read many books on the politics of the USSR. This was a good reminder that Russia has had a rich cultural history before, during and transcending the Reds 
 Do not wait to read this book. The title is just right! It gives me new ideas about designing my garden space as well as great tips to improve my gardener's skills, even if in my case, both were limited. I really recommend it. 
 A somewhat unusual J.A. Jance read.  Edge of frightening.  Good writing.  Hard to put down 
 As you can tell from the title of my review, this is going to be a positive review! I'll tell honestly any problems I think the book has, but frankly, there aren't many. This book is one of the very few that SUCCESSFULLY combines humor, romance, and science fiction all in one book. I loved this book because the characters are so real, even if they aren't swashbuckling heroes or evil, power-hungry villains, or strange, fascinating aliens. I really enjoy hard-core science fiction, but this book was so enjoyable, so funny, so enthralling, that it shot to the top of my list.   I won't summarize the plot here, but I'll mention a few interesting points: one, the whole premise of the book involves time-travel. In the late 21st century, time travel has been invented; but because you can only travel to places and times where your presence cannot affect the future, time-travel can't be exploited for gain. So time-travel is really only interesting to historians. This allows Willis to set her story at Oxford, with a bunch of characteristically nerdy historians and academics as the main characters.   Second, the plot revolves in many ways around the reconstruction of Coventry Cathedral, sponsored by an absolutely rabid, rich old lady that due to her large donations to the History Department, has been able to commandeer the services of every time-traveling historian to serve her purposes. Add in a beautiful, young, lady historian; a dashing young, naïve, confused male historian, and a cat that has potentially destroyed the space-time continuum and you have all the makings of a great story. Another interesting point is that the book was in many ways inspired by one of the very few Victorian comedies, "Three Men in a Boat"...to say nothing of the dog..... (the fourth companion). You don't have to have read the other book, but it does add to the enjoyment as is quite funny in its own right.   As for problems with the book: there aren't many, but I have heard many complain that the first part of the book drags a bit. I can understand why, though it didn't for me. At a minimum, though, please be prepared to stick with it, because the very beginning of the book is seen through the eyes of Ned, who is going bonkers from too much time travel AND is exploring the destroyed Coventry Cathedral. So the first few pages are confusing both because Ned is confused AND because of the all the Church terminology: nave, apse, and so on. But it is WORTH it! I promise! Another possible complaint is the constant revisiting of the plot by the characters. The characters are faced with one of those classic time-travel problems; you know, the whole, if I went back in time and killed my grandfather-type problems, and they are desperately trying to sort it out. So they spend a lot of time running through the scenarios. That could get tedious (again, didn't for me). Finally, one long-running prop in the novel is something called the Bishop's Bird stump, which the characters are familiar with, and talk about throughout the novel, but the reader is in the dark until the end. That was a little annoying.   Seriously, though, this novel won the Hugo for a reason. It is well-paced, funny, smart, clever, and even sappily romantic in a way that touched even me, someone who normally prefers Glen Cook's gritty violence. I could not recommend this book more highly and the author, Connie Willis. I've read everything she's written and have NEVER been disappointed 
 Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques  PLEASE NOTE: I have to preface this review by saying that I am reviewing the audio version of the book. I did not actually read the books so I am sure many of my spellings of names are probably spelled wrong. Not owning the print book, I cannot confirm the correct spellings.  WARNING: If you have not read the first two books in the trilogy, then don't read this review. Each book starts where the previous finished and as such it is not possible to avoid all spoilers about the preceding titles.  Black has turned to Red, and now White has the chance to swallow all the darkness forever. Will evil finally be conquered in either world?  In our earth, the virus has circled the globe and everyone is afflicted, causing massive chaos. Thomas Hunter has gone missing and may very well be dead. Monique has also disappeared and with her, all hope of finding a cure for the virus. Even in light of two such great losses (for are they really lost?), there may still be a chance to save the world. Unfortunately that price may be too high for some of our beloved heroes.   In the other world, Justin had been put to death, and returned to life, only to then go away after Thomas and his small band of those still loyal to the true Elyon are reborn to The Circle. But is He ever really gone? Thomas and the Circle now preach peace instead of war. They will not raise their swords against the ever-growing Horde no matter what happens. Even the death of Thomas' beloved Rochelle will not turn him from the new course set to follow Justin.   And this is all just the beginning of the Great Pursuit...  Thomas' new duty is to bring even more Horde into Elyon's fold. But this is made increasingly difficult by the fact the Horde's "religion" has become so twisted and warped that they have completely lost sight of who Elyon really is and what He wants. Until Shelice comes in to the picture... She is daughter to Korang, ruler of all Horde, and she is quite taken with their newest prisoner, the great Thomas of Hunter. After forced proximity to Shelice for some time, he comes to love her dearly. His hope now is to make her understand the Truth and follow Justin as He desires.  War still wages of a different sort, but this time the prize is everyone's souls.  Thomas' desperation had grown as our world came to the brink of Armageddon, as did the other world as well. As time runs out, the readers feel the hope of our beloved ensemble of characters fading. Though the resolution to the horrors facing our Earth is shocking, it really isn't as much of a surprise as it could have been. The revelations of key components made me stop a moment, until I realized I actually knew what it would come down to all along. However, that does not by any means lessen the impact of the climactic moment where the fate of both worlds hangs in the balance.  As The Circle trilogy progressed, we spent more and more time in the other world. That is where the strongest forces were waging battle and only with the help of Elyon could ours be saved. Here, we discover the true meaning of The Great Romance and why we all must take it into our hearts. It seems odd to think of a relationship with God as a romance and to consider his followers a bride, but strangely enough, it works here. This concluding title is far more deeply spiritual then the prior books. White is all about sacrifice, making peace and finding love in a Higher Power. The similarities between the beliefs of The Circle and the beliefs of Christianity cannot be overlooked.  White sent a strong message of peace into my heart and reinforces beliefs that through tolerance and understanding of those different from ourselves we can really know God. To Him, we are all the same. It is our own corruption and prejudice that make us susceptible to evil and hate. The Circle trilogy will remind readers that there is Someone greater out there than themselves.  At the conclusion of this trilogy, I am once again amazed with Rob Lamont. I'm a huge audio book fan so I've heard lots of different performers, but I think he ranks up there at the top for me after finishing The Circle. The depths of his talent have barely been plumbed. His exceptional performance did much to enhance this listening experience for me. He made it even more impossible not to be moved by our beloved friends' lives. For Thomas and company have truly become the readers' friends and won't be easily forgotten.   I have never been a strong reader of inspirational fiction, but Black, White, and Red by Ted Dekker brought strong emotions to the forefront for me that will stay with me long after concluding the trilogy. The Circle trilogy is easily one of the best reads I've encountered this year and has really made me think more than I had expected.  © Kelley A. Hartsell, September 2006. All rights reserved 
 If you could learn to rock climb from a book, this would be it. One of the best general references to rock climbing. John Long is an entertaining writer in his own right 
 This is a book you should read before you quit your job. This book is the one you can trust. It includes almost everything you need to know about working from your home. No wonder it's a fifth edition 
 In 2001 as a sophomore in college, I read Richard Ford's short story "Communist".  It was in the anthology we purchased for the class, and may have been in the "Rock Springs" collection.  I was enthralled with the story and the author's sheer writing ability; if ever I read an author and thought "natural talent", Ford would come to mind.  However, I never quite got around to reading "The Sportswriter".  I flirted with it, picked it up at the library a couple of times, but never made the commitment to actually read it.  Ford has a nice house in the Maine town that I live in, and it just so happens that two summers ago -- while I was working for a landscaping company -- I did a lot of work on his house.  While I mostly dealt with his wife, I did have one short talk with him.  I told him that I loved "Communist", but perhaps he thought I was pandering.  I've read more than any person I've ever met, though, so it was actually high (if perhaps worthless to him) praise.    I have just gotten around to re-reading "The Sportswriter", and finished it this afternoon.  What to say about it?  Complicated.  I find it complicated in any number of ways, though I was once again struck by Ford's astounding ability to simply write eloquently.  I'm talking on a very basic level, and by that I mean the nuts and bolts of the story -- which is precisely why I called him a natural talent.  Very rarely will he amaze you with a striking image, which is to say that he is not a writer whose work is infused with imagery.  What he does do is get inside the head of his narrator, and enclose himself -- and by connection, you, the reader -- into the thoughts and observations of Frank Bascombe.  Bascombe is, thankfully, quite an interesting fellow, and Ford's writing makes for a book easy enough to read -- even though it's mostly just internal dialogue.  Certainly a book made up mostly of relatively unimportant observations is not life changing, though I do believe it to be life-affirming.  Frank never seems to get too riled up about anything, and neither does "The Sportswriter".    Are you going to be blown away?  Will it change your life, will you cry, will you be inspired?  I sort of doubt it.  Perhaps.  I'm certain it's like nothing you've ever read, and I'm also certain that -- like "Communist" -- it's pretty damn good.  
 Blue Mars is Kim Stanley Robinson's final, and lengthiest, installment that concludes the Mars terraforming adventure.  The First Hundred are nearly 200 years of age (and will grow older by book's end), and Mars's surface slowly begins to bubble with liquid.  In Green Mars, Robinson took the reader back to Earth.  He gave us a first-hand look at the population explosion and the rising seas, while introducing us to Art and his philosophically autocratic employer.  Robinson returns to Earth in the third book, this time taking Nirgal, the super-athletic Martian, Maya, Michel, and Sax.  A volcanic eruption beneath the Antarctic ice sheet melts half of the White Continent and raises the sea level by 23 feet around the entire globe.  Our heroes arrive to Terra Aqua where the aboveground political activities and adventures through underwater cities create a starkly contrasting but pleasant digression from the pseudo-hygrophilous forests and dry lichens of Mars.  (Unrelated, a 1955 astronomy text proves that scientists at the time thought dark patches on Mars were created by lichen growing on the surface!)  The inception of human-manipulated hydrometeorology began in Red Mars with the atmospheric collision of an ice asteroid.  1140 pages later, in Part 7 of Blue Mars, Sax, Nadia, and fellow scientists focus their cognitive energies on creating, controlling, fighting against, or sustaining what would eventually become oceans, gulfs, bays, seas and lakes, all of which are mostly located in the northern hemisphere.  The disputes and ultimate agreements (reluctant acquiescence) between the environmentalists and the terraformers rivals the frustrations from the earlier two novels.  So begins the hydrology, hydrobiology, eventual hydrodynamics, and everything else "hydro" that will tear apart, develop, or re-establish the friendships and relationships that make up the Mars Trilogy's realistic realm of fiction.  Some of the more fantastic journeys take place beyond Earth and Mars.  As rocket propulsion technology becomes increasingly powerful (Mars to Earth in three days), so too become the terraforming efforts of nearly every planet and moon in the Solar System.  "People would do anything for the sake of an idea, anything" (498).  Robinson takes the reader (along with the feral Zo, Jackie's daughter) to witness the new frontiers of Mercury, whose city moves slowly on rails; Venus, whose greenhouse effects are being reversed (to be completed in the next 300 years); Ann Clayborne joins Zo to visit the terraforming of Jupiter's moons Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, and Io; and finally the moons of Uranus.  Robinson's imagery here is reminiscent of those previously imagined worlds, deep-green skies, dark rocky landscapes, and ringed planets hovering palely over the horizon.  As our heroes grow older, they become wiser to the inevitabilities of memory-loss and death.  As they (primarily Sax) struggle with antidotes and formulae to inhibit the frightening realities, the remaining of the First Hundred seem to grow calm and spiritual.  Although they have literally created a new, peaceful world out of a barren rock, a sort of Walden Two of the Solar System, they soon realize that there is more to life than always fighting to survive.  Even the crazed Maya slows down.  Robinson's prose is always in motion.  Admittedly the political exposition is usually drier than, for instance, the poetic science of Sax's discussions and thoughts.  But it is all-necessary.  Once the trilogy is completed, the holistic work becomes a memory the reader has lived through and experienced.  Interestingly, the completed planet is not so far removed from the reader's ability to relate to it; in fact, Mars becomes so Earth-like in Nature, I felt briefly shocked at imagining these characters in familiar surroundings.  Suddenly, I understood who they were and what they had accomplished, completely 
      The Ultimates is a book about a group of super heros who join together to fight super crime. They dont always get along, eventually, this conflict results in the death of an Ultimate       My favorite part of this book was when The Hulk came in to fight. It took a lot of time to defeat him, and some of the ultimates were injured. When they defeated him, they found out that he was just a sad man.      I recommend this book because it is full of action and violence. The charictors in this book act like regular people. They arent just people without a history or backround. People with regular problems and some super problems. This has been one of my favorite book 
 "open your heart" is the best song of madonna.  dress up, material girl and like a virgin are very very incredible........ for me madonna is the numbre one since yesterday 'till ever for ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Timely delivery.  The book was great.  My great grandson loved it 
 I think this is one of the better dog magazines out there. The articles are varied, informative and well-researched 
 A day, actually several, in the life of a pool hustler and his stakehorse. A very colorful and well told/written story. Sometimes the language gets a little ruff; but that's what happens when you write a true life account. Worth the read, especially for anyone considering pool for more than just a hobby 
 Robert W. McChesney's exploration into the historical underpinnings and contemporary realities facing the United States media system has proven to be an extremely well-researched discussion.  The Problem of the Media covers the evolution of American systems of journalism and entertainment media while exploring the problems of this evolution in their current manifestations.  McChesney has produced an almost unerring synopsis of current problems facing the media, and, unlike most of his colleagues, offers real optimism and motions for future change. 	 I was extremely pleased with the way McChesney illuminates the historical nature of the media in the United States.  He does a phenomenal job at coupling past incarnations of American media structures in their inherently partisan and biased formulations with today's antiseptic and sterile "professional" variety.  The Problem of the Media is exceptional in this historical analysis as it does a logical and rational job of dropping left hook after right cross to the philosophical and practical foundations of the professional journalistic structures.  It was as if someone has finally shown me real foundations, actual alternatives, and structures for change, but the beautiful part of all of this was that they had actually already existed (and in this country to boot).	 	 McChesney's arguments are absolutely extraordinary as he goes toe to toe with the right wing noise machine's accusations of the liberal bias that exists within the mainstream newsroom.  Drawing upon cogent arguments backed up with innumerable sources, McChesney goes on to systematically deconstruct the false arguments that are time and again posed by the conservative sophists that dominate the entirety of American information mediums.  I have read several texts arguing against the so-called "liberal media," but none were as persuasive and apt as McChesney's proved to be.  In addition to this, I thought that The Problem of the Media also did a very astute job of explaining to the reader all of the news that has not been covered in mainstream press, while foolish and arguably unimportant issues take to the forefront of coverage.  Examples of this reality include the extremely lackluster and ill-timed coverage of the 2000 American Presidential elections as well as the seemingly censor-ridden coverage of the current war (if it can even be called that) in Iraq. 	 McChesney does not stop at the line of criticizing the current journalistic regime and its anti-democratic systems of "professionalism" and obtuse neutrality, but instead goes on to make vital connections between a capitalism gone crazy (hyper-capitalism) and the entertainment industry.  I think if any regular American took the time to sit down and ready chapter four of The Problem of the Media s/he would find that s/he intuitively knew about the detrimental affects of massive media conglomerates, oligopolistic market controls, and the current manifestation of an increasingly intrusive and overbearing advertising/public relations sector.  McChesney does a fine job at providing the reader with real examples of televisions shows (i.e. Monster Garage, Trading Spaces) that use this disgusting development in embedded advertising strategies and exposes the companies that support this process for what they are.   	 Fortunately, McChesney closes The Problem of the Media with words of encouragement and optimism.  The discussion abounds with the realization that in order for there to be the massive change for a new positive media evolution their must be widespread education on the topic.  This book is a fantastic step in furthering that agenda, however I am somewhat skeptical as I believe the media system is simply a tool of the neoliberal policy agenda, and as I understand it unless the greater economic beast is laid to rest, its pups will continue to thrive. 
 Max Lacudo explains the beatitudes in such a simple yet enlightening way one can't help but say "yes" as you read!  He literally changed my life as I realized through this book that I too wanted to be up on the Mountain, and not left in the valley.  And King of the Mountain is not the goal! For anyone looking to find the light this is the book!  I keep extra copies to pass on and give as gifts.  A wonderful book 
 At first I didn't want to read a book about someone on death row but I figured, it's John Grisham it will probably be good and it is.   This books is not an action packed book like some of his others, the Pelican Brief, The Firm or Runaway Jury but it is thoroughly interesting.   It takes this KKK member named Sam Cayhill who is on death row and talks about his life and how he got there. It's really quite a sad story for not only him and his victims but also his family who has been torn apart because of his actions, those that have left him on death row and some of those that did not.   It's really quite moving reading about the emotions that come to everyone involved when someone is about to be gassed etc and John Grisham does a wonderful job slowly leading you to that point.  This book might not change your opinion on the death penalty but it will definitely let you look at it differently through the eyes of a prisioner and his family etc.   A good read for those who have time for a slower paced book that leads to a purpose. If you need nonstop action in a book then this is not the one to pick up.    
 Walcott's photograph on the back of the 1st edition sums up the feeling of  Bounty- Sorrow, the grief of the death of friends and loved ones, faith in  God seen "as through a glass darkly", the exhaustion of a  sensitive man aware of his own mortality. Yet, through it all is the great  sense of gratitude for the folk culture of the country that has nurtured  him. And if he will not make great declarations of religious faith, he is  thankful for the sun on the leaves, the ocean outside his door, the songs  of Sessenne the folk singer of St. Lucia. Like Crusoe and Odysseus, this  fortunate traveller has returned to his bench on the edge of the sea under  the breadfruit leaves, "where stars and fireflies breed." This  poet is past posturing. "The only art left is the preparation of  grace", and even now, ever the bright eyed poet (behind the tears of  the aging sage), he is "going down to the shallow edge to begin  again." Walcott's only vocation has been poetry, his universe that of  letters. In this he has never lost his faith 
 Ordinary Resurrections is one of the most important books I've ever read and one of the most poignantly beautiful. It is an absolute must read for everyone who cares about children, the wide disparity in economic opportunity in the U.S., and who dares to hope for our future. Kozol movingly brings to life in his first-hand descriptive account the lives and conditions in their own words of children and their families who have been deliberately neglected, ignored, hidden away. This true story of their hope, strength, resilience, and beauty testifies to the dominance of the human spirit in the face of unspeakable abuse by government at every level and all systems that have failed them 
 My daugher is 2yrs old and really enjoys getting to put a sticker on the chart next to the potty. It has helped a lot with her potty training since she doesn't get a sticker unless she goes. I would recommend the book to anyone 
 This is one of the business classics in the past twenty years.  It has sold a huge number of copies and I am sure many of those purchased copies were actually read!  As impressive as its sales numbers have been, the way it has affected the approach to the way business was discussed and talked about for the past dozen years has been even more impressive.  Yes, there are always newer fads and business is subject to fads more than most fields of human endeavor.  There are lots of theories about why this is so, but it might have something to do with the new managers coming in wanting to bring something new with them and so the previous guy's stuff is no good.  Hence, something comes and something goes for reasons beyond its ability to run business in a sound and profitable way.  However, when something comes along with some real substance it spreads and lasts, at least for awhile.  The ideas of core values and big (hairy audacious) goals hit a chord and lasted.  Of course, today they are part of the air businesspeople breathe rather than a quote from this book.  The authors looked at a number of big companies and found a list of those that had been around a long time, been financially successful, and were on a roll at the time of this book (but they don't say this is one of their criteria).    They also found some comparable big company that hadn't found the level of success of the "visionary company" as they call the successful firms.  They then looked for some traits common to those big successful companies that might explain their success.    The four big principles they came up with were: 1) Be a clock builder - or architect - not a time teller [once you read the chapter it will be clear], 2) Embrace the genius of the AND, 3) Preserve the core / stimulate progress, and 4) seek consistent alignment.  All this has to do with being opportunistic, building the organization that best supports the opportunities you are pursuing rather than letting the organization dictate what you pursue, that success requires doing seemingly contradictory goals simultaneously, making sure that the core culture gets preserved (if it has been a successful culture), and making sure that the whole process is focused on the core ideology - the core values and core purpose of the organization.  Sounds simple?  It's not.  And even so, the "visionary" companies the book lauded a dozen years ago have all, or almost all, fallen on various levels of hard times since the book came out.  This fact is addressed in a soft way in the frequently asked questions addition for this paperback addition.  There is also a new last chapter on building the vision and a section on questions for research (this acknowledges areas left unexplained by the book).    A book that has been this influential deserves your attention if you are interested in business literature.  However, as with all of these books, use the principles as they apply to your real life in the real world of competitive business rather than treating them as some kind of final truth.  
 This book is not only well-written, but also well designed, making it a perfect gift for any scholarly type on your gift list. And if that includes you, then go hog wild and get one for yourself 
 "The Sure Thing" (1985) is perhaps one of the most underrated comedies of an era that was bursting at the seams with romantic comedies. John Cusack stars as Walter Gibson ("Gib"), a college freshman who is attending school at an unnamed Ivy League college.  He is disappointed that his romantic life is somewhat lacking (although, inexplicably, his unattractive, overweight roommate is scoring a lot of action) but sees hope with Alison (Daphne Zuniga), an extremely uptight, prissy girl who adheres to routine like a religion that is in his English class.  Gib's high school friend Lance (Anthony Edwards, just before his breakout in "Top Gun") has gone to school out in Southern California and invites Gib to come out over the Christmas break as Lance has a girl that is a "sure thing" and Gib is sure to score.  Gib ends up in a cross-country adventure with the prissy Alison, heading out to California to visit her equally uptight and unexciting fiance Jason (Boyd Gaines), and nutty Gary Cooper (Tim Robbins, in an early film role) - - "but not that Gary Cooper that's dead" and Mary Ann (Lisa Ann Persky), two people that are so perky and into showtunes that you wish that Gib would hurl himself out the car window.   As can be expected, Gib and Alison develop feelings for one another during the road trip.  What happens when they get to California?  Will Gib hook up with The Sure Thing (Nicollette Sheridan)?  Will Alison stay engaged to Jason?  Will she realize that Gib is perfect for her? The ending should be absolutely no surprise but the journey is all the fun. Rob Reiner does a terrific job with this little film, and John Cusack is simply awesome!  This role, along with Lloyd Dobler from "Say Anything", really put him on the map.  His Gib comes across as a funny, romantic, touching guy - - not a partyer, not a horndog.  You can really relate to Gib, and that makes him real.  And it makes the movie work.  The story is nothing new, but with Cusack at the helm, the movie takes off. Daphne Zuniga as Alison is perfectly cast.  She's a pretty girl, without being standout stunning, and her gradual realization that there is more to Gib than meets the eye doesn't seem forced.   If you're feeling nostalgic for the 80s, or want to watch a great, underrated movie from the 80s, put this one in.  You won't be disappointed 
 Don Giovanni is a simply wonderful opera, but for this single-language speaking gal I was at a loss for understanding.  I looked high and low for a good translation, finally deciding on this which has side-by-side readings of the opera in itallian and english.  It's easy to read.  It has a good introduction and great footnotes that give you a little extra information to take with you as you read.  Unlike other companions, it includes every word spoken, so you don't get lost when they repeat themselves!    There's really not much to say about it -- simple, straightfoward, and worth the money 
 I really enjoy watching this movie. I love to hear Dolly Parton sing and Sly is always good to laugh at and with. My whole family aged 7 - 41, enjoy this film; anytime. I live in Australia and have been looking in stores for over two years for Rhinestone to appear on DVD I should have gone to Amazon a long time ago and saved the hassle 
 The sixth edition of "Elements" was published in 1995, and reviewers familiar with the advances in cartographic technology would be familiar with the great upheaval the field was going through at that time.  Work on a seventh edition of this seminal text is currently underway, which should bring the content of the book up to par with recent changes.  The book remains an important source of information for both the novice and seasoned cartographer 
 Christmas is a magical time of the year.  The Rankin-Bass Original Television Christmas Classics add more warmth to the fire that is the holidays.  Born in 1985 I am nearly 20 years shy of the first time these classics were televised.  But I still remember seeing them as a child on TV during the season and falling in love with them.  These are a must for the holidays 
 The first was good But the others were not I could watch tremors over and over But the other were ok but not as good 
 "Survivor in death" is the 23rd book in the "In death" series. If you already are a fan of the series, I am pretty sure you will like it a lot, as it has a good plot, fast-paced action, and continues with the development of the characters you already probably love. On the other hand, if you are new to the series, I would advise you to read it in order, instead of jumping ahead. Trust me, you will enjoy all the books more in that way.  That having been said, what is up in this new book?. A family has been murdered during the night, and there is only one survivor, a very scared young girl, Nixie. Lieutenant Eve Dallas is primary at the scene, and she will do her best to catch the murderers. The problem is, there is no evident reason to kill the family, nothing that stands out as suspicious in the lives of Nixie's parents. But surely, they must have done something to provoke the wrath of whomever killed them in their beds, despite their high-tech security system.  Dallas decides to take Nixie to her house, overcoming the objections of the social worker in the case, and due to the fact that the little girl doesn't want to part with her. There is a problem, though. Eve is more scared of children than of criminals, and both her and Roarke are more or less out of their depth in their dealings with Nixie. Thanksfully, they have Summerset (the "frog-faced demon from hell", according to Eve), who takes care of Nixie while the case heats ups and the murderers of her family go on killing, with an ultimate target in mind: Nixie.  In "Survivor in death" you will meet again (if briefly) old characters of the series, as well as the regular "cast" (Eve, Roarke, Peabody, Feeney, Mavis, Summerset, Trueheart, Baxter, etc...). Something stands out rather starkly, and that is that Eve was somewhat cold towards Nixie. In my opinion, that had to do with two facts: that Nixie's ordeal made Eve remember her own, and that Eve isnt comfortable with children (do you remember "Ceremony in death"?). Both Nixie and Eve are survivors, but their past and nightmares are vastly different. Eve realizes that, and will do all in her power to protect Nixie, keeping her alive and not leaving her at the mercy of the system. Roarke is also an important character in "Survivor in death", and you will see him going to the rescue once again, and scaring the daylights out of Eve mentioning the possibility of having children "one day"...  All in all I can say that I really liked this book. It kept me entertained, and I enjoyed it till the very last page. This is another worthy addition to the series, and I highly recommend it to you...  Belen Alca 
 Guns For General Washington is a great book because of the action and advenerture. Henry Knox, a patroit who goes to Fort Ticonderoga, a fort in New York that has at least 183 cannons, lead for bullets, flint for flintlock muskets. There were also mortars, a type of gun, howitzers, a another type of gun,and a cohorns, another type of gun. They, Henry and his brother and some others who help out, have to go 300 miles to Fort Ticonderoga from Boston and 300 miles back to Boston from Fort Ticonderoga.This takes place in Massachusetts and New York in 1775 and 1776. The conflict is that General Washington is fighting a british general ,General Howe, with no aritillery like cannons and gunpowder.This book has very good action and advenertur 
 I feel so bad that this seat has such a low ranking. It is perfect for my girl. I do understand why people with boys may have issues, but if you have a girl it is just wonderful. I have a very cheap one that is designed similarly but this one is so much better. It has a great weight to it so it's not flimsy, and it fits my girls bum so nicely, and the cushion is very firm yet soft. The handles make is so easy for her to just climb up on the stool, sit and pull herself back. My friend has the pricey Bjorn and while that is nice, I saved $15 on something that works just as well 
 Louise Gluck's book is not just an ordinary book of lyrical poetry. Her poems collaborates on marriage, and the difficulties associated with the marriage of The Odyssey. Her poems are like a story, and readers can't wait to see what is written on the next page. Each story is related because each has to do with a certain situation in life. In a way, each story is connected. Later poems pick up where other poems are left off. Meadowlands is a book of different voices. I love how she portrays the women as a powerful voice. Unlike The Odyssey which deals with Odysseus and his voyage, Gluck makes sure that the characters not portrayed as much in the book, to have a voice. For example, Circe was Odysseus's conquest. He had an affair with her, and left to return home. In The Odyssey, we do not know how she is feeling nor did we care. Gluck however shows her emotion, and anger. We can connect with her, and feel her pain because she is hurt. Penelope represents a woman whom in a relationship bickers, argues about taking out the garbage, and throwing a dysfunctional party. She does not exactly represent Gluck as a whole. Not only are the womens voices heard, but Telemachus who is Penelope and Odysseus's son is also heard. Telemachus represents a mature child who adjusts to the worst of his parents experiences. He represents the possibility of love or loving. Teenagers who read this poem can relate to the hardships of not being loved by their parents. In a way, Gluck transforms herself into these different characters to show the different aspects of her personality. The scheme of the books elaborates on the characters of the Odyssey to tell the story of dissolving marriage, tension, and no longer being in love. The poems talk of difficulties in communication, misunderstanding, and hardships. Meadowlands is in some ways very funny, and others you feel for her. Gluck portrays the everyday with the mythic. We almost want to believe that the marriage she talks of in her book is like an autobiography. The poems are composed in dialogue, however there is no he said she said. It is up to the imagination of the reader to believe if it Louise or not. Everyone will agree that the dialogues in these poems are special, and emotional. The book should be read as a whole rather than in parts. 
 What on earth crawled up the lower intestinal tract of the hysterically negative reviewers of these cards?  One can only shudder and hope that it crawled out again.  I love them.  The cards, that is.  I think they're fab.  I wish these people had found another parade to sully 
 I wanna be a drag king! How cool, how fun! Great pictures and a very easy read. Buy it! be it 
 I would like to go on and on about this book and even the movie.  This is truly a moment in history that changed the sport of basketball.  A great story about a great man in a great town 
 For this book, $17.99 seems reasonable. While I applaud Mr. Lehmkuhl for bravely putting his experiences on paper, the book left the reader with more questions than it answered. You defintely get a sense of how screwed up U.S. military policy is, but after reading the disclaimer in the author's note the reader is left rather detached from the story. After all, if so many details have been changed, how can you get involved with these people's lives?  What Lehmkuhl does convey, though, is the sense of claustrophobia he must have felt keeping such a dangerous secret and not being able to live life the way he wanted to. You also get a good sense of what motivated him throughout his life from his traumatic abandonment at such a young age and his need to always prove something to others.  Fans of the Amazing Race will see a whole other side to their favorite contestant and will really empathize with the obstacles he's overcome. But the book could have been edited better (it's rife with typos and continuity issues) and it needed one more chapter to wrap things up neatly. For anyone who doesn't know anything about the military, however, this book not only is a perfect introduction into what goes on at our military academies, but it also shows how a strict set of rules can drive people to extreme measures to circumvent them 
 THE STUPENDOUS DODGEBALL FIASCO IS TOTALLY AIR HEADED AND FOR PEOPLE WHO... WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER. THIS BOOK IS BY JANICE REPKA. THE MAIN CHARACTER IS PHILLIP EDWARD STAINSLAW. HE IS A CIRCUS BOY. HE WAS ACTUALLY BORN INTO A CIRCUS. NOW I THINK THAT'S TOTALLY AWESOME AND OUTSTANDING... BUT NOT PHILLIP. HE THINKS IT'S MISERABLE. NOW I KNOW THAT MOST BOOKS START OUT WITH A BORING BEGINNING, BELIEVE ME!!! BUT NOT WITH THIS BOOK, JUST START THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE BOOK AND WALLA, IT'S CAPTURED YOUR ATTENTION. ANYWAY BACK TO THE STORY, PHILLIP'S JOB IN THE CIRCUS IS TO.... OH MY GOSH THIS IS FUNNY, HIS JOB IS TO SCOOP UP ELEPHANT DROPPINGS WITH A POOPER-SCOOPER. NOW THE PROBLEM OF THIS "STORY" OR AS I WOULD SAY IT A "COMICS" IS THAT YOUNG PHILLIP DOESN'T LIKE LIVING IN A CIRCUS AS A CIRCUS BOY. FOR HIS BIRTHDAY, WHICH JUST PASSED, HE GOT A SWALLOWING SWORD. HOW WEIRD IS THAT. MOST KIDS WANT A DIRTBIKE OR A XBOX OR VIDEO GAMES. PHILLIP GOES TO LIVE WITH HIS AUNT AND UNCLE. THATS WHERE THE REAL STORY STARTS, IN HARDINGTOWN MIDDLE SCHOOL. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS STORY TO PEOPLE WHO LIKE SPORTS AND ACTION. I WOULD RATE THIS BOOK A 5 STAR BOOK BECAUSE OF THE PLOT AND THE RESOLUTION. WHEN YOU FIND OUT THE RESOLUTION YOU WON'T PUT THIS STORY DOWN. GOOD LUCK BOOK LOVERS. THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEW  
 when i first bought this album, and listened to it i was a little skeptical. but once you listen to the lyrics, and all the instruments individually, thats when the music really comes out.  i highly recomend this to fans of FOB or just anyone. its a great albu 
 THis is a good instrumental bluegrass album. It is not as good as "ultimate Pickin'" . That was an amazing album but this isn't bad. 
 This book, with all of its scriptural references, is a real treasure and sheds brilliant light on the unique role of being a Christian wife.  I am in a 2nd marriage (married 6 months) and want very much to head this marriage down the path that God intends.  I read several passages to my husband, who is also a Christian, and he agreed that Dr. Slattery has provided accurate insights to the needs of husbands.  This book just "jumped off" the bookstore shelf. When I read the foreword and introduction to the book, I realized the challenge I have of being a woman with a strong personality who also desires to be a partner and an encourager, would be addressed in this book.  Dr. Slattery did a great job of encouraging me to be all God would have me to be while also acknowledging my husband's role as "head of our household".  Her understanding and interpretation of God's Word on this subject is encouraging and freeing!  I am purchasing additional books for my female friends and family members.  I highly recommend that wives AND their husbands read this book; it is a wonderful basis for discussion that can bring renewed energy and intimacy to a marriage 
 Well I love this book it's one of my faves.  I read it in one day and a half. It has lots of drama and action in it and the romance of course. I learned the different customs of the eastern countries and different acccents that adrianne had to use which intrested in being in drama an all. Adrianne is very clever and tough the kind of characters I like to portray and read about. Then she meets her match Phil Chamberlin. They go on the adventure of a lifetime. I would like to see this book as a movie but thats just me 
 the mohrman text is very concisely and accurately written.  very helpful diagrams and well-written (but extremely dense) text.  pretty essential for my med school physiology cours 
 This moved me more than anything comparable by Elie Wiesel, Solzhenitsyn,  or any other writer of this type of non-fiction.  i lent this book to  several friends, all were sceptical , but after reading it they agreed with  me that it was great.  Even non-reader type friends of mine got engrossed  in it.  Unfortunately one of them never gave it back to me, and its out of  print.  They need to reprint this, and fast 
 Doris Christopher has written a wonderful book.  She writes exactly how, from beginning to end, she started her company. She tells the reader her own and Pampered Chef's life story in a warm, sometimes humorous and always inspirational way.  As woman, who is trying to start her own business, I found it fascinating how Doris started with virtually nothing and was able to build her business into a huge company. I will use this book as a reference and a pick me up.  I know now, with hard work and persistence, I can make my company something I can be proud of.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.  Whether, you are starting a business of you own or just want something good to read, buy this book 
 Good combination of a conceptual framework for leading change together with practical advice. Throw in thorough research, real-life examples, and thought-provoking sidebars - and you've got a very good book 
 Just about anything Blondie is great. Just to let buyers know. Atomic and Heart Of Glass new (Diddy,etc.) mixes ARE available on CD singles. If you search for them here on Amazon you can see the tracklist and maybe find a used copy 
 This is another of those books that everyone tells you how wonderful and incredible it is. I read it, and... okay. It's a book. And a not-bad one at that. But is it amazing? Is it the greatest, most thought-provoking book of all times? Is it truly just overrated?  We have a story where it's almost as though the narrarator is not the main charactor, but rather, her father is. The story seems much more about Atticus than Scout, but that is a matter of interpertation. It's a story about racism, injustice, and thinking about all of that. Atticus is a man who goes against what the rest believes, and though he "fails", he knows that he has succeeded by making people think about the issues they are facing.  So we've covered the topic. It's an interesting topic. And the book itself has some wonderful parts, but for the most part it drags on and on.  I rate this a four because I feel that it's something everyone should read (if for some odd reason you didn't read it in high school). Whether you like it like so many others, dislike it as many teenagers who are forced to read it do, or merely feel that's it's okay, but overrated, like myself, it's worth reading, not just to find out where you fit, but also to try to see and understand why it is much loved. I myself have only just realized that everyone loves this for the fact that it tackled such social issues. It's worth reading, but not everyone should expect to find it a brilliant classic, but rather, just a good old book 
 You won't regret the time or money spent on this book. Just read it. AFTER you've read the book, watch the movie. Robin Williams is a master. There's not much more I can say, because once you experience this tale for yourself, you won't need someone else's words to describe it 
 This is an ecellent book! I have read ,many, many dog training books, -but found in this book, all the anwers to my dog training and dog behaviour questions.  I loved the training methods ,which are explained in great detail and the many anecdotes. This book is definitely going to be my new "dog bible" when I soon obtain another "bundle of joy!". 
 Their mysterious, spicy fragrances work their magic on the townfolk, and soon business is booming. This infectious novel of magic realism enchanted me with characters like the headstrong hairdresser Fiona Athey; Fr. Fergal Mahoney, the stand-up-comedian turned priest; the gentle, lonely widow Estelle Delmonico; and, of course, the three sisters themselves, whose lives they left behind in revolution-era Iran affect their present in Ireland.Mehran's book is creative and memorable. Its  rich In imagery and characters and if you like good food, and the scent of fresh herbs and spices, you'll want to walk into the Babylon Cafe and the pages of POMEGRANATE SOUP straight away. Well Don 
 Very nice. I knew after seeing the movie I'd want the soundtrack. The production work is fantastic 
 When Professor von Hardwigg discovers an ancient parchment suggesting a journey to the center of the Earth is possible, he wastes no time dragooning his dubious nephew and ward, Harry, into an expedition, first to Iceland, and then into the Earth.  Harry, a young man, sees no good that can come of this expedition, but dutifully agrees.    So begins one of the most beloved classics of science fiction ever published, Jules Verne's "A Journey to the Center of the Earth".  I'm hardly a Verne expert, but I've read many of his other classics.  "Journey" is unique among his work.  It's one of the few books to feature a first person narrator in the form of Harry.  Moreover, unlike his other books, "Journey" is less grounded in science and more interested in the fantastic.  Verne, through his various characters, slyly implores his readers' indulgence, reminding us that there is plenty about the center of the world we don't know.    Verne was an author who dealt in archetypal characters.  From "20,000 Leagues Under the Seas" on, Verne generally concentrated on three types of characters as his protagonists:  the brilliant and calm professor; the professor's loyal apprentice, and; the non-scientific, cantankerous, pragmatic, but steadfast man of action.  Here, Verne mixes and matches these traits, making for a more interesting cast.  Hardwigg is a brilliant scientist, but he's also a ball of barely restrained emotion and energy, demanding his fellow travelers press on, perhaps beyond all reason.  The man of action, the Icelandic Hans, is loyal, but by no means cantankerous.  He simply does what must be done, and is unsteady in his loyalty.  Finally, Harry, rather than the unquestioning apprentice, is quite skeptical of this expedition.  Hardly steadfast, he proves to be quite cowardly and panics at inopportune times.  Thus, with these interesting characters in the mix, the plot of the novel proves frequently unpredictable.  While the premise is fantastic, the action of the novel is far less concerned with monsters that might be found at the center of the earth than the more realistic, albeit more mundane, threats of natural disaster.  Rather than being chased by dinosaurs or hidden cave-men, our heroes must deal with being lost, the threat of starvation, underground lakes, exhaustion, and exposure.  Naturally, just as all hope seems lost for our heroes, fortune takes a hand.  Obviously, if Harry is narrating, they probably get out okay.  Still, there are some moments of true white knuckle tension, as Harry is lost in the caverns, or the trio finds itself on a raft with only a piece of jerky as their food-supply.    Wisely, Verne lets the scientific explanations he used as the basis of his other novels go here.  He's less interested in giving his reader an education in the latest discovery, and concentrates instead on a great rip-roaring read.  Admittedly, the conventions of Victorian-era fiction don't always allow the book to rip or roar.  The first third of the book is actually dedicated to getting Harry and the Professor to Iceland and recruiting an expedition.  It's more of a travelogue than an adventure tale, which makes the book more realistic, although not consistently exciting.  Once our heroes are underground, however, the book takes off.    In the grand scheme of things, "A Journey to the Center of the Earth" is probably not my favorite Verne book.  It lacks a remarkable character, like Captain Nemo.  It also lacks some of the sharper satire Verne brought to his other books, like "From the Earth to the Moon."  It doesn't quite have the pacing of "Around the World in 80 Days."  Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable and charming read, and certainly has earned its place among the classics.    
 It's Tenacious D.  You probably either love them or hate them... and personally, I love 'em!  I've been a fan for years so I couldn't wait for the movie and say it taps back into some of Jack's roots closer to his High Fidelity and Saving Silverman days than really even Nacho Libre.  Kyle FINALLY has a chance to shine on the big screen as opposed to the small cameos he's had before and I think some people underrate him as a comedian.  It's a cult movie through and through though because let's face it, not everyone can understand the levels that The D work on... I don't even think a lot of the people that do understand know why they understand at all.  It's the combination of brilliance and unbridled childishness that's often attempted, rarely pulled off, never duplicated, and built from, and to create a larger, extremely loyal fanbase 
 I searched for a long time for plates to replace our every day china (after 12 years we were down a bunch of pieces, and I didn't want to pay for the replacements).  I ordered 4 sets, loving the shape and antiquing in the photos. They got here in 3 days, not a single chip or break, the color is better (more creamy) than it looks in the picture, and I love the weight and feel of it.  There are a few minor imperfections (a very small bubble here or there), but nothing that will harm the plate or user, and I love that they are all slightly different. I ordered one set to keep aside to replace breakage (3 kids)... but I love them so much I may order another so I get a good decade out of them 
 To start, Heath Ledger oozes an Oscar worthy performance.  The character he creates is as real and authentic as they come; his way of speaking, the language he uses, BRILLIANT writing.  The inward shyness and economy with words of this humble man is enough to make you want to spend an entire day contemplating in silence.  Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was riveting and excellent as well, but the real focus is on Ledger and his character.    The scenery and cinematography is also brilliant and beautiful. The "big sky" feel, the landscape and raw nature of their surroundings lend even further into the story of this "raw" love between men.    The story itself is absolutely compelling and real.  Regardless of what you think about gay men, this is truth about what happens in the world.  It's about how people are overcome by love, and cannot reconcile it to their lifestyle or to the way of life they have known, but yet love will live on in spite of it.  It is also one of the most heartbreaking scenes when Ledger's character discovers the shirts hung together, and utters those last lines of the movie.  This movie is so fulfilling in many ways; touching, tender, compelling, REAL, and so very brilliantly acted and filmed. 
 While most sunscreens these days protect against sunburn, did you know that very few of them actually protect against photodamage? Photodamage is the damage that the sun does to your skin symptoms of which are brown spots, wrinkles and such.   Only two sunscreen ingredients protect against the long UVAI rays that cause photodamage; zinc oxide and Parsol 1789. Zinc Oxide protects a broader range of these rays than does Parsol 1789. This sunscreen has Parsol 1789 (Avobenzone). It's good, and certainly offers more photo damage protection than most, but a sunscreen with zinc oxide would be better still. Zinc Oxide is also less irritating, it's even found in some baby care products.  Because Parsol 1789 is a chemical rather than a physical sunscreen like Zinc Oxide, some may experience irritation with Neutrogena Dry Touch.  This Neutrogena goes on very smooth and dry and you can't even tell you are wearing suncscreen. This is very nice, although it does have a bit of a scent which I don't like (I would prefer it be non scented, I don't like smelling like soap-Neutrogena, are you listening?). All in all, for the money this is good sunscreen for either your face or your body and it is particularly good for oily skin as it will make your skin seem less oily.  But if you are willing to spend a bit more money, check out a zinc oxide sunscreen such as Skinceuticals Ultimate 30 which offers a bit more protection and is less irritating (zinc oxide is less irritating that Parsol 1789). And most certainly at least get a sunscreen with Parsol 1789 such as this one 
 I really congratulate the author on maintaining this edition fresh. I actually come from an IT Systems and apps area.When I had to take the deep dive into Telecom and specially into SS7 I was suggested Russels 2nd edition and thats all that I needed to jump in.Simple, crisp and great images.  With the 5th edition I just moved into 3 major telco projects in NGN and the book was just what I needed.  Cheers - anirudha Sharma Caracas Venezuela 
 Berry writes in a very eloquent and poignant manner to enlighten readers about the big American misconception that modern agriculture and technology is the only way to prosper.  It's time for education, politics, and the public make intelligent decisions based on real consequences that affect the land, our health, and common bonds, and to look beyond the narrow minded system of profits and production.  I recommend this book to any person who cares about the environment, agriculture, and public policy 
 I love Mexican folk art, so when I saw this book I immediately ordered it.  It is so much fun!  The ideas are presented as how-to projects.  If you like step by step directions, you will love the way the projects are laid out.  However, if you're like me and never color in the lines, the book is an excellent spring board for creating your own versions of the projects in the book.  The great thing about this book is that she gives an extensive "where to buy" section.  Many of them are online sources, so if you don't live in the southwest, you can still play!  La Casa Loca is the most inspiring book I've bought in a long time 
 This is a fantastic album, but you can read the other reviews to find out why.  My problem is the album needs to be remasterd. If you listen to "Very Best of the Stone Roses" (which is remastered and recommended as an introduction to the Stone Roses) the difference is night and day and difficult to listen to the original albums songs that overlap (which is quite a number). I would also suggest adding some bonus tracks such as the Peter Hook (of New Order) produced version of "Elephant Stone" which makes an already great song even better (available on Very Best) and some era B-Sides especially "Mersey Paradise" the best Stone Roses song not on this album (and good enough alone to warrant a purchase of Turns Into Stone). 
 As stated by prior reveiwers, this books does assume that the reader is Mathematically mature (a saying most young Mathematicians despise), in the sense that he/she must be able to follow the logical development of any given arguement, be able to 'see' where and how topics are related as well as fill in any blanks that may present themsevles in a given definition/proof.  Apostol, as compared to Rudin, does a nice job of filling in these blanks by adequately providing all of the necessary details within a proof.  This book will provide the willing student with a solid foundation in elementary analysis as well as the confidence to persue higher analysis.  The only draw back to Apostols book, aside from cost, is that the constant Theorem - Proof - Theorem format can be overwhelming at times and cause some readers to cover material too quickly.  Despite the book's cost I would highly recommend this book over "baby" Rudin (that is, Principles of Mathematical Analysis) since Rudin is notorious for not filling in the blanks within a given proof and instead provides seemingly 'slick proofs' 
 We enjoyed reading all of Dave Pelzer's books.  Excellent reading for all 
  Episodes 11-15. Unfortunately, these episodes wane a bit from the first 10, yet I can't feel that these episodes are the final set-up for the second half of the first season. First, you are going to get blown away when you meet "the human form" of Blue (previously the dog of the wolf hunter, now running with the pack). The next three episodes barely concentrate on the main charactors, Kiba, Tsume, Hige and Tolboy, and more concentrate on the lives of Cheir (the female scientist in search of Cheza), and her ex-husband, Hub (the detective). Also included is some of the background of the wolf hunter. I won't give it away, but the final episode winds up with the most important event of the series. Like I say, the bulk of these episodes concentrates on the developement of the side charactors; therefore, this string of episodes will be important to understanding the rest of the series. Thoug not as involved or entertaining as the rest of the series, "Loss" is well worth the price, and is a must own in one of the best anime series ever created. Do not begin with this disk. Buy "Leader of the Pack", and "Blood and Flowers" first. I may sound a little down on this disk, but overall, "Wolf's Rain", in terms of story line, animation, sound track and everything else is absolutely one of the best series ever made, animated or live action 
 I graduated from high school in 1986, so how could I not be a Duran Duran fan?  But their late 80s/early 90s stuff never held as much appeal to me, and my interest in the band faded over the years.  Happily, this amazing collection of their "Greatest" has rekindled my enthusiasm for this awesome group and their unique sound.    I attribute my love of these CD in large part to the masterful sequencing of the songs.  "Is There Something I Should Know?" is not necessarily one of my top picks, but it definitely start things off right with its catchy beat.  The strong rhythms continue with the next two tunes, "The Reflex" and "A View to a Kill" (I always find that the latter stays in my head for days afterward).  Then, the tone of the album changes with the moody "Ordinary World," an offering from 1993's altered band that I had previously ignored but am now quite partial too, and "Save a Prayer," a sentimental favorite.  Several other songs from the mega-hit album Rio come next, followed by the best two tracks from their very first album, "Girls on Film" and "Planet Earth."    By this point in the CD (about halfway through), I don't even mind that there are four songs in a row from the previously-dreaded late 80s/early 90s era.  The next five tunes are all more recent (1990s/2000) offerings, and to my surprise, I found each one of these to be incredibly fun, upbeat, and amazingly familiar, although there were actually two that I hadn't heard before ("All She Wants Is" and "Electric Barbarella," a homage to the movie which gave the band its name).  Finally, the compilation draws to a close with "Come Undone," another gem from the group's 1983 incarnation.  If you are a fan of Duran Duran in any way, shape, or form, don't hesitate to buy this CD--I promise, you will not be disappointed 
 In a sea of academic self-help and personal essays, James Lang's account of his first tenure-track experience is -- thankfully -- more of a token from a companion than a mentor. It rings true to life as a college professor, quirks and foibles included, and humanely regarded. If anything else, his personable ethos makes for an comforting time with a friend, which is to be appreciated. 
 This book has alot of great recycling gift idea that can save you alot of money, plus save our  landfills. Keep up the good work Leisure Arts 
 This was, by far, one of the most inspirational books I have ever read. The ramifications of this book have had far reaching effects on all aspects of my life. This is a must read for anyone going through a custody dispute. The author really knew what she was talking about 
 JA Jance has witten another excellent book in the Joanna Brady series.  I can't wait for the next one 
 This is the most used cookbook in my house.  It features simple to find and use ingredients and all recipes are quick and tasty, not to mention quite healthy.  I have given this book out as gifts to two others already and they both have given it similar reviews 
 Hyrum Smith does an excellent job portraying the tools we all need to use in our life if we are to succeed.  As I just happen to live in the same area as he does it would be wonderful to run into him someday.  Most of the material he's used in this book has been used (either books or tapes) by him before.  However, like any positive material, it is all worth repeating.  The only drawback to this book (four stars) is that it dwells so much on Hyrums experiences- rather than giving usable advice to its readers (the old WIIFM).  This book did leave me with the warm fuzzies, which by the way, is one of the ways I rate a book.  If you are a reader of self-help books, this is a winner 
 My interest first came to this film when I was flicking through the pages of my Fangoria magazine, and  there was an interveiw with the Director, but the article mentioned 'Jack Frost' and an unknown Shannon Elizabeth getting raped by a killer snowman. I thought ''What the hell'', but I was interested. Then I saw it at my local video store and I didn't grab it right away, I kept thinking ''This film is going to be bad, but I wanna see it''. So I finally hired it and the first time one watches it, you think ''Oh this is soooo bad, but funny in a dumb way. But there is something about it. Then I watched it again and I got more into it, by the third viewing I'm totally into it now.  This movie rocks. It actually is a good, interesting, funny film if you just embrace what is happening and the humour along with it.  I totally recommend this film, though the first time viewing it you might not like it as much as viewing it the second time.  -Chrismas came early for this one 
 Silence is an excellent book based on the trials of a Catholic Priest attempting to do missionary work in Japan in the early 17th century. This was a time of persecution an tribulation for Christians in Japan as the Government had decided that Christianity could no longer be allowed to flourish in the country.   The Japanese took great pains to stamp out Christians, using torture to force padres and Christians alike to apostatize, and trample a fumie in order to prove their apostasy. It was a brutal time for Japanese Christians as well as the Priests who attempted to lead them.   In the end, Father Sebastian Rodrigues, the main character, must make some increasingly difficult decisions and come to some difficult conclusions concerning his faith and his God. I highly recommend this book, as it was very moving. I think it will strike a particular chord w/Christians especially, but recommend it for everyone 
 Overall, it was a good book, with a good story. My only complaint is the author. He trys to be like one of those "cool" writers, seeing the words he uses and such, but he's so not, if you read the "About the author" section, and look at his picture. Kind of like one of those 12 year old girls who try to imitate Hilary Duff. 
 Jeremy Naydler has rescued the deep wisdom of Egypt - experiential insight into the deeper reality and how we can travel there for initiation and empowerment - from the Egyptologists. For all of us who have long suspected, or remembered, that the palace tombs and pyramid texts of Egypt are about much, much more than funerary arrangements, here is ringing confirmation that the Egyptians traveled beyond the gates of death while very much alive, not only to bring back first-hand knowledge of the afterlife, but to enter into sacred union with the gods and enthrone their power in the body, and so acquire the spiritual and sexual potency to marry the worlds. Shamanic Wisdom of the Pyramid Texts is a splendid melding of fine scholarship and passionate engagement with themes that are vitally important to us today. It is must reading not only for lovers of Egypt, students of shamanism and religion, and modern practitioners of soul travel, but for all of us who hunger for the real history of humanity's encounters with the more-than-huma 
 The main point the authors try to make is that typically in merger and acquisition situations corporate culture of the parties involved is not studied as methodically as legal, fiscal issues and other hardware issues.  Their Cultural Due Diligence Model aims to add an invaluable element to the process by focusing proactively on corporate culture at the planning, implementation and post merger stages of the merger. They also show the post-merger Cultural Integration and Alignment process detailing what to do after the merger is announced. Though it may seem like a typical `consultant' tool at first glance, the Organizational System Scan Model can be a handy tool if it is utilized at the planning stages of M&A.  Designed to be a hands-on resource, Achieving Post-Merger Success and the accompanying CD-ROM have many operational-level tools, checklists, case studies, worksheets, and samples which can be useful tools for organizations to minimize culture clash and integration problems. Some more examples like the British Airways example would have aided the reader see the reality in actual M&A situations. The authors also assume that the tools provided are valid universally irrespective of national culture. This delinking corporate culture from national culture can be very misleading and potentially dangerous. In reality many of the tools e.g., staff involvement day, where one gives feedback and advice to own boss and the CEO would cause confusion and distress in many cultures. In many cultures people simply answer politely and 360 degree feedbacks would give a false sense of security. In spite of these shortcomings, this is a valuable book for people planning and overseeing corporate mergers 
 If you've got a nice, sunshiny yard, why not gussy it up a little with one of the contemporary curtain ensembles that decorators now call, window treatments? I found Creative Publishing's guide to be insightful and a true resource, it's good even with the basement windows that my X put inwhile trying to give a basement woodshop some natural light, but on the other hand nosy neighbors mean that you have to have some cloth over the glass.    Whether your view overlooks a garden in the country, or St. Patrick;s Cathedral in the city, you'll want a book like this here "More Creative Window Treatments" so you can look at the color photos and decide for yourself, and for your family, which setting would look nicest. And then the book gives you complete instructions for how to sew it together yourself. Or perhaps you can enlist the assistance of the birds and mice Disney's Cinderella used to help her whip together her gown 
 L.A. Woman by The Doors *****  The Doors are one of those bands that in my book can do little wrong. Almost everything the critics said effected their music I only think made it better. The seemed to get better with every album they made or at the least more experimental and creative. The Doors will always be high on my list of the all time greatest bands. Easily in the top ten. L.A. Woman is in my opinion one of the bands all time best albums, more blues then the others, yet still psychedelic and full of great lyrics, musician ship, and of course passion for the music they were playing. On this album I think Robbie Krieger's guitar playing was at an all time best along with his song writing. Ray Manzerek's keys are amazing as always adding nice textures to the songs, and John Densmore's jazzy drumming fits perfectly. Jim's voice sounds amazing here and his lyrics are astounding as always.  The album starts of with `The Changeling' which is a heavy blues song that contains some of Jim Morrison's all time best vocals. definitely the very best song to open the album. `Love Her Madly' is one of the biggest hits the band ever had and is one of their most recognizable classics. Great acoustic guitars and awesome lyrics by the great Robbie Krieger. The song sounds very 1960's and very cool. `Been Down So Long' is a nice song with killer guitar playing by Robbie Krieger. The slide guitar solo reminds me of the late Duane Allman at the height of his playing, very good indeed. The lyrics are nice and blues and it's a very cool song to just sit back on and listen to, one of my favorites on the album. Next is the nice slow blues of `Cars Hiss By My Window.' While I think it is the weakest song on the album I do think it is still a very good song. It's the kind of song you would love to listen to while relaxing. The guitar as again is superb. The drumming is nothing special but it works perfect for the song. The lyrics are perfect, classic blues lyrics all the way which make this an excellent song.   The title track is next. `L.A. Woman' is one of the greatest songs ever written, it is as simple as that! Easily the best song on the album, and one of The Door's all time best. Jim Morrison's lyrics are the stuff of legend. Perfect, and his vocal performance is brilliant. Manzerek keys are great, Densmore's quick beats keep the song on a rollin.' Robbie Kriegers all time best guitar playing is here. Forget `The End' `Light My Fire' and `When The Music Is Over.' This song alone shows what an underrated guitarist he is, truly one of the best!		  `L'America' sounds like Door's of old. Very 1960's and very psychedelic. The track sounds very spacey and out of this world. Nothing very special but still a pretty cool song. `Hyacinth House' is another song that sounds like something from earlier Door's albums like Waiting For The Sun. It's a nice song with self pitting lyrics by Morrison and great guitar from Krieger. `Crawling King Snake' is a John Lee Hooker cover, which the boys pull off wonderfully. I think it is actually better then the original which is saying a lot because the original is a classic which influenced many people to pick up playing guitar. `The Wasp (Texas Radio And The Big Beat)' is a killer song and I never understood how it didn't become a hit single. The song is just out of this world, it truly is one of the best songs the band ever recorded. The album comes to a climactic close with one of the bands most memorable songs, the classic `Riders On The Storm.' Amazing production, rain falling in the background, great keys, wonderful vocals and lyrics. This mellow/eerie haunting song is about a killer is the best song to close the album. It's eerie how the song about a killer closed the bands final album.  While L.A. Woman is certainly not the bands best album it is one of their best. Concerned by many to be one of the all time greatest albums in rock and roll history.  It's just a sham this was the bands final album because this shows you where they were headed and it could have been amazing 
 ive seen alot of anime, but el hazard has to be one of the best. my only regret is that it was so good that it ended too soon. if ur looking for something with humor action and even some romance, i highly recomend el hazard 
 I have to admit, I liked the original "The Talented Mr. Ripley" more, but this was still a fascinating book at what motivates people to commit murder. We have a dying man, who slighted Tom Ripley, and is now fingered by Ripley and a friend to go kill some Mafia figures. Money that might not be tempting in ordinary circumstances becomes reason enough at the prospect of dying and leaving his family destitute. What I liked was that Jonathan didn't jump up to do the murder, nor have a sudden change of heart. He was sort of swept up in the whole thing. And what is interesting is that Tom comes as close to forgiving as a psychopath is capable--he did come to Jonathan's rescue more than once. A complex game, indeed, with an ending that will keep you guessing right to the end. It does leave me wondering, though, how does Tom keep getting away with murder 
 From a George Bush perspective, I read.  Hence, I must be a   Revolutionary. But for me reading is essentail. In Rafael's book, "Scaramouche", the establishment games the system by dueling the people's representatives with their skillfully commissioned swords. They literally kill the people's will.  Today's fait accomplis are the skillfully commissioned penned instruments called NAFTA and WTO. The perpetrators behind these instruments  were a political crew of bloodsuckers. On the American side they included: Robert Rubin, Bill Clinton, Alan Greenspan, Lawrence Summers, Al Gore and Henry Kissinger. These penned agreements were inserted with poison pills designed to adversely effect constitutiions throughout the world, including ours. But you'll never hear a discouraging word about them from the corporate mainsteam news. Get the REAL down and dirty of globalization and read "THE Global Class War".  Read it and weep... for those you had placed your trust in, and to the republic they signed off on. Learn to distinguish between the interests of stateless transnationals and we the people whose economic fate is bounded by the nation.  The poor class has already lost what little they had. Now the middle class is in the cross hairs and slowly being squeezed out. Unfortunately, they have taken us all aboard their hellbound corporate express called the bottom line.  A must read for those who want the truth.    
 I found this book by accident online. After reading the first chapter I was hooked. Read the entire story in a 2 day period. It was THAT good. I would recommend this book to any and all Zombie lovers. Thanks Mr.Wellington, I am loving Frostbite 
 I like the quote by Andreas Scholl printed on the outside of the record jacket: "There is more to heroism than winning fearlessly.  My heroes have moments of weakness and must overcome their difficulties." There is no doubt that when he chose the selections for this disc he had this thought in mind.  Heroes such as Jupiter in 'Semele' who praised his lover Semele with the lovely 'Where'er You Walk' and at the end killed her (nice guy)- Bertarido in 'Rodelinda' singing 'Vivi,tiranno'after killing a mobster(justifably) and then refusing to kill the 'ringleader'- Orfeo in'Orfeo and Euridice' singing a song of longing for his wife after sending her back to death by making a huge error- and David in 'Saul' singing 'O Lord, Whose Mercies Numberless' one minute asking God to help Saul and afterward hating and fearing him.  Scholl handles all of  these situations pretty much in character. His voice, as always, is clear reflecting the fact that his training even thuout his 'changing' voice at puberty was always geared to the head voice.  His teacher cleverly detected that that was his best voice.  Of course, the English for centuries have known this and followed thru producing such excellent countertenors as Bowman,Chance,Blaze etc.  This is a very exciting and entertaining group of arias well worth the purchase 
 I have not read this book but I did attend a workshop with Dr. Countryman where he read from a manuscript of this book.  The manuscript material was very good, especially his discussion of the sprituality of John Donne and George Herbert.  After hearing Dr. Countryman I have developed a new facet of my own spirituality which is the use of poetry.  I am sure that you will not be disappointed with this book 
 Lindsey Davis' Marcus Didius Falco series of murder mysteries set in ancient Rome (AD 70-73) is spot-on. Besides being riveting mystery novels, Davis' historical knowledge is both extensive and up-to-date. (I should  know. I have recently received a doctorate in Roman history and am whiling  away the long wait for an academic post.) "Fountain" offers an  almost painless introduction to the supposedly tedious subject of Roman  aqueducts and water management. In the novels, obscure facts of Roman  history (such as the organization of the vigiles, Rome's firemen and  police, or the Maiuma, a religious carnival involving nude bathing - in  "Palmyra") come alive. What's more, Davis does this with humor  and a light touch. She completely undercuts the supposedly stuffy image of  the ancient Romans with Falco's irreverent perspective. Davis is 1000 times  better than Colleen McCullough's bloated "First Man in Rome"  series 
 this is one of the best toys I've baught for my daughte 
 Every bar in the world will tell you it's 5 p.m. somewhere if you want to buy a drink at 10 a.m. in the morning and say it's too early-- many folks say that Jimmy Buffett is responsible for that line-- it's 5 pm. somewhere in the world!. The book I got had a new preface by the author whose tales are just amazing...cowboy culture from HEartache Wyoming to Graceland with Tully Mars...singer, songwriter/author Buffet is a legend in his own time. I like this one even better than his autobiography a pirate turns 50 -- his stories sing with romance, adventure and a sense of saltiness that goes beyond Lake Wobegon sameness. It's so much fun-- men and women will love this book. Not because it's full of insight or soul searching but because it's FUN. Great read on an airplane, Fun to keep in your closet for a guest visitor and maybe the perfect book to take on a cruise with you. Or a busride or train ride around the country. Fabulous tales....I wish he could tell one to me why I drink a Margarita -- you could be any age to read the book -- but if you're over 40 you may find a certain understanding of what it means to be moving on in life and still young enough to care about romance and the unknown. Good book to read when you're changing your life -- changing jobs, got fired, moving, or yearn to -- try this book for a break from the same old. 
 This is a stunning book!! It is a treat to sit down and get lost in the  creative genious of Ron Morgan and the sensitivity of the photographer. I purchased this as a present for a friend, but will be purchasing another for myself 
 This book is such a refreshing break from the Martha Stewart-style tomes on home decor and management.  Granted, it's not an in-depth account of how-tos; it's not supposed to be!  It's a tongue-in-cheek, girl-power, do-it-with-panache look at modern home care.  If you're looking for the perfect new homeowner book for your newlywed friends, this is it.  By the way...the recipes for Cowboy Cookies and the lasagna (so simple!) are worth the price alone. My husband starts panting when he sees I've got the recipe out. 
 I just loved this DVD.  I really enjoyed the live performances and the behind the scenes stuff.  I definitely agree with a lot of the reviewers out there, this DVD does tell you more about Edwin and does show his sense of humor.  I really want to see him live sometime.  The only disappointment I had is I wish there were more music videos on there, but all the other things that were on the DVD made up for that for the most part.  Overall, an enjoyable DVD 
 Here is a significant piece of history, which is re-created with all the workings of a play. The last 100 days of the second world war in Europe will be long remembered after you have read this book. Here we have Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill at the Yalta conference, the bombing of Dresden, Himmler's attempt to "save" the Jews in the Nazi death camps, Benito Mussolini murdered by vengeful Italians with the faithful Clara Petacci, and the suicide and ghastly cremation of Adolf Hitler, the "vilest tormentor of mankind." Read it, sit back, and enjoy it 
 Are you as depressed about the current state of affairs concerning the future of the U.S. constitution, in particular the Bush administration's seeming attempts to dissolve the separation of church and state?  Do you get angry when Christian right revisionists attempt to convince the public that there was no such thing in the first place?  Well, my hell-bound friends, have I got a book for you!  Susan Jacoby's meticulously researched, insightful, and yes, even fair and balanced history of the most despised, yet also most important people in our nation's history is a clarion call that needs to be heard.  Atheists, agnostics and other assorted doubters have been around for as long as others attempted to pass off absurd fairy tales as inerrant fact, but it wasn't until the enlightment that anything like a real "movement" emerged, and not until the founding of the United States, still ironically the most religious nation on earth, has this movement been able to enact any positive changes.  The founding fathers were far from perfect men--Jefferson held abotitionist views but still kept and even impregnated one of his slaves--but they understood that a nation built on people from disparate backgrounds, that is, a plurality, must have a public square where even the most controversial opinions can be aired without fear of reprisals.  Since religion is the most personal and intractable opinion a person can have, none of these beliefs can be codified into law, lest those with a different set of beliefs be harmed.  Therefore, it's up to people whose beliefs aren't hidebound to a single creed--freethinkers--have the responsility to protect the secular public square--for the good of all, including the most religious and even anti-religious among us.  Naturally, this core value of Democracy has been under assault ever since by fundamentalists who believe their way is the only way--for everybody.  In "Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism" Ms. Jacoby offers the stories of those brave and flawed individuals who have helped make this a great nation, even if almost none of today's political representatives would acknowledge it.  Aside from Jefferson, whose "godless constitution" continues to protect all Americans more forcefully than any "Patriot Act," there was Thomas Paine, the author of "The Age of Reason," who was ruthlessly stigmatized for his independence.  Ernestine L. Rose, a Jewish immigrant and abolitionist orator, one of the few activists of the nineteenth century to proudly label herself an atheist, proved that a true moral and ethical system could be freed from dogma and the supernatural.  Lucretia Mott (a devout if rebellious Quaker), Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony laid the framework for women's suffrage and feminism.  Then there's Robert Ingersol, a prominent lawyer and orator, nicknamed "the Great Agnostic," whose charisma and lucidity helped to foster the various freethinking groups that exist to this day.  Even though he often spoke to crowds who you might think would be hostile to his views, he attained a popularity that would be unheard of today, when statements of faith are de rigeur in order to be elected to almost any political position.    Today's freethinkers have pretty much given up on trying to change people's minds, for fear that they'd be considered proseletysers.  As science and reason continue to advance in the rest of the world, threatening to leave America behind, this book is an important reminder of the leadership role we once played.  While Ms. Jacoby wears her sympathies and even her politics on her sleeve--she ignores the roles played by more libertarian freethinkers such as H.L. Mencken and Ayn Rand--she never overestimates the importance of her subjects, even though they're almost always underestimated these days.  Atheists, agnostics and all stripes of freethinkers have been at the leading edge of the most important social advances of the last 200 years, even if they needed to be joined by religious liberals in order to truly achieve their goals.  Maybe this book can help inspire the next evolution (that's right, evolution--it really happens) of freethought for the benefit of everybody, including those who will continue to bask in the comforting but blinding artificial light of faith 
 this,is a great,album!robbie who?it's just a shame,it isn't, a double album!hopefully,there's more,like this coming,from the band?any chance,of a tour 
 Like many of the other reviewers, I started reading a copy of this book in my parents' library when I was very young, maybe 8 or 9.  I started with the jokes and, as I grew older, graduated to the more complex stories.  My favorite part was always the stories of the wonder-working rabbis, especially the Spanish rabbi who tried to bring about the coming of the Messiah.    I read this book over and over and over through my teenage years, and many years later, when I was in my 40s, I finally bought my own copy.  Upon this later re-reading, I was able to recognize how internalized these stories had become, a part of my own intellectual landscape.  I'm not particularly observant, and I definitely fall into the Heritage Jew not Religious Jew category.  But these stories fulfill needs for both types.  There can be few better ways to explore the heritage of my people than by dipping into the stories included here.  All the humor, cleverness, courage, scholarship, and mysticism associated with Jews and Judaism through the centuries--if not the millennia--may be found herein.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough for Jews, and I believe that non-Jews will find it a fascinating and accessible window into an oft-misunderstood or underestimated people 
 The reference to swallows in the title of this remarkable novel is to the burqa-clad women of Afghanistan during the years of the Taliban. Swathed in fabric from head to toe, they have been forced from public life and, as much as possible, rendered invisible, to preserve their "purity" and the honor of their families. The French-Algerian author, Khadra, heightens the incomprehensibility of this kind of faith-based segregation of genders even further by beginning and ending his story with the public executions of two women, one for alleged adultery and the other for the alleged murder of her husband.  Between these two incidents, the story follows the daily lives of several characters living out lives of soul-crushing misery in the doomed and ruined city of Kabul. There is a jail keeper, a university-educated man, an aged man who dreams of escape, and a Kalashnikov-carrying militiaman who turns a blind eye to the inhumanity he witnesses and looks only for opportuniies to advance his own career. It is a violent, Orwellian world where empathy has died and only the self-serving survive.  Both spare and unsparing, Khadra's writing brings to mind the stark, unsentimental vision of Camus' "The Stranger." The book is a bleak portrayal of exteme Islamic fundamentalism and as such seems intended as a heart-rending call of compassion for those in war-devastated regions, who are trapped by its worst excesses 
 I thought Ms. Kirkland's book was a good glimpse into her everyday life as well as her mind and what being at the top of a top ballet company in the 80's was like.  
 This book deals with something I've wondered about for a long time: the seemingly religious aspects of (pop) cultural ideas, images, totems, rituals, etc., and in particular, the role of human imagination, and in many cases, deliberate fraud, in creating a backdrop of meaning for life.   While the book is a pleasurable read, it does maintain a certain level of erudition, stylistically. It also manages to remain focused and serious while allowing in just the right amount of good humour and whimsy.   I especially liked the discussions on baseball and Jim Jones; after reading this, I'll be ordering Chidester's book on the Jonestown suicide.   Thumbs up 
 I love this book! It's great! For those people who ran out of clay, try White Rose or Michaels for Sculpey III, or any well-stocked craft store would have it. BYE 
 This coffee is awesome!  The aroma and taste are like a little bit of heaven for a french roast aficionado like me!  The price is great and the shipping is quick.  I am  really glad to see that it is organic as well.  This sure leaves that pricey brand in the dust 
 This is an excellent reference book on photography.  It covers noted photographers, photographic history, photographic theories, and a great deal more.  Oxford Companion books are well known for their exceptionally good quality.  The section on digital imaging, for example, is one of the best I have ever read.    Please note that this is a reference book.  It is not designed to teach photography.  However, any serious photographer or photography student will find this book useful.  This book would also make a superb gift for anyone interested in photography 
 it is a book of calling. he or she who this book happened to get to them somehow do read it... it is an invtation. invitation to the deep truth inside us it has really the energies of an invitation so if these words find you and make you feel you are invited... do so just looking at the author's picture makes a healing inside me seems it is worth of knowing her lots of love to al 
 I think it good for kid because it keeps them bess.I get very bored on a plane when it is a long trip. I got this book thinking it would be good and it was.I think if you are bored on trips on a plane it is a good choose 
 The author's own very personal story of healing & growth through imagery and the art process, combined with a very clear, present-moment style of writing was absolutely riveting to me! This is a living, pulsing and highly moving, inspired and inspiring work. I couldn't put it down 
 Awesome movie.  You are really on the edge of your seat the whole time.  (I had to watch a comedy after I was so stressed!)You really have no idea what will happen next as the plot thinkens and twists.  Great, grerat movie 
 Petrosyan studied Nimzovich's games.  Petrosyan was World Champion before Spassky.  Petrosyan defeated Botvinnik, and lost to Spassky.  There have been other books on Petrosyan.  An older volume was written by O'Kelly.   His style:  Petrosyan was known for his draws.  On several occasions he showed an attacking style.   Such as one game where he sacrificed his queen.   As for the above post: Götterdämmerung (help·info) ("Twilight of the Gods" - see Notes) is the last of the four operas that comprise Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung), by Richard Wagner. It received its premiere at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus on 17 August 1876, as part of the first complete performance of the Ring.  The title is a translation into German of the Old Norse phrase Ragnarok, which in Norse mythology refers to a prophesied war of the gods which brings about the end of the world in Völuspá. However, as with the rest of the Ring, Wagner's account of this apocalypse diverges significantly from his Old Norse sources. The term Götterdämmerung is occasionally used in English, referring to a disastrous conclusion of events.   Raymond Keene.  I would recommend any book written by Raymond Keene.  He writes in a clear manner. Another volume for consideration would be his book on Nimzovitch's games.  Note that Petrosyan studied Nimzovitch's games as well 
 The introduction of the theory of constraints through the book "The Goal" by Eli Goldratt, was like a rebirth in business analysis for me.  Goldratt's book tickled my interest in learning more.  Mr. Dettmer's book,  Breaking the Constraints to World-Class Performance, is like a text book  explaining the steps it takes to analyze problems using the TOC theory.   The book makes you stop generalizing and start looking for specifics...each  step of the way can be analyzed by management teams or employee groups to  arrive at some consensus.  A very highly readable book with a ton of  information....the information isn't easy to implement, but it is  surprising the solutions one comes up with 
 What can I say beside Madone!! I grew up in the bronx and have traveled the world. Now, I live in upstate NY I have been married for 20 years and love my wife but she can't cook...until now, she bought "Shut Up And Eat" and thats what I do I shut Up Eat and read all of my favorite stars stories..wow I feel like I grew up with them....... I just ordered 11 more for christmas presents!!! ho ho h 
 If you are a dog lover, I recommend you buy this book. I also recommend you read it in private so you can cry in peace. It is a beautifully written account of the last day of a Golden Retriever who's family is giving him one special day before he must take one last trip to the vet. Written from the perspective of Jasper's "boy", it is heart warming and realistic in dealing with the pain of losing a beloved dog

 "I confess" (1953) is a film that is difficult to watch, but also regarding. This is not my favorite Hitchcock film, but I am glad I saw it, even though at times it was hard to endure all the things the main character had to go through in order to stay true to his beliefs.  The main character is Father Logan (Montgomery Clift), a priest that becomes the main suspect of a crime. He knows who the real murderer is, but cannot tell that to the police due to the fact that he had been told that in a confession. As circumstantial evidence condemns him, and people accuse him of shameful deeds, will Father Logan tell what he knows, or will he go on suffering, keeping the secret of confession ?  Montgomery Clift is perfect in his portrayal of Father Logan, a man of integrity faced with a crisis of conscience in a very trying situation. You cannot help being affected by the moral dilemma that Father Logan faces, because Clift conveys his anguish and sadness extremely well. You end up asking yourself a very difficult question: what would you do if you were in his place?  "I confess" (1953)  is a beautiful film about difficult choices, and staying true to what we believe in. Even though most of this movie is pretty somber, the ending brings a note of hope that leaves the spectator thoughtful but not sad. Of course, recommended...  Belen Alca 
 I had gotten a new bandsaw for christmas and I was a bit on the stumped side on what to do, since it had been 20 years since the last time I had used a bandsaw. Starting looking for a good book and found this one. I am glad I got it, gave the good headstart I needed especially with things like tuning, jig making, and overall knowledge of this particular piece of equipment 
 Readers who have seen John M. Floyd's work in popular magazines like Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine, and Woman's World will know what a talented writer he is.  So it will be no mystery to them that they're in for a treat with "Word Games".  Cleve Decker is a real estate agent.  His receptionist, Jenny, is visited by a spooky woman by the name of Jeanine Broussard.  Apparently Jeanine wants to pay back her recently deceased husband's long standing debt to Decker's late father.  The gift comes in the form of two words that Decker can say which will cause an interesting thing to happen.  The gift can be used repeatedly to help Decker out of difficult situations.  In true John M. Floyd style, this tale has a good little twist in it.  The story itself reminds me of some of the better short stories I used to read by famous authors in my English literature books.  You know the kind, the kind you were actually glad to read and reread.  Upon finishing "Word Games", you'll probably take a few moments to wonder about the story that's bound to occur after the story.  To me, this is a sign of a well told tale.  This story gets 5 stars from me 
 Jenna doesn't do well in school, and she isn't happy with the fact that she is so tall.  Her little sister is the beautiful one in the family.  Jenna does have one talent, though.  She is excellent at selling.  Specifically, she is excellent at selling shoes, which is her part-time job.  She loves working at Gladstone's shoe store, a store that prizes quality service and quality products.  This summer it seems that Jenna's life is about to become more complicated.  Her alcoholic father, often gone for years at a time, is back in town and trying to get in touch with Jenna.  Jenna knows that means he will be calling at all hours after he has been drinking and showing up to see her at work and at home.  She doesn't know how she will handle him this time.  Then a wonderful opportunity presents itself.  The aging president of the company, a grumpy woman who can't seem to accept that she is getting older, needs to travel extensively to visit some of her shoe stores and attend important meetings.  She doesn't like to fly, so she needs someone to drive her across the country.  She takes a liking to Jenna and, surprisingly enough, Jenna's mom agrees to let her go.  Thus starts an adventure Jenna would never have dreamed.  Mrs. Gladstone is grumpy and snappy, but Jenna begins to really like her and even learns how to talk her into things.  On this trip Jenna learns that Mrs. Gladstone's son is trying to take over the company and turn it into a discount place that sells substandard shoes.  Mrs. Gladstone isn't sure she can stop her son from taking over.  But Jenna is pretty sure she can, and is willing to do whatever it takes to help.  I really liked the relationship between Jenna and Mrs. Gladstone.  They were both strong and stubborn, and balanced each other well.  I also liked that Jenna's home life wasn't perfect and her mother had a good reason for sending her on this trip.  It was a well-written story of personal growth 
 I love their movies together.  This is a wonderful gift for a true fan 
 This is a funny and touching movie at times.  I saw the American re-hash of it but it didn't traslate as well to baseball.   As this is Nick Hornby's autobiography how could it.  He's English and an Arsenal fan.  It's a shame this movie will not be seen in the States.  Whoever made the decision to change it to an American version did a gross mis-service to this film.  I have found American audiences to be very receptive to British movies 
 In Panther, Thom did what he does best.  He takes characters from history, erases them from the beautiful lithographs in our textbooks, and shows us their human side. Having done so, he then restores their demigod-like qualities by fitting them into the lifestyle of their era and showing us how they struggled and suffered to reach their goal.  History books may say, for instance, that "they made an arduous journey...". Thom carries you every step of the way; the freezing, bloody, bare feet, the starvation & deprivation, the determination to reach the end that earned these people their places in history.  To read Thom's works is to know his people, our icons 
 One of the best gothic bands, if you like stuff like TRISTANIA, NIGHTWISH, WITHIN TEMPTATION, THETRE OF TRAGEDY AND OTHER BANDS WITH FEMALE VOCALS, THIS IS FOR YOU. Beautiful fem. voice and powerful strong music background 
 The author examines the anthropological, sociological and ethnomusicological aspects of World Music.  This is an essential text to the introduction of world music.  
 It may come as a shock, but I always suspected that something's not quite right with Snape. Well, we'll see what happens next.. 
 Along with the EXCELLENT Amazon service, this Pill Book is the 5th or 6th one we've purchased in our 46 years together, as we keep up with new additions.  Natureally, we are using MORE medicines, now, and The Pill Book keeps us up on all we want to know about them 
 I really enjoyed the way the director incorporated the play, which the movie was based on, into the movie. The acting was great, and the love story was touching. I loved to see a real life lesbian couple playing the roles based on a real life account of their own story. Dom Deluise and Mink Stole were hilarious, and I highly recommend this movie 
 On reading Exceeding Customer Expectations, I was very positively struck by the well defined, actionable and insightful "lessons learned" that can be applied to any business/industry. While employing a relatively straightforward business model and corporate philosophy, Enterprise inspires and engenders loyalty in a customer base that returns on a regular basis.  The superior service that those customers enjoy then leads to the best advertising of all - word of mouth testimonials to fellow customers/consumers who have a myriad of choices but who ultimately choose Enterprise.  Bravo to Enterprise and to author Kazanjian for bringing forward this success story in Exceeding Customer Expectations!    
 WATER is a rare movie that succeeds in being many things at the same time. It's a love story, and it's political; it has aspects of coming-of-age drama while also exploring the gaps between generations; there is poetry in both language and vision; it feels at times like a fantasy, but one achieved through realism, through the rare opportunity to peer into a world most of us would never have the opportunity to see.  Written and directed by Deepa Mehta, WATER is the third in her "elemental trilogy," having been preceded by EARTH and FIRE. I had seen neither before watching the DVD of WATER, so don't worry, you don't need to know the other stories to know what's happening in this one. You're probably going to want to go back and watch the others just because WATER was so good, though. I know I have put them at the top of my rental queue.   WATER is set in India during the 1930s. Gandhi is starting to gain notoriety and his progressive ideas are sweeping over a nation that has spent too much time under foreign rule. That is merely a backdrop, however, an indication of a larger social milieu. The real story is in an ashram where widows live the remainder of their lives in a state of denial, compelled by Hinduism to abandon the material world at the same time their husbands did. Only, since they are still alive, they have to do so by renouncing their very existence. Heads shaved, allowed only one meal a day, and forbidden from any extended contact with men, they live a meager existence together in their own pocket culture.  The film opens when eight-year-old Chuyia (played by Sarala) is informed that her husband has died. Not even old enough to realize that she had been married, Chuyia is in a state of confusion when she is shuffled off to the widows' ashram. She rebels and fantasizes about escaping. Eventually, she settles in, befriending the beautiful Kalyani (Lisa Ray), who has been forced into prostitution by the rotund ruler of the house, Madhumati (Manorama), in order to provide for the needs of the other widows. Chuyia and Madhumati clash instantly, and it's only thanks to intervention of the calm Shakuntala (Seema Biswas) that the young girl escapes a beating.  The injustice of how the widows live is quite obvious, and Mehta doesn't have to overdo it to make us see her point. She deliberately sets the movie at a time of cultural change in India, because it gives her a convenient platform to illustrate this bizarre situation. The three generations of women--Chuyia, Kalyani, and Shakuntala--represent three tiers of belief. The youngest does not yet know what is in store for her, whereas the older is completely resigned to her fate. It's only the middle woman, Kalyani, who is aware of both sides, and who can temper the hope of the child with the wisdom of age. The handsome and sensitive Narayan represents the progressive mind of India. He is willing to buck his mother's desires for him to marry within his class, smitten as he is with Kalyani. A student of Gandhi, Narayan is also an aficionado of romantic poetry, imagining himself as a warrior in an epic battle for love. He's going to marry Kalyani, and he's not afraid of the consequences.  Naturally, changes of this kind do come with consequences, and none of the women are unaffected. Shakuntala is goes through the deepest transformation, and the fate of the child is placed on her back. All the actors are great, but Biswas has the most work to do. The gradual erosion of her resolve could have been overwrought, but she makes the inner conflict feel real. It's largely down to her that the ending works. Once again, in less capable hands, the final scenes could have been schmaltzy, but Mehta is not interested in a complete triumph. She has written a story where good things happen, but with the appropriate price.  Just as complex as the social issues is Mehta's approach to the various images of water in the movie. She is not content to establish one metaphor for the element, but to look at all of its uses. It might be cleansing and life giving, but it can also take away. It can ferry us to a new life or to our own destruction. The most romantic use of water imagery, however, is when Narayan is alone with Kalyani and he recites a verse about how rain clouds are the messengers of the heavens. Thus, his failure to see an oncoming storm also becomes all the more ironic.   Even if WATER didn't have such an involving story, it would be worth watching just to look at it. Mehta and her director of photography, Giles Nuttgens (YOUNG ADAM), are clearly enamored of India. The city streets are lovingly shot, the details of the people and their surroundings orchestrated down to the smallest detail. This means they also don't shy away from the squalor, which provides an excellent contrast to the gorgeous nature shots. The ones centered around water are particularly beautiful.   WATER isn't just an exceptional movie, but it's also an exceptional DVD. In addition to a commentary by Deepa Mehta, there are two featurettes on the making of the movie. A lot of preparation went into getting the historical and cultural details of the movie correct, but there was also a behind-the-scenes struggle to get the movie made that is just as interesting as the final product. Faced with opposition from religious fundamentalists who misconstrued Mehta's intentions, the production was shut down before it started, and it took Mehta several years to get it going again. When she did, she had to shoot in Sri Lanka instead of India. For a film about the gradual change of religious politics set over sixty years ago, the battle against Water is a grim reminder that we're still faced with such problems today. 
 There are not images as I expected throughout the book. But the narrative is light and fun about learning yoga. 
 Works great on most knifes. If you have cheap knives, you can not get a good bevel edge on the blade. Would recommend to anyone 
 After I read this book,   I told everyone I know about it.   It is a simple book that makes you think.   Everyone should read this book.  I think it is a great gift for  graduates 
 As an avid journaler, I'm always intrigued to see what other people write about, draw about or observe in their own journals. There's nothing quite so personal as seeing what someone else has created at their most free - there's a certain kind of vulnerability and exposure on display that you don't get to see in a piece of artwork that has been created with the hope that it will have an audience.   Jennifer New has assembled an interesting and inspired collection of journals by people from all walks of life. Only a few of them are artists by profession, but this book demonstrates how many people keep an art journal, and how different their purposes are for doing so. Most of the journals feature sketching, sometimes with the addition of watercolour, although there are also collages, photo montages and pages comprised of found items and ephemera.  I like the way the author has grouped the journals by how she sees their primary function: observation, reflection, exploration or creation. Among the 'observation' journalers are an illustrator who works alongside a marine biologist, a vulcanologist, and a man who embarked on a self-portrait photographic project he called "I Learn Something New Every Single Day" in which he took a daily photo of himself and annotated it with one thing he learned that day, whether it was something important, or trivia about the lives of his friends. In the 'creation' category the author has put those who use their journals primarily for developing their ideas into larger creative projects, including an architect, a quilter, and someone remodeling their garden. The categories in between include travel journals, dream journals, and all sorts of books filled with random collections of thoughts and materials.  I think anyone who keeps a journal (or would like to) will be inspired by this book, not just by the images but also by the introduction to each theme and artist. There's a great balance of text and photographs, and I enjoyed reading each person's thoughts on the part that journalling plays in their lives. 
 This is a good weekend afternoon with nothing scheduled kind of game.Our 2 middle school age and 1 highschool age children along with their friends  enjoy this game with us the parents.There is a good deal of stored obscure  information that comes to the surface when playing.It seems to have some  questions that are fairly tough 
 People familiar with studies of the Plains Indians and their culture already know that this is the defininitive book on the Cheyennes. The details of their history, culture, and religion are fascinating.  However,  those just beginning to dabble in this area of study should be warned, it  may be more than they are looking for right now.  For example, the  alliances and warfare between the Cheyenne and other tribes would be very  difficult to follow if you didn't already  know a little bit about who they  were and how their migratory paths crossed,etc.  Once you've done a fair  amount of study on the subject, however, your library will not be complete  without it 
 I finally got around to watching this movie last night (after buying it for $4 on DVD a few weeks ago) and I can say I was very pleasantly surprised by it after reading so many negative reviews.    The Problem: This film was mareketed poorly - the trailers give an accurate idea of the content, but they give you the wrong impression as to the tone.  Because Bruce Willis is in it, they chose to make it out to contain tons of action and heroic combat!  They also chose to make it appear to be a Bruce Willis vehicle.  Let me tell you, if you are renting or buying it for either of the above reasons, you will hate it!  The "combat action" scenes are sparse (two scenes) and extremely short (though very exciting when they do occur.  And Bruce Willis is really a supporting actor to Farrel - in fact, of the major characters, he probably has less screen time than anyone else, and is rarely seen outside of Farrel's perspective.    (Also, Americans seem to reject the idea that Nazis in an interrment camp could have had a shred of civility.  Perhaps this film gave them a little too much credit - but I think that even as evil as they were, not all Nazis were inhuman brutes.)  The Good: So, the first thing you need to do is lay aside your expectation of a SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or GUNS OF NAVARONNE type movie.  This is a drama!  And it is a very good one.  There are several layers to this story - one is that of Lt. Hart's (Colin Farrel) need for redemption after an early failure in the film.  His assignment to defend the falsely accused marine gives him that chance.  The main story is the trial of a marine who asserts he was framed for the murder of a fellow marine in the stockade.  Farrel quickly learns that the cards are stacked against him as the presiding officer McNamara (Willis) seemse bent on a guilty verdict.  This sets up some very tense confrontations between the two.  Adding a second layer to this drama is the apparently misunderstood character of the commanding Nazi officer Werner Visser.  Visser represents an aging officer who has wound up in a remote post and seems to have accepted this lesser role.  (Someone commented below that his "nice guy" attitude would not get him far in the German Army - ahem, well, I think that's the point - that's why he's watching over a camp rather than storming the frontlines!) He is a foil to Willis's McNamara, who wants nothing more than to get back to the war.  The confusion as to why Visser suddenly wants to help Hart is that people perceive this as Visser suddenly becoming the nice Nazi.  Well, anyone paying attention can see that Visser is ONLY motivated by getting back at McNamara.  Hart is a convenient tool to do so - but there is not fondness for Hart from Visser, as you will see by the film's end.  The third layer is that of the racist motivation behind the original crime.  Two of the confined officers are African-American, and they are portrayed in a very heroic light here - but the white enlisted men are very prejudiced to their presence (this is the 40s, remember).  This gives ample opportunity to see racism as it truly is - these are fine outstanding officers, but their contributions are ignored by those who only see the color of their skin.  Someone said below that the film portrayed the African-American soldiers as Spineless and hapless - I don't know what movie he saw, I think the film COMBATED this misconception!  Combining these three threads takes a skillful director, and Hoblit shows himself up to the task.  The film never loses momentum, but switches nicely between the various threads.  The writing is crisp, the cinematography is appropriately drab and dreary in its own beautiful way (love the light beams coming through the barrack windows) and the few actions scenes keep the excitement level high.  All told, this is an excellent movie, and one I am proud to own - it's a shame more people will miss out on it because of the critics who didn't get it.  The Bad: That is not to say it is the perfect film.  I did have a difficult time following alot of what was going on for the first hour, but near the end, when a plot twist was introduced, much of these scenes made more sense.  Also, some of the dialogue was either poorly recorded, or poorly delivered.  But, my main gripe was covered above about the misleading marketing of this film.  The Summation: Think of it as a combination of THE GREAT ESCAPE, A FEW GOOD MEN, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD - with the final sum being just a few notches below each of these titles, and you'll get an idea of what you're in for . . . give it a chance 
 This book has all of the elements of a nonfiction classic: It is informative, covers a facinating topic, and -- most importantly -- is a delight to read. I couldn't put it down and finished it in less than two days.   Contrary to what some other reviewers have said, the book is *not* boring. It is paced well, departing from chronological order in the right places to create narrative tension (it is obvious that this is an experienced and talented author). It also sheds very needed light on the revered but misunderstood author of one of the greatest books in American literature. I can't believe I have read To Kill a Mockingbird about 15 times, yet before this book I didn't even know the author's real first name. I was completely engrossed learning about the real-life people on which TKAM was based.  I highly recommend the book if you love a good biography, if you loved To Kill a Mockingbird, or if you are just looking for a compelling nonfiction read. Well worth the time 
 Before I purchased this album, I always had listened to rap or hip-hop primarily for the beats. I would buy CD's that had one single on MTV, thinking that the beat was hot. I would wonder why these albums would get old after several listenings. I needed something that was more fulfilling.  When I first bought this album, I have to admit that I didn't think much of  it at first. I loved the beat for "Make Room," but that was about  it. As I was determined to not let my [money] go to waste, I kept  the album on heavy rotation. It sounded better and better every time that I  listened to it, and taught me that hip-hop or any true art, is never  appreciated at first glance. This album epitomizes everything that is real  in hip-hop: dope lyrics, fluid beats, and intellectual creativity. Tha Liks  prove that they are true to hip-hop by not pursuing any false, trendy  ideals and just representing themselves with their music. Some ill shit by  some down-to-earth, funny, drunk muthafuckas 
 I have been working in the field of RCM since 1991. During that time I have read most of the texts in the marketplace on the subject as well as having worked in a range of countries and industries using a range of different methods.   Johns book is unique in that it is set in the context of asset maintenance as a managerial discipline of growing strategic significance. His vast knowledge, coupled with the vast knowledge and resources of his network of RCM practitioners, have combined to make this the finest text on RCM that has been produced to date.  If you want to get to know a little about RCM, understand how it is applied, and understand some of the techniques and principles that make up this area of expertise, then there is no better book in todays marketplace. I still carry a copy with me today on most jobs I undertake.  Written in laymans terms Johns' book is the most read book on the subject, and remains the standard by which others are measured. Don't waste your time elsewhere 
 This compact work introduces Bernard Bailyn's multi-volume population history of America.  This work offers a colorful portrait of settlement throughout British North America before the American Revolution.  Various  regions and colonies are considered in detail. For a contrasting  consideration of British East Florida, see the relevant essay in The  African American Heritage of Florida 
 As always, Eric Jerome Dickey writes a fantastic book that has you captivated from the first page to the end.  I'm looking to read more of his books as they become available 
 What the heck is taking this series so damn long to reach DVD as a nice box set, it was one of the most treasured series among the "GI Joe/Transformers/Thundercats" generations, and yet as amazingly well done, well written, well animated, as it was, there was NEVER a toy line, or serious merchandising as there could`ve been (even as an adult, i`d still LOVE a set of D&D action figures of the main characters)... But for there to be DVDs of every other cartoon series of this generation EXCEPT this one (as well as the amazingly well done "Legend of Prince Valiant", which also deserves a box set of DVDs...easily...)is simply inexcusable...!!!! What shocks me actually, is that the producer of this series is MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT, who is well known to whore-out just about everything for every little penny they can get, so it actually comes as quite a bit of a shock indeed... What are they waiting for? Haven`t they seen by the popularity of every other DVD set so far of the best Saturday morning shows that sales are a no-brainer look at sales for "Battle of the Planets, Land of the Lost, GI Joe, Thundercats, Transformers, etc etc etc...). C`mon guys, WAKE UP AND SMELL THE MONEY.... I`ll be first on line... I saw an actual boxed set in a record store the other day of the "complete series", but it was made for "outside the USA dvd players"...it LOOKED like a professional release, not a cheap bootleg, so I was REALLY pissed...I want a box set for the good `ol USA...anybody else have any thoughts 
 After the last year of telling all of my friends about Cathi Hanauer's The Bitch in the House, I'm now delighted to have discovered yet another provocative book (albeit a little late) about the current generation of women and the difficult choices we are making regarding work and family.  What an emotional ride! I couldn't put it down.   Orenstein managed to touch upon all the contradictions that highly-educated career women face in this "postfeminist" moment without oversimplifying our decisionmaking.  Like some of the other reviewers, I did recommend this book to my husband as it is a testament to the struggles we face.  But if you are looking for easy answers, this isn't the book.  If you are looking for a narrative that will give you some insight as to how other women are carving out lifestyles that, although less than perfect, are fulfilling and even joyful then this book is for you 
 EVERY SONG ON THIS JOURNEY CD IS GREAT, BUT "PEOPLE" IS WORTH EVERY CENT OF THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR THE WHOLE CD. 'NUFF SAID 
 I discovered Dave Barry in a Reader's Digest article titled "The Martian Death Flu". That short story inaugurated a fascination for all things Barry and "Big Trouble" is a faithful depiction of the mind of this Miami madman. This Pulitzer-prize winning columnist meets the director of "Men In Black" and TV's The Tick.  Sonnenfeld's touch and a good soundtrack contribute to this madcap misadventure where a hallucinogenic toad, a sub-compact car, and a 'garbage disposal' bomb make for an outrageous race to save a corporate embezzler's step-daughter.  An immaculate cast certifies the action will be riveting and breath-taking viewing after viewing. Thanks, Dave!  
 The details of everyday life in A Confederacy of Dunces add up to a complex picture of New Orleans in the early sixties.  We get a sense, as well, of the changes coming on a broader level:  the old world is passing away, and a new world is coming into being on the streets of the Quarter.  Critical Theory students at Louisiana State University are analyzing this text nine different ways, and finding a multitude of meanings.  They understand how New Historical analysis proves especially delightful and insightful 
 Haven't finished it yet.  But I did stop in wonder for a good long while when I read that Plato (PLATO!) had given a good long description of the deforestation and erosion of Greece.  It covers more ground than the (similar point of view and many years later) Jared Diamond Collapse.  For instance, in a later chapter that I skimmed early on, he talks about epidemics and sickness.  Our best health care in the world, in Ponting's view, is mostly following, not altogether successfully, in the footsteps of basic sanitation--i.e., public health and nutrition trump treatment for disease.  I expect that I don't, and won't as I continue to read, agree with everything he says. But he does makes one think.   
 I'm more of a World War 2 fan and read alot of WW2 stuff, but even so this book was excellent.  Homer is da bomb.  I saw "Rocket Boys" 10 years ago and this book was very similar to that movie, even though they are of different periods.  I didn't know how good these books were, but should have after watching rocket boys.  This book is great 
 Jagged Edge proved theu were a force to be recokned with the JE Heartbreak CD. Every song on the CD had single poetnial and there's no filler on the CD at all.  1.Heartbreak - Nice Intro with Brian tenor at it's best  2. Did She Say - The Beatnuts sampled Riff is cool and the beat is also really good.  3. He Can't Love You - The lead single which was a mixtape favorite back in 2000.  4. What You Tryin To Do - Another killer slow song that works well as pillow talk.  5.Girl Is Mine - Uptempo track with a cameo from Ja Rule  6. Healing - Standard Jagged Edge slow jam  7.Let's Get Married - The second single although I never really cared for this song it has become a staple at many ghetto weddings.  8.True Man - My signature song to all the women who've done me wrong in life.  9.Can I Get With You - Nice midtempo track  10.Promise - One of the biggest songs from the CD and a masterpiece  11.Keys To The Range - Classic club track  12. Lace You - Standard JE sex track.   J.E. Heartbreak is one of the best albums JE has recorded to date and I doubt if they'll ever top this one 
 Grisham does it again- a GREAT READ. I would recommend this title to any Law and Order junkie. 
 The authors of this book are prestigious scientists who convincingly make their core point that it is crucial to carefully time the intake of particular types of sports drinks during and after exercise in order to build muscles. The book has a table of contents, extensive bibliography, index, and provides charts for determining one's daily calorie needs as well as sample meal plans for the recommended diet. After carefully studying the book, I wanted to instantly put the authors' ideas into action. Unfortunately, that was very hard to do because the book is not particularly user-friendly: (1) Because the book is aimed at weight lifters, one has to read the authors' other book, The Performance Zone, to find out that their sport-drink recommendations apply to all types of exercise. (2) The book is written like a college textbook rather than a how-to for the general public. (3) The authors don't provide either a list of sources for their sports drinks or do-it-yourself recipes. (4) The math is confusing in the important charts on pages 96-104. They give 3 examples, a 200-lb male who works out an unspecified amount of time once/day who needs 3800 calories/day; a 200-lb male who works out an unspecified amount twice/day who needs 4200 calories/day; a 130-lb-female who works out an unspecified amount once/day who needs 2340 calories/day. All 3 are instructed to drink the same amount of the 3 sports drinks, regardless of muscle mass or length of workout, and only the first male is instructed to take the muscle-growth drink before bed. I believe a 130-lb woman would, logically, require only about HALF of the drinks the 200-lb guys would need, and I can't figure out why everyone wouldn't need the bedtime protein drink. For more detailed info on titrating your dosage, you'll need to go to the authors' other book.   Based on the information in the book, I laboriously created recipes for the drinks and am offering them here to save others the trouble. Note that the authors believe any simple sugar works well for the drink =except= fructose (fruit juice) because it can cause stomach upset in some people. Since I don't have this problem, I use fruit juice in my recipes but have provided the sugar equivalent for those who do. If you use sugar, I recommend that, to improve the taste, you flavor the drink with 1 tablespoon (T) lemon juice, which has only 1 gram (G) carbohydrate (C) per T. The drinks are made in a blender or shaker.   Energy Drink (6P, 24C): Combine fruit juice with water for a total of 16 oz (juice options: 7 oz pear juice OR 7 oz orange juice OR 6 oz pineapple juice). If sugar is preferred, instead of juice use: 2T sugar & 1T lemon juice in 16 oz water. Add 5 teaspoon (t) whey protein powder (calculated using Designer Whey Protein natural flavor, 19P, 2C per 1/3 cup). Add a few grains of potassium chloride (e.g. Nu-Salt salt substitute) & a few grains of table salt. Add 1/8t of Vitamin C crystals, a few drops of Vitamin E oil, 1G leucine powder, and the contents of a broken-open, gelatin capsule of magnesium powder (all from healthfood store). Blend well. Note: add enough water to this mixture so that you can drink 2 oz 10 minutes before you begin and every 20 minutes thereafter, ending with the final dose 20 minutes before you finish the workout--for a 2-hr workout, that would be 6 2-oz doses, or at least 12 ounces. The book recommends drinking plenty of water, as well.  Anabolic Drink (15P, 45C): 16 oz water plus juice (e.g., 13 oz orange juice OR 13 oz pear juice OR 11 oz pineapple juice). Sugar alternative: 4 T sugar & 1 T lemon juice in 16 oz water. Add 4 T whey protein powder, 2G leucine powder, 2G glutamine powder (healthfood store), pinch Vit. C crystals, few drops Vit. E oil. Drink the whole thing right after your workout--or within 45 minutes at the latest.  Growth Drink (20P, 4C): 2/3 cup water, 1/3 cup fat-free milk (provides 4C & 3P--2G of the P is casein & 1G whey), 3G leucine powder, 1G glutamine powder, 13G whey protein powder (3T & scant 4th T), 1/4t sugar. Note: some may be horrified that I provide the 2G of casein required for this drink from plain, nonfat milk instead of fancy casein protein powder. By all means use that if you have it on hand, simply substituting 2G of casein powder for the milk and adding a tad more whey protein and water to your batch. Drink the whole thing 2-4 hours after the workout and make another batch to drink at bedtime 
 As one reviewer said, Miguel Migs truly can't do no wrong!  With his impressive array of "deep" house grooves and flawless mixing, I give him the title of "Master Mix-Master."  As with his past work on the Nude Dimensions series and his own outstanding release, "Colorful You", Migs creates a CD condusive for every party occassion.  Highly Recommended!! 
 A refreshing book of fantasy and rhymes, 'Rootabaga Stories' is sure to please. This is the kind of book I know everyone will love and it is also a great book to read aloud, for a bedtime story or a rainy day. If you've  read it once, the odds are 1 to 99 that you'll read it again. I have read  it 6 times and am still coming back for more. Ingeniously written, Carl  Sandberg has done it again. This is a great book for children reading, but  also for adults! In fact, this would be a good book for a child and an  adult to read togethor.  A sure pleaser 
 Is this movie trying to implying that it's bad to be a greedy, maniacal corporate leader without conscience or empathy? C'mon, get outta here. They could not possibly think THAT up in Hollywood, could they? Well, Mr. Destiny, played by Michael Caine, offers James Belushi a chance to be a wealthy corporate hot shot instead of a regular James. As you can imagine, it does not work our well for James. You know, self-loathing, John Lovitz (a friend) almost commits suicide--the usual stuff. The movie has funny moments, and the pace is pretty good. The ending is somewhat predictable, James is happy to be a regular James (again). It's not all about the money. I don't blame him, I wouldn't wanna be a Kenneth Lay either 
 I loved this Amy Tan book, it's an easy read and will have you drawn in right away to the story.  This series written by Amy Tan is easily digestable and enjoyable to read, sometimes it's hard for me to engage a book but the books written by Amy Tan are so colorful and descriptive, it just draws me in and I can't stop reading.  This series is probably the best of it's series, diasecting the mother daughter relationship on such a delicate and complicated subject, a Chinese mother and an American born daughter who unknowingly lets the opportunity escape her to truly understand the intents and passions of her mother.  Bridged by communication gaps and difference in language styles and a mother who might be troubled with dimentia, this mother-daughter journey is plagued with mishaps and turmoil.  When June, the daughter, accepts new reason for her mother's off key personality, June offers too little too late and soon she has too many loose strings of her mother's past that she earlier dismissed as nonsense or retoric, to tie together to make sense.  June traces the pieces back to gain what her mother generously offered her in knowledge, but what becomes clear is the spirit of her mother lives inside of her as she comes to grips with who she is as a person and what her purpose in life is. I loved this book and have read almost the entire Amy Tan series. This book is the HINGE of all Amy Tan books, read this and you'll understand the others with new clarity!  LOVED IT!  WILL READ IT AGAIN!  
 It is has the best lyrics ever.  This CD is very educative and fun.  As one of his students I know he is very good at music.  You have to buy this CD!!  You will love the number 1 CD ever made.  This album has what you want to know about math.  It also helps you in spanish 
 I try to avoid giving five stars as a small gesture towards reducing Amazon's version of grade inflation, but can't help it here.   The edition: These Everyman cloth editions are just excellent. P&V's translation flows beautifully. The paper is high quality and the font is easy on the eyes. The book simply feels good in your hands. I'm tired of cheaply printed versions of classics--this edition does justice to its content.  The task of reading it: A reading group provides incentive to keep up the pace. I read this in a few weeks, 250 pp in the last three days. This is exhausting but if you can find the stamina to get through it in a short time it's better I think--the novel really inhabits your head so the impact is greater. The only place where I struggled was getting through Ippolit's interminable letter. At this pace you feel a bit of D's "brain fever" yourself.  The novel itself: It's a great choice for a book club because it opens up so many topics for discussion. For example:  --The distinctions among innocence, idiocy, and mere stupidity. How the prince's innocence waxes and wanes according to the needs of the plot. --The expedience of "fever"--does fever absolve the characters of responsibility for their actions? (See also Crime and Punishment). If it doesn't, what is its point? --Similarly, epilepsy. What difference does it make that he is epileptic? Plotwise, not much?  --Love as plot device. "Love" happens as if turned on by a switch. Both female leads are beautiful leading to wondering if the love is infatuation. Falling in "love" with a beautiful women is a mistake not specific to idiots indeed has been the downfall of many a wise man. What if one or both of the love interests were simply ordinary looking? --Once caught in prince's (lady trouble) dilemma, how might a non-innocent have been able to recover? No obvious solution, even for a wise man. --D's seeming disdain for work--anybody with a job is a beast of burden. Originality is more important than responsibility. His artistic characters lose money, lend money to nogoodniks, give it away, gamble it away, even burn it in a fire. None of this is judged to be "idiotic". Prince conveniently loses enough of his fortune to shysters to demonstrate his innocence, but manages to wise up (not described--see variability of innocence above) and hang on to enough of it to maintain status in his aristocratic circle. Money is only something you ought to have enough of to be able to make dramatic gestures that demonstrate your disinterest in the practical aspects of life. To actually go and earn it doing something of value to society reveals you to be not very bright at best, and, worst of all sins to D, "unoriginal".  But the plot is just something to hang the characters on. The psychological insights to be found on nearly every page are astonishing. When I finished I gasped--my head was full of another man's genius. This is why we read. 
 This book has probably shaped the intellectual debate about the Middle East among interested Western experts as late Palestinian scholar Edward Said coined a new term for these non-Arab experts dealing with Arab issues: Orientalists. Said would stick to this theory throughout his consequent writings and as he used it often to undermine the credibility of some famous Western writers on Middle Eastern issues arguing that no experts could surpass the analytical ability of the natives who are clearly in a better positioned to study and analyze their own culture. The book that was published in 1978 was adopted in the curriculum of some universities in the Middle East while it provoked some Western thinkers who retaliated against Said by discrediting his professorship of Comparative English Literature. According to Said's opponents, if they were unable to understand the oriental culture which they did not belong to, then he could not lecture on English literature since he was an Arab. The debate over the concept of Orientalism survives Said and is - to this day - under debate 
 Shania Twain provides 100 percent on her astonishing and incredible live performance. She totally rocks from start to finish and guest stars such as Elton John and The Backstreet Boys join her on this unforggetable Musical Event held in miami florida. Shania Twain "GOD Bless You Always" 
 The product is of a high quality material, and the zipper is heavy duty and has not jammed in the time since I purchased this product 
 This book is somewhat predictable and simplistic, but I found it well worth the time taken to read it.  It is a basic gay teen love story, only with some depressing and brutal twists.  
 This book could possibly be the most powerful resource I found during my journey out of a worn out ideology. He lays out, with quiet inspiration, the importance of myth in our lives and empowers us to create a new mythology when we've watched an old, familiar one die. In the spirit of Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung. 
 This is a good movie that the whole family can watch. It is for fun and it is fun. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to see the lessons in it and one does not have to take the fun out of this movie by being anal. It is a feel-good family movie with something to offer everyone 
 Not In His Image is perhaps the most important book of the past 100 years, that is, of course, in my view. The crux of the problem is, frankly, one about beliefs. We need to challenge, dissect, examine, question our beliefs, which we do not do (as a matter of habit, at least). Beliefs drive behavior. It's as simple as that. And the beliefs we possess are driving a form of behavior that is destroying our planet and all that lives on it. Lash goes into some very fascinating stuff, but I will bring up just 3 key points: One is the matter of patriarchy which THRIVES throughout this world, even in India and my beloved Tibet (I am a student of Tibetan Buddhism). Until we return to some semblance of balance between and within the genders, it's going to continue to be tough sledding. The 2nd is the victim/perpetrator syndrome, the result of the massive, widespread destruction of the indigenous peoples of old Europe by Rome which in turn, of course, set up the same principal for those destroyed and thus you get horrendous colonialism and the virtual wipe out of most all indigenous peoples of the world. The 3rd is narcissism, something that John posits flourished starting at about the time of Christ, or about the dawning of the Piscean Age, and is vastly distinct from what existed prior to. You put these 3 together and I would suggest such beliefs have driven behavior on a downward spiral for all of mankind, but most especially Europe and now America. There is a root cause situation here that needs to be SEEN and explained and thereby hopefully invites people to truly examine their beliefs and effect change. This book is an important first step in figuring out an exit strategy into the life we all deserve.   
 I have been listening to JLP since Imaginary Voyage, (New Country, Milky Way etc.) This is progressive jazz at its best. His style is the one and only. Fast and progressive. Tip towing through the stars like a comet. This album was just an anthitesis of the flight to the stars of a man that has impacted me in a great way since I first listen to him. At his Live concerts, with his "Good Evening". he played all of his album like a medly. Soft, continues, lavish, like floting in the galaxey 
 I found this book on my own before going to get my MBA and was always a bit embarrased to admit that I had learned more from this book than any other (it's design makes it look a bit elementary).  I was pleasantly surprised to see that my Finance professor at the MBA program (Babson - the #1 entrepreneurship program 11 years running) brought it out on the first day and said it was a "must" for any businessperson's library!  It is a fantastic resource - don't let the look fool you 
 Simple as that-anything Jamee Ruth writes is worth it. If you need a perfect wedding or birthday gift, a grill pan and this book is perfect 
 This is a wonderful country-rock type album with a heavy Neil Young influence. Moorer's voice is sexy and bluesy and glides effortlessly over crunchy, hot, yummy guitars. A seriously melancholic thread weaves its way through every track, (w/ lyrics like "The cuckoo clock quit chirping/The bird fell out and died/Spent its whole life working/And never learned to fly/It ran out of time."), which is very much to my liking.  Also recommended: Anne McCue's Roll. She's an Australian femme w/ serious electric guitar chops. 
 I purchased this particular selection on a whim about 2 months ago.  I'd never heard of John Mayer before, but it was the newest looking selection in the section I was looking in. I haven't stopped listening to it since.  The music is full of soul.  I like the rock/blues mix and it reminds me of Stevie Ray Vaughn.  I am a huge fan of any musician who can "make you feel it".  I would really like to go to the live concert, but can't find anything in the mid-atlantic states!  I recently purchased "Heavier Things".  Rock on, John 
 This album pretty much sums upp Rebas early MCA years, but her hits isn't very appealing, at least to me. its the songs that weren't released as singles that are good! But by all means it's a quite good album still 
 Picadilly Jim is the first Wodehouse book I have read and thoroughly enjoyed it.This is not a book that you finish reading in 3 days.You want to take your time and relish the language and the play of words.  The story has many layers and each layer is as delightful (if not more) as the previous one. Cant wait to read another Wodehouse 
 This book sits somewhere between an easy read for non-historians, and a heavy, detailed tome for scholars.  Since Victoria was related to practically every royal that lived in Europe during the 19th Century, following all the connections to their ultimate ends would make for a many thousand page work.  This book really does not leave the British Isles, which left me somewhat disappointed, since so much important history related to Victoria's reign occurred elsewhere.  If the book gave me more detail, I would have given it 5 stars.  For me it was a bit light.  I can't get enough of the finer political details, which are covered somewhat superficially here.  If you are looking for a PhD level work, this is not it - 12th grade Advanced Placement European History, this will do 
 This is one of those movies that goes out of it's way to offend, gross out everyone with a joke somewhere around the corner.  The movie is in my mind absolutly HELLARIOUS.  The movie has Gore/Rape/Homeless People/Sex/Vioulence/Major FX.  The movie is based on a bottle of booze called Viper which was released to rid off homeless people.  Well one case of this still remained and somehow the Liquor store owner had some stashed in his basement.  Well the movie starts there.. Well every friggen homeless person seems to accidently run cross a bottle of Viper and once you drink it, it's like acid and does some really neat melting and exploding effects to your body.  This by no means a movie for people who get easily bruised by senseless humor.  But to me it's funny and the acting is pretty good knowing it's a B-movie.  So if you don't mind a homeless guys exploding/ melting/ having ones wee wee ripped off playing football in slowmotion sequences. Than this movie is for you..  All I have to say is keep an open mind and you won't be dissapointed. 
 This album ROCKS! I love the song "Los Angeles". I heard it on the radio in Seattle around 1994 and ran out to the record store and bought it immediately. The pixies were great and so is Frank Black. This monkey is going to heaven 
 I had attempted to crochet several times after having been an obsessive knitter, but have always gotten frustrated with learning on my own.  On a whim I got this book, and within 15 mins had a pretty good-sized crochet sample that was neat and contained several different stitches.    For such a small book there are very detailed instructions for beginner crocheters for many stitch variations and projects. The directions are so crystal clear that even a younger teenager would have no problems learning, and the projects are contemporary and varied.  Teens and young adults would especially like some of the projects, such as a delicate lacy camisole or the beach cover-up.  I crocheted a square variation on the cat bed which my cat adores.  The example pictures use yarns with shimmer and contrasting colors so the stitches really stand out, a solution to an annoying problem I have had with many knitting and crochet books.  As an added bonus, the book has a trifold so you can stand it up and look at it as you crochet 
  I'm no longer in the target audience for this movie.  I realize that.  I checked out this DVD not as a lame attempt to convince myself that I'm still young and hip.  I actually was interested because I heard it was the first American major motion picture to feature Asian characters as the leads but not stereotypically, not utilizing the Asian ethnicity as a comic device.  Not as comically impish cartoon characters, not as martial artists or wise sages.  Also, I really like White Castle burgers.  I wasn't disappointed.  The lead characters are two Asian American men who have reasonably well-developed, three-dimensional characters.  That was refreshing.  However, I wouldn't say this movie is free of stereotypes.   The Asian women in this movie are definitely in the mold of the church-going, hard-working but ultra-dorky Asian.  And, in fact, all the women in this movie are stereotypes of one sort or another.  Come to think of it, even the Asian men in this movie, outside of the two leads, are stereotypes.  I'm thinking of the budding entrepreneur asking Harold for a letter of recommendation, and also of Kumar's hard-working doctor father, forcing Kumar into a series of fixed medical school interviews.  And the two Jewish stoners.  And the white, racist skateboard punks.  But, okay.  Little steps.  Some of the humor in this movie really worked for me, such as Harold and Kumar inexplicably happening upon a lion in New Jersey, and riding it to their next point of adventure.  Some of the humor is vulgar, gross-out humor that didn't work for me.  I'm not opposed to vulgarity and gross-out humor when it is in the service of good comedy ("Borat" being the most obvious recent example, or the "Blazing Saddles" campfire scene being a more classic example) but here it felt like it was in lieu of comedy.  Cheap laughs.  Again, though, it probably worked, in the theater, on the intended audience of inebriated adolescent boys.    Not great but I'm glad I saw it.  An overall thumbs up.  I also appreciated some of touches on the DVD, such as the backdrop of Harold and Kumar sitting in the car during the main menu, which is not a still from the movie but a good twenty minutes of the two of them sitting there driving, occasionally asking each other what is taking the viewer so long to make a selection.  Once you realize it's not on a short loop, you're obligated to sit and watch it and see how long it can go on.  
 I sat there reading this book and I kept say no way, and impossible.  Finally my husband made me leave the room.  I like the fact that there is no exaggeration.  A few times I was sure that the case had to be wrong, so I did my research.  Each case I looked up made me shake my head in dismay.  How screwed up is the system?  Read this and find out. 
 Mary Broad had a brief moment of celebrity, and this is probably one of the only reasons we know so much about the life and times of not just Broad, but others like her. Women who lived a hand to mouth existence, who trod on the wrong side of the law, and then suffered the horrific consequences of British Justice in the late Eighteenth century.  Broad was committed to transportation to the extremely new colony of New South Wales in Australia, first imprisoned on the stinking hulks which had their own brutal justice systems on board. Then the terrible long journey half way round the world, only to reach Australia and suffer famine from failed crops.   Her stoicism in spite of enormous hardship and her ability to survive are testament to an extraordinary woman, and her story of survival is amazing.  Erikson has done a great job as usual drawing from sources to outline the social aspects of the time and combining them to reflect what she lived through where her accounts are limited. Certainly, there are many accounts of male life in transporation but few remain of what women's lot were. Sian Rees published a great book a few years ago called Floating Brothel, which I would highly recommend to read with this one - it follows a transport ship of women and what happened to them on the ship and after - as the title of that book reflects it was not an easy voyage.  Mary Broad escaped from Australia and was eventually recaptured and returned to Britain where she was imprisoned again, only the intervention of the writer, Boswell (who was famous for his connection to the Johnson) garnered a royal pardon for her.  Erickson has been a prolific but good writer, I have enjoyed many of her previous biographies including and excellent one on the Regency period. It was a very good read, but my only real quibble with it is I felt it was less fluid than some I have read lately which have been page turners (without being tabloid). It had a nice measured pace and I found I was kept interested in the outcome to the end. Overall a nice interesting history which should appeal to a wide range of readers 
 "The Martians have arrived. Let the war begin." A catchphrase that could easily be employed for Herbert George Wells's most acclaimed science fiction "The War of the Worlds". This is a novel revolving around the highly improbable but simultaneously stunningly imaginative idea that the earth is invaded by organisms residing on Mars. Composed in a first person narrative,"The War of the Worlds" is a gripping saga of the millions of people's agony and loss of ease in the face of a confrontation that would change the world for good.  The story begins directly with the theme. In the last years of the 19th.century,in the most unassuming and delicate of all propositions,England witnesses the most surreal threat:ten bizzare cylinders all containing Martians fall near London. A wave of bitter agony,nameless fear and hopeless apprehension rocks the peole and as the Martians gradually come to terms with the Earth's gravitational strength,the police and the military of surrounding regions stolidly enarm themselves for an imminent war. The greatest of all human fallacies is perhaps the absurd universal acknowledgement that humans are the most accomplished creatures anywhere. This myth is firmly exploited in the book a the narrator---an ardent follower of astronomy and scholar of philosophy---perceives a plethora of harrowing incidents that compel him to shudder to his boots.   The narrator's town of Maybury is completely demolished and so are the nearby towns of Woking,Weybridge,Shepperton and others. The narrator manages to traffic his wife to his cousin's place in Leatherhead in asumed safety but himself gets entangled hopelessly and helplessly in the boughs of life and death. In his maddening and desperate escape from the clutches of the more intelligent and powerful Martians,the narrator pairs up first with an artillerman and then with a curate. The latter is a lost soul whose faith in God and religion has broken in the wake of humanity's greatest ever calamity and the former is confident and visonery whose preferred modes of survival in a Martian dominated Earth is not that improbable,if at all naive. H.G.Wells's artistry lies in speedily building up to a great climax and in a plot so utterly novel and unique and symmetrical,this is a marvellous diusplay of wit,intelligence and clearness of structure.  "The War of the Worlds" on one level may appear to be a mere science fiction with vivid illustration of beings from outer space and the havoc they cause on our planet but the essence of the book transcends much beyond this demarcation. The weahness of mankind in the face of unknown,unheard and unthought catatrophes is firmly delineated in this landmark novel and Wells applies a very,very subtle satire on humans' grotesque complacency on teir own abilities. When the artilleryman admits,"we're down;we're beat" with "absolute conviction",the reader fathoms the author's surrender of "the greatest power in the world" to Fate. On a much higher level,"The War of the Worlds" is a massive comment on man's petty as well as magnanimous follies garbed in a dress of science fiction.  Composed in a sense of retrospection,the book does lose some of its charm from the very beginning that the narrator is alive and kicking. and the confinement of the sequence of events within a relatively small England territory narrows the scope of the novel and also trims down its volume. But even so,"The War of the Worlds" is a brilliant science fictin that leads the rteader on a journey on the back of an unfaithful wave that conpires to lead the world to the ultimate diasaster. H.G.Wells was a great visonery in the late 19th.century and it's no less remarkable achievement that this Englishman's great book is still being studied today and would be read for several decades to come. "The War of the Worlds" is a captivating and telling tale that would dazzle the reader by the shine of the writer's craftmanship.    
 The Emergence of Cinema chronicles the very earliest history of cinema with focus on the development of film in America.  It begins with the earliest technology of picture projection, and explores with great thoroughness each development in the technology and business of film.  It is wonderfully illustrated, and clearly written, so that even the casual student of film history will not be confused or bored.  This is a work whose peer I have never seen.  If the rest of the series keeps up with the quality here, it will be basic to any film library.  Perhaps the depth here will be to great for the truly casual reader; hardly any films here will find their way onto video 
 Out of all the shed books I have read, this book stays by my side while I hammer in the yard.  The book is well written by what appears to be a non professional book writer (A Good Thing).  It reads as if you are getting advise in laymans terms from your neighbor "The Craftsman", a welcome change from the DIY books, that assume a level of expertese.  The level of detail is high and discusses gotcha's, advise, and trade "secrets" that could have only come from years of personal experience building sheds. Every aspect of shed building for the DIY'er is covered from different types of foundations and how they work, to different types of structure building such as stick, or mortise joint traditional.  Options for each step are thoroughly discussed and weighed, such as type of shingles, types of siding, types of lumber, and even types of style.   All this information before you get to the shed designs, so when your browsing the designs you can apply the knowledge against them.  The author included several basic designs, all with thorough enough plans and documentation, which you can use right away to start building.  These designs can be combined, or modified easily to suit your needs.  The author even includes color pictures of existing sheds, that can be built all using the basic principals from previous chapters. If your the handy DIY'er that has tackled a few home remodeling projects, this is your book.  If you just have a few basic carpentry skills and are not affraid of using a circular saw, and miter saw, then this book is for you.  Don't know the difference between a cripple stud and a top plate?  Don't worry, this book will teach you 
 Jimmy Stewart stars as the "Lone Eagle" Charles Lindbergh in Billy Wilder's film "The Spirit of St. Louis".  This was a film Stewart wanted to make for years; but was repeatedly turned down.  James Dean was even considered for the role.  Despite the fact that Stewart was already in this 40's (Lindbergh was 25 at the time), Stewart's persistence paid off and Warner Bros. Studios finally relented and let him star as one of American's greatest aviators.  The life of Charles A. Lindbergh is told in a series of memorable flashbacks as he makes his transAtlantic flight.  His life experiences and the people he met along the way are vividly recounted.   On May 20, 1927, at approximately 7:52 in the morning, Charles Lindbergh took off in the "Spirit of St Louis" from Roosevelt Field, Long Island.  A crowd of more than 500 must have thought they had witnessed a miracle as the "Spirit of St. Louis" barely managed to clear the telephone wires at the field's edge in terrible weather conditions. Thirty-three and one half-hours and 3,500 miles later Lindbergh landed in Paris, the first to fly the Atlantic alone.  Many great aviators of the time had tried and failed -- some even lost their lives in this attempt.  Along the way, Lindbergh is forced to conquer his fears, snow, sleet and a lack of sleep to rediscover his faith.  On the evening of May 21, at 10:22, "The Spirit of St. Louis" touched down at Le Bourget Field. A crowd of more than 100,000 people were there to greet American's Lone Eagle.  His feat electrified a nation and inspired an interest in aviation. Unfortunately, this film flopped at the box office; but as the years have passed, this film has gained in respect and is now recognized as one of Stewart's greatest film accomplishments. Enjoy 
 This is a good review of parrots as of around 1960.  If you are interested in what their original distribution was, this is a great book.  If you want to know what species are endangered now, this isn't the place to look.  The text and illustrations are generally good, with references to original sources (albeit old ones).  Age also explains the dearth of information about breeding and behavior for many specie 
 though this was not one of those headlining movies, my older child loves horses, so I went out on a limb to purchase this as a Christmas gift. Though it probably won't win any major awards, the movie itself was surprisingly good. Highly recommend to have on your shelf at home for family movie night 
 This book holds a wealth of information.  As a librarian , I appreciate the practical nature of this book, the interesting style of writing and how well organized it is.  Following Catherine Shaw's guidelines, you are sure  to win your campaign.  I should know, my library was lucky enough to have  her leading our building campaign and we won.  We have since recommended  the book to many other libraries who have had similar success in their  campaigns.  This is a book written by someone who "has been there and  done that".  Her advice is well tested and presented in a way all can  follow.  Highly recommended 
 I am a Financial Planner (CFP) and can recommend this book to everyone. The modern women should use this as guide line to life. 
 I've read this book several times, and it just keeps getting better each time!  Hopefully Mr. Weber will continue writing books of this nature 
 The author of this book is a respected economist and also a former cabinet secretary in the Clinton administration.  Published in the early 1990's, this book provides a short economic history of the US, describes the American economy at his time (the early 1990's) and what lies ahead for America.  In it, Reich covers various topics such as: industrialization, outsourcing of labor, gap between incomes, the growth of financial markets in both the number of people involved, the sums of money involved, and the influence they have on world affairs, and the role of America in world economics.    He points out trends both harmful and beneficial to America, and prescribes changes that could help America, and the world.  These include the traditional liberal stands of investing in education, securing healthcare and other social nets for the poor, protecting the environment, empowering workers, especially those at the bottom of the economic food chain, with greater power in their economic success,   The book is clearly written.  Reich is clearly a Democrat, but the book is not partisan in its treatment, and he emphasizes the importance of government budgets and tax rates in economic policy.  There were several items he should have placed more focus on; privatization of utilities, the growth of intellectual property and its effects on technological growth and individual rights, the spread of credit, and the parallel rise in bankruptcies.  In all the book tends to look at the bright side, and offers many good points for political leaders current and future to consider. 
 I've used LP before for trips.  Once you get the book, you are invited to go on-line for up-dates.  There you are directed to "The Thorn Tree" forum.  I used it just about every day to keep well-informed and prepare for the trip.  The guide is an easy ready and full of useful information.  Prior uses were very accurate 
 I read this book and the sequel, People of the Lie around the time that they came out.  I was stunned by Peck's honesty. The stories of how he and his patients struggle with the problems and obstacles that confront them are amazing.  We don't want to hear that life is difficult. We want to buy something, toothpaste, hair dye, a new car, or find a new relationship that will make things easy for us.  Whenever I need some encouragement, I just find these books on my book shelf 
 What a surprise.  From the title and cover art I was expecting a 4th of July - My country `tis of thee - stand at attention and salute book full of patriotic drivel. But this is a very substantial and thoughtful study of America's institutions and its critics. And the author has a gift for straightforward, easy to understand exposition.    Dinesh D'Souza came to the U.S. as an exchange student from Bombay, India in 1978.  He has had an illustrious career in this, his adoptive country. He's been active in politics as a Presidential advisor and in other capacities, but is mainly a scholar and writer.  He spent ten years with the American Enterprise Institution and at the time of writing this book was a Fellow at the Hoover Institution.  The first chapter tackles all the standard criticisms of America which eminate from the Left, Europe and Islam. In a style that characterizes the entire book, D'Souza presents the arguments and/or complaints against America, its actions, culture, or whatever.  He then replies with a calm, logical, polite but emphatic refutation.  As well as being informative, this book is a lesson in the proper way to conduct a debate.  Not all the complaints against America are refutable.  America is not perfect and D'Souza is the first to admit it.  He never engages in casuistry but admits the faults, past and present,  with candor.  In a Chapter titled "Two Cheers for Colonialism" he describes the wrongs of Western Colonialism, but also argues convincingly that by and large the benefits for those Colonized have outweighed the wrongs.  He avers that the reason the West became the dominant civilization in the modern era is because it invented three institutions: science, democracy and capitalism.  The freedom in the West derives from this combination and allows the human being to become a different sort of person than those still living in traditional societies.   As D'Souza concludes:  "America is a new kind of society that produces a new kind of human being.  That human being - confidant, self-reliant, tolerant, generous, future oriented - is a vast improvement over the wretched, servile, fatalistic, and intolerant human being that traditional societies have always produced, and that Islamic societies produce now."  
 I really enjoyed What's Your Story and found it useful.  Much has been written about storytelling in the business literature lately, but Craig Wortmann actually practices what he preaches by including a multitude of great stories in this book that illustrate the key concepts.  (I've happily used a number of them already in various training sessions and speeches.) He also includes a lot of practical tools and tips.  The book is easy to pick up and put down.  I recommend it for anyone who wants to understand the art and uses of stories in business. 
 Be Your Own Pet will come to your town burn your house down, turn the sky brown, all because- all because, their on two wheels baby.  I love this album...and to address all the Jemina/Karen comments, I would say that I found Ms.Pearls vocals more derivitive of X-Ray Spex.  be your own pet takes no prisoners 
 Can be used for an in depth analysis of cultural norms around the world, or can be extremely handy as a quick reference before an important business trip or meeting.  This book will put you one step ahead 
 First of all, who the hell writes a book review without ever reading it?   Moving on, I would give limited praise for this book.  In terms of May's other work, it does not  surpass something like "the cry for  myth." I should like to bring to your attention that the book is a  collection of lectures and vary in their quality when transformed into  essays.  A few are thought provoking and a few are irrelevant and the rest  are in between.  It's worth reading if you enjoy existential psychology and  are curious about creativity.  If you just want to know about existential  psychology, choose a better book 
 The color film from the 1930's is of surprisingly good quality and the segments showing life in Germany at this time are quite interesting. An added bonus in the Special Features is a short promotional for Berlin from 1936 - in preparation for the summer Olympics held there that year.  Beautiful.  War related footage is good and most I had not seen before in 20+ years of collecting color video from WWII.  The minus, in my opinion, is the mournful, tragic tone of the British narration and funereal-sounding background music which cycles maddeningly over and over.  Subtly insulting to anyone who is knowledgeable about this period in history 
 In 1983 I entered teaching in West Virginia and recieved this book as a present from one of my teachers. In two years I moved to South Central to teach at 93rd Street School then into the Salinas valley and now in Oxnard.It has proved itself to be of great use to a teacher. I say this by way of explaining that as an elementary teacher, one working with a variety of settings, children, cultures, families, many kinds of educational issues I've come to believe that the book King wrote, this book, is a true helpmate to anyone trying to deal with inequity and injustice.Teaching is an act that requires a very deep understanding of who you are, your strengths, purpose, and this volume supports the evolution of your social conscious. For me the text allowed me to solidify who I am as a teacher and why I do what I do. One example might be the difficult job it is to teach in schools under assault for doing poorly, seemingly being deconstructed by politics without enough valid insight into ways to guide real improvement and coming up against ignorance in many forms-including the disparity in economic means permitted in America. It's not easy to teach children with vast dental decay, families out of work and watch a nation laud this as positive "welfare reform" when stranding these children in worse fixes. Sometimes I find it infinitly difficult to love my neighbor,well, my voucher loving neighbor, or even find commonality with those in million dollar homes feeling botox might make them both more appealing and more interesting.The child as a commodity construct which is now prevelent in educational dialog, among many other kinds of views, I find difficult to separate from the individuals telling me( in often rude and hurtful ways) that my efforts educationally are a failure and that schools don't work. In my world it's a constant Lou Dobbs immigration rant that somehow is hiding vaguely words that really seem to be saying something else. I tire of watching the reality of racism, classism acted out in the lives of children-and this is a fatigue that easily becomes anger-King speaks to this.... I find myself lacking the strength to love positions taken by those that really don't know what they are talking about, and don't care other than for personal advantaging anyway.... There is something truely fascinating about having a book that describes both your situation and your feelings as well as frames this into affective forward action-King can give you individual empowerment quite readily.And he can help you address your mindset. And that in this world of mine is a beautiful thing.  I frame my work with principles that are able to outweigh the personal likes and dislikes levels...so I bring to school dealings my thoughts that I am there to help Anthony be the best Anthony he can be...not to condemn Anthony to my judgement about him. Let us say then King's is an active lexicon and this volume is insightful for someone wishing to everyday face injustice and difficulty with positive reaction and action. For me as a person I find the book more helpful than any I ever had.  If anyone underestimates MLK's true intellectual ability, or simply wants to revisit the kind of person he was, a read of this book should serve to illustrate that America has had a prophet in my lifetime. Truely this should be required reading in high school and college programs for the young persons of our country to become acquainted with and use in working on social issues 
 I cannot praise this book enough.  First read it when I turned 13, on a trip to Mexico with my Mom, a long but wonderful adventure in itself.  I've read it just about every year ever since.  I've given multitudes away to children of friends, who, after these children had grown, remembered me as the one who gave them the best book they'd ever read.  Proud that the author was an architect, who kept me smiling as I worked through the nights on many of my own architectural projects in school, and later as I stepped out into the real world, searching for rhyme & reason, fighting off the lethargians, that horrible dapper ghoul with the tweezers.. 
 This book should be in the hands of every palm or handspring user. I never dreamed of how versatile these little gadgets can be. Some of the sections dealing with hardware are a bit dated and could use updating, but that aside this book is invaluable. There is no CD of software (that would sweeten the deal, wink, wink, nudge, nudge publisher) but the info relating to software and the URLs provided are still current. Expand your palm universe with this book. You will not regret it 
 A very romantic story. Somewhat graphic with quite of bit of swearing but in a low-key way. I read it and then read it again a few days later. Too long to read in one sitting. It made me cry 
 This is a must read book for anyone doing serious research.  Told with a sense of humor and encouragement 
 This is one of my favorite movies. It all starts out with a Jamaican man by the name of Derice Bannok, whose father was a famous Jamaican runner in the Summer Olympics. Derice practices running and could run just as fast as his father, but at the try-outs for the Olympics, he gets tripped and doesn't make it. But he doesn't give up there! He goes to the president of the Department of the Jamaican Olympic Team, and tries to get him to re-run the race, but he says no. Derice still wants to go to the Olympics, so, he tries to get together the first Jamaican Bobsled team. He tries to find Irving Blitzer, a man who used to be on the American Bobsled team, but got kicked out for cheating and went to Jamaica to get away from Bobsledding. Mr. Blitzer keeps refusing Derices offer, but then finally agrees to coach his team. I cant' tell you anymore because I don't want to spoil it for you. This movie is an instant comedy classic that anybody would love, and, it has great music, plus, it's based on a true story so it's very realistic. Five stars from me 
 If you use anabolic steroids or have been wondering about the steroid controversy, this reference guide and history of the drug will answer all your questions 
 I think Kenny Dorham is one of the most underrated horn players of all time and for me, Una Mas proves it.  Of all the many jazz recordings I own, this one constantly finds its way back to my CD-player time and time again.  I can't speak for the quality of the recording versus the vinyl original, but if you're able to look beyond the lack of snap, crackle and pop missing on this album you'll hear some very, very fine horn playing that merits rank among the greats 
 If you had one book to read on street survival- this would be it. Now, if your looking for a information on how to beat up the barroom bully or 5 easy moves that will make you undefeatable, this isn,t the book to read. If you really want to gain insight into the brutal reality of street violence and the the kind of mindset you need to deal with that reality, you will find it here. The only other book that comes close, in my opinion, is Walter Rauch's book. Most of this book deals with the use of weapons, so if the idea of arming yourself with a firearm or a weapon of opportunity repulses you, you won't like this book. The book does get very technical when discussing firearms. Even if you don't envision yourself evr using one, it's valuable information, because guess what: the person jacking you up on the street will probably have one! The author also stresses the single most important thing about survuving the streets- awareness. 
 Good reference book for anyone going through cosmetology training.  We purchased the book for my daughter to keep on hand at home since it's the same book used in her class at school.  It's very informative and helpful and will be a reference tool once she gets out on her own and needs to refer back to it.  I strongly recommend this book for anyone going into the field of cosmetology 
 This product is so great, it is my second one which I gave it as a gift to a friend.  They told me they love it. Good for making chinese egg rolls, spanish empanadas and much more 
 This is an amazing debut album from Singer/songwriter Scott Thomas and actor Balthazar getty. A blend of folk rock and the beats of an SP1200 make this unique band a 'must' listen to of 2006.  If you have purchased this album then i would highly recommend and suggest you give 'Lovers and Theives' by Scott Thomas from cdbaby.com/scottthomas a shot too. You wont be sorry.  This band is gonna be big.     
 It's not your typical "every fact known about the person" biography, but it's perhaps the best insight into Ronald Reagan that I've ever read.  Thank you, Peggy, for capturing and preserving the essence of Ronald Reagan 
 Why did Robert Wagner have a black eye throughout the first few episodes that not even makeup could hide 
 What I've been looking for so many years,absolutely excellent recording 
 This album has some of my favorite Muddy tunes. I almost get the feeling of being there. You can hear them having a good time jamming together, and you get a chance to hear Pinetop do a little singin' too. The quicker tunes are my favorite especially Caldonia and Kansas City. It makes me feel like I'm sipping Jackn'Coke in a bar. Makes me wanna dance 
 "Bang the Drum Slowly" is a line taken from the cowboy dirge "The Steets of Laredo" which is about a cowboy dying young."Bang the Drum Slowly" which is based on a novel by the same name, is about a dying dim-witted, country boy catcher and a sophisticated, star pitcher. The catcher (Pearson), played by Robert DeNiro, is dying from Hogkin's disease and the only one who knows about it is the Michael Moriarty character (Arthur). The story goes on how Arthur is suddenly nice to Pearson. No one knows why and everyone becomes more resentful of Pearson. Slowly everyone learns that Pearson is dying and starts to treat Pearson nicer. In addition, the team, a talented but bickering group of ballplayers,  are finally united because of Pearson's condition and go on to win the series. The continued subtle references to the business side of baseball pulls us back to the harsh reality of life and prevents the movie from being too corny. The movie is superb, but the DVD would have been better if some extras were included especially if there were something about history of free agency in baseball. $124,000 is not even the the base pay of today's rookie major leaguer, but in 1974 (when the movie was made) this was a huge amount of money. 1974 was also significant because this was the year that Andy Messersmith of the Dodger's challenged the reserve clause and became the first free agent 
 A Fascinating Character"      I'd heard the term "Stepin Fetchit," but I didn't know that there was a real person (Lincoln Perry) or movie star who used the name. So when a friend suggested I read this book I was leery. But after a few pages I was caught up in the times and in Perry's struggle to break into films and establish himself as a star. What surprised me most is that he was apparently an intelligent, gifted performer who was nothing like our picture of the "Uncle Tom" that the name is associated with. Who knew that Perry wrote for the Chicago Defender, fought for higher pay and better roles for black actors, hung out with the heavyweight champ Jack Johnson as well as Muhammad Ali, and, for years, lived such a lavish life in Hollywood. Watkins gives us a rich, detailed account of this complex, talented black comic actor. And when one reads about the racial restrictions and circumstances of black actors in the 1920s and 30s, the reasons for his being cast in the cartoonish movie roles he played become clear. He was a man before his time. I finished the book thinking that Perry, with his ambition and outrageous knack for publicity and self-promotion, could have been a star today. It seems that Perry had more flair and attitude than many of today's biggest stars.    This is an entertaining, eye-opening book - a great read. I recommend it for anyone interested in entertainment history or the bumpy road that black actors had to travel to become accepted in Hollywood, and for everyone who wants to be introduced to one of the most fascinating characters I've ever read about. Lincoln Perry's achievements need to be reevaluated and "Stepin Fetchit" definitely deserves * * * * * Five Stars.      
 As the owner of a deaf and partially blind Great Dane coincidentally name Grace, I loved this book.  Its very heart warming and endearing.  FYI, there is no such thing as an albino Great Dane though 
 When I ran out of light reading, I found BILLY STRAIGHT.   BILLY STRAIGHT became my first Jonathan Kellerman novel.  I can make several points that would be helpful for those who are seeking a good story.  In some respects, BILLY STRAIGHT is a "Stairway to Heaven" novel.   It starts off slow, almost painfully slow, gradually builds up and explodes with action at the end.   Over the years, I have learned that some great novels are start painfully slow - a characteristic which can drive me to stop reading.   Many times such slow moving storylines evolve into my favorite stories.   Thus, I have disciplined myself to read seemingly boring novels in hopes that the progression will change.   Such a shift in tempo generally happens with delightful results.  I like a storyline that seduces me to forget my environment.   I can get so involved in reading; I forget who I am and what I should be doing.  Occasionally, it is nice to forget what I am supposed to be doing.   At times, BILLY STRAIGHT offers that level of forgetfulness.   Other times, it doesn't.      I like a novel that creates pictures in my mind.   Sometimes authors have such a mastery of the written word, they create pictures in my mind which makes the reading experience like watching a movie.   Yet, good books are always better than good movies.   Good books have more to see!   At times, BILLY STRAIGHT offers that picture-creating quality.  Other times, it doesn't.   It is one of the most uneven novels I have read.  There are numerous better novels.   However, BILLY STRAIGHT outnumbers the inferior novels.   In the end, BILLY STRAIGHT ain't bad and I don't regret reading it. 
  This film is barly a science fiction film, it's more of a hodge podge of fantasy, old monster movies and fairy tales with many dream and surreal sequances.. City of Lost Children is more like the Wizard of Oz than like the Matrix, but is still dipped in enough science fiction jucies to suit my tastes. The plot revolves around a mad scientist, Krank (Daniel Emilfork), who lives off the coast of a surreal Dickensian French city in an old oil rig.   Krank does not have the ability to dream, and as a result he is prematurely old. In order to supplement his dream deficit, Krank kidnaps young children in order to study and extract their dreams. Unfortunately for Krank this is a self-fulfilling curse, as the experience of being kidnapped is so traumatic that the children have only nightmares. In pursuit of this scheme, Krank employs a sinister cult of blind men called "Cyclops" to perform the kidnappings.   In return for giving up their sight, the cult's neophytes are given a mechanical "third eye" and a device which makes their hearing unnaturally sensitive. This augmentation is as much a curse as it is a boon; at one point the audience may witness the discomfort of one Cyclops listening to Denree chomp his food. It is revealed that Krank is an artificially created man with superior intelligence. He was created by an inventor who also created six clones, a wife for himself (who later betrayed him), and a migraine-ridden brain in a jar named Irvin for him to interact with. Irvin's voice is supplied by Jean-Louis Trintignant; the Inventor and his clones are all played by Dominique Pinon.  The events of the film open with a sideshow strongman named One (Ron Perlman of hellboy fame) witnessing an orphan he cares for, named Denree (Joseph Lucien), being kidnapped by Krank's Cyclops. It later turns out that Denree is a special child, one able to provide Krank with the ability to overcome his condition (due to the fact that Denree has no sense of fear). One sets out to find and rescue his "little brother", with help of a nine-year-old street urchin girl named Miette (Judith Vittet) who holds the screen like no other child actress that I've seen.  Also in the film are a pair of Siamese twins known as "The Octopus". They run a thieves' guild in which they train and force orphans (one of whom is Miette) to steal for them. Due to unforseen circumstances, One gets caught up in a the theft of a large safe (which only he can carry). The end result of which is the orphans' failure to completely empty the safe.   Annoyed with this failure and Miette's subsequent decision to run off with One (Miette is their best thief) the Octopus seeks to destroy them. To this end they attempt to secure help from their former sideshow employer, whose trained fleas can inject poison into a person's scalp, inducing the victim to commit acts of violence when the flea-master plays his barrel organ and his scenes are the best in the movie.   Directed by the french duo of Jeunet & Caro who also did the yummy canniable flick "Delicatessen" (Jeunet later did Alien Reserection and the french film "Amelie") The story telling is wonderful the direction is flawless and the special effects are some of the best you could ever see in the mid 90's cinima. I don't know any one who has seen this film that doen't love it on some level. Yes, there are some confussing elements to it and takes some weird turns but this movie with all it's layers forces the movie goer to fill in the blanks and think outside the box to fully understand the complexites of this film...I've seen it a dozen times and I'm almost there! 
 This is one of the best books I have ever read, all the questions that you have about the bible about creation, man, sin, fallen angles, heaven, hell, enoch, the giants, the flood, and enoch's beautiful walk with God are answered 
 this is definately a must have for any QOTSA fans. they play stuff off of every album but play more off of the s/t and songs for the deaf than anything else. luckily they don't play much off of rated r (that album is definately the weak link). the sound quality is fantastic so don't be worried about that. it's got a bunch of bonus stuff when nick was still in the band.   the only reason why i only gave this 4 stars is because it was basically only one show with only one line up. i really would have liked to get better recordings (and better camera angles) of their older shows. oh well.  hopefully a kyuss dvd will eventually make it's way to shelves 
 I purchased the book when I was pregnant with my son in England.  I was so grateful for Jolly's no-nonsense approach to child rearing.  For example, Jolly explains in this book that babies don't really need to be burped.  Apparently, this is a Western society invention.  Few cultures outside of Western society pick their babies up and rub or tap their backs after they take their bottles because gas comes up normally.  He also said, "If your baby can take a bottle cold, straight from the refrigerator, then it's ok...there is no scientific reason for it to be warmed.  This also saved me hours of sleep since my son was happy to have a cold bottle.  The other pearl of wisdom that I loved was his advice to bring the baby in bed with you if you need to get some sleep.  My son breast fed in our bed and I went to sleep since I no longer needed to "burp" him afterwards.  Later, when we bottle fed him, we took the bottle right out of the refrigerator, fed him and then we all went to sleep in our double bed.  We would wake up and our son would have the middle ground and my husband and I would be in a V around him.  We all got more sleep that way and my son was a happy camper.  Jolly gives sound advice that makes parenting during that first year a heck of a lot easier.  I worshiped the man for letting parents off the hook.. 
 I bought these because I live with my ipod in my pocket, and was just sick of the cheap apple earbud things.  I am very impressed with the sound these put out.  They can handle whatever kind of music you throw at them, accurately and clearly.  I love the way the bass sounds too.  You can't beat these for the money, I'm a broke college student but I really needed something better and these delivered, especially for the cash.  I love em.  
 I have been obtaining this guide for a number of years and have found that its ratings the most helpful However, this year how it only awarded 'Brokeback Mountain' three stars is somewhat difficult to understand. Mick Martin might be homophobic 
 Hotel Vast Horizon marked Chris Whitley's return to the traditional guitar/bass/drums sound after experimenting with synths and drum loops on Rocket House. Chris's quiet vocals and very restrained guitar work along with the rhythm section's understated performance add to a very somber piece of music, a perfect album to chill out to.    As on nearly all of his albums, most of the songs are top notch. The opening tracks "New Lost World" and "Breaking Your Fall" are the most straight forward tracks while "Frontier" has a killer guitar line that is among his most memorable. "The Assassin Song" and the title song are both great tracks and continue the dreariness of the songs on Din of Ecstasy without the noisy arrangements. The rhythm section of bassist Heiko Schramm and drummer Matthias Macht are strong throughout but are at their best when adding a jazz feel to the tracks "Blues For Andre" and "Silhouette." Another great track is "Wide Open Return" which like "Silhouette" is very soothing, sounding like something you'd hear when hanging out on an island. The instrumental "Free Interval" shows Whitley's mastering of the banjo and is actually the most upbeat song here. The only misstep here is "Insurrection At Newtown" which is a good song but sounds out of place with its contemporary drum sounds. All told, a very strong album ranking among his best work. 
 Be prepared to be unable to stop laughing! The title story was my favorite, tied with "Litter String" (which is one of several stories written from the POV of Babycakes the cat). I can't wait to read more by this fantastic writer! 
 Spliffs is written in british english so some of the slang may not make sense but don't let that sway you this is a great book. Including practically anything you ever wanted to know about marijuana and the delicate art of rolling spliffs (or joints). First read up on you marijuana history and learn things you never knew about your favorite smokable. Next take a look at an incredable collection of buds and hash from all around the world. Now after you clean up the puddle of drool at your feet you can experiment with some extraordinary joint rolling techniques. Although these can often be very time consuming they will make you the center of attention and get you way way way too stoned. You wont put the book down, that is untill your muscles have tensed up from excessive toking.  Everything that a smoker of marijuana could ask for. Buy it for your friends, your roommates, your boss or yourself. You wont regret it 
 This is a refreshing book. Read it, relax and enjoy. On top of that, you can share it with your teenagers and know that they won't get any bad ideas from it. I read through the book in a few days and was planning on donating it to my church library. But then my 12-year-old picked it up and started reading it. He loved it! He has no interest in dating yet but he got a kick out of the characters and the crazy road trip. When he is ready to date, I'm hoping he'll remember Gabe and how much Gabe wanted to do the right thing 
 A few months ago I acutally had a chance to meet Knine at the taping of "Mix Master's Lounge" a new Holy hip hop variety show currently airing on INSP cable station.  He definitely loves the Lord with his shining and most humble Spirit.  This project is the best I've ever heard, from the lyrics to the beats. This was definitely needed for ALL 
 This book provides a snap-shot of film-making at the end of the century. The story of Star Wars episode I's crafting in 150 pages. Packed with detail. Short quotes from people involved, from cast to crew, pepper the  text adding colour and information. Well illustrated, clearly told and  attention grabbing. Thorough in its scope and ecomomic in language, good  reading and eminently collectible. A suitable companion to Thomas Smith's,  Industrial Light and Magic: The Art of Special Effects (1986), which  covered much on the special effects of episodes IV-VI. A contribution to  the myth of Star Wars 
 Not a bad  little unit at all. Has some really cool effects, amp models, and the wah pedal works well. For some reason amazon doen't sell the Line 6 FP Ultra model. I found one at "Musicians Friend" , but it was $125.00 more and on back order. For $200.00, I think this little guy is well worth the mone 
 I was particularly taken by this very sad story and in fact read it again, almost a year later (something I rarely do).  The author had everything it takes to keep my interest and make the story real enough to haunt me for a long time.  This is an excellent memoir 
 I just got my gazelle set up and used it for the first time. Set up was a little iffy...definitely read all through the instructions before you begin. Use is very simple! Mine came with the DVD, and since I don't have a player, am not able to use that. However, the instructions in the owner's manual for the different moves are easy to understand. I inherited 'faulty knees', so was anxious to see how "low-impact" this would really be. It's great! 
 I bought these for my elderly Father who doesn't hear very well. Lets just say, I'm the favorite Son once again 
 I think this game is great.  I remember playing it at the arcade in the early 80's.  My sister and I were addicted to it.  After a while it faded away and we missed it.  My daughter bought me this game and I was so like a kid again.  I am enjoying it to the hilt.  It is definately worth the money that it cost, which was surpisingly inexpensive.  I recommend it highly, especially for those who remember it back when.  
 The only thing better than reading the essays and seeing the full-color plates was to have been to the exhibit in person.  The art is fascinating.  The exploration of these artist's intentions and influences is inspiring.  This is a first-rate publication that accompanied a first-rate exhibition.  
 the thing about this confuses me, kevin smith claims that this was a box office flop . but most of the kevin smith fans think mallrats is the best (i think different but is the second best) im haveing a hard time figureing out why it was sutch a big flop.  
 I must say I have never read a book by Leah Hager Cohen but this must take the cake! It is absolutely inthrawling. It used great imagery and at times made my head spin with flashbacks! I loved the book...until the end! I must say Heart, You Bully, You Punk seemed to end rather abruptly...but all in all its a rather good book. 
 My preschoolers LOVE this CD.  Every kid should know the words to Here Comes Peter Cotontail and be taught how to do the chicken dance and the bunny hop for Easter!  
 I bought this book because I saw it for sale when I was in Hawaii, but didn't want to carry it home with me and risk the chance of it getting banged up in transit.  The photos are beautiful.  The only thing I don't like about this book is that some of the photos run from one page to the next, which means that there's a big crease down the center of some of the really great photos.  It's a great coffee table book, especially for those of us who live far from the ocean and need a reminder of its beauty 
 Russo's characters are just a bit more than the folks in your home town...he has a way of describing them so I could visutalize them right away!  The situations in a small Maine town, whose main industry has vanished, bring home the pathos of many small towns who have had similar situations.  The matriarch who runs the town, not very secetly, is a fascinating woman, whose crippled daughter loves the hero, whose wife has left him for a sexier man, who isn't all he can be.  There is a lost boy, a sheriff who grew up in the town, who has a son...the typical high school jock/bully.  There is a river whose waters could tell the entire history of the town.  Excellent character building, love-hate relationships, and a really good story made me recommend this to my book club of 147 members, most of whom also read and enjoyed this book 
 Not for the faint hearted. Readers can expect to suffer through numerous footnotes, and liberal sprinklings of quotes in Greek, Latin, French and German. That is not to say that the author has done a poor job. The content is very informative, just slow reading.  The author has provided a well put together, bien tenu, history of piracy in the Mediterranean from ancient times to the formation of the Roman empire, first century A.D. based upon the writings of semi-contemporary authors and ancient authors, such as Xenophon, Cicero, Plutarch and such. The content was originally published in 1924 by the Liverpool University Press. The two maps attached to the end of the text are very helpful at finding the many locations cited by the author.  Bottom line, be prepared for a non-trivial read. P- 
 This gets good marks simply because it is such an interesting, involving story that hooks you right away and every time you watch it and doesn't overwhelm you with violence and gore.  Denzel Washington is appealing as always as the good guy and John Goodman is surprisingly low-key for most of the movie. All the characters are very interesting and the special effects are creepy. The story is pure "Hollywood theology" mean also means the characters - include the heroes - in here have no clue about God or the purpose of life.   The DVD provides excellent entertainment. The visuals are decent on this disc and sound-effects are chilling in spots. As the demon sees through the eyes of people and passes by with these "whoosh" sounds, it's very effective. As mentioned, the film doesn't need a lot of violence to succeed with it's horror-type tale.   One note about the final scene.  if you get confused, you aren't alone. Maybe I'm not too bright because it took me a couple of viewings to see it all in perspective 
 Quaint and loveable... What more can someone ask from a comic strip? "Mutts" is everything a comic strip should be: amusing, of course, and extremely heart-warming 
 Great Plot!  A crooked president who only thinks of himself and his needs; a good hearted man named Dave who thinks about others, and the only thing they have in common is their outward appearance. Dave is called upon to sit in for the president and do his job for a while.  Two of the presidents regular staff try to get Dave to do things that is contrary to Dave's character.  So the story goes on from there.  Who will win the battle of crooked verses good in the White House. This dvd  picture was good and clear, the sound was great, and the case was in excellent condition.  If you like warm hearted type movies, then this is the one for you.  I know I have enjoyed it over and over.  To me, Dave is about character, good or bad, and the choices we make in life that can affect others around us. 
 Warner Home Video announced that they will be releasing all three movies soon, probably around Christmas this year.  I'd wait til then to buy the DVDs.  The videos will probably be cheaper then also 
 The coolest set of songs you'll ever lose your hearing to! Every track is awesome and it is the most well-known Misfits release.A great buy for any fiend. What else can you say about one of the greatest punk albums ever made 
 After looking through this book, I felt I found the ultimate bread baking guide.  Not only are there a ton of great recipes, but there are other tips, techniques, and problem solutions I've never found in any other book on bread baking.  My only complaint and it's a mild one at that, is the lack of pictures.  But then, I'm a picture person.  The directions could not be plainer even for the beginner.  I was so pleased with it, I sent a copy for my sister in Texas.  Patrick McGowan/Escondid 
 As much as I read and forget to write reviews, everyone above did a fine job of explaining the storyline itself.  However, the final piece moved too fast.  With all the work the author did to get us to that point, I was hoping for more with the final character interacting with Detective Rizolli. (I am trying not to spoil anything).  She left a few stones unturned in the storyline but overall I would still reread this book.  Which coming from me is a good thing.  Most get read once and I move along.  This goes in the keep pile for future reading 
 As one who doesn't understand Spanish beyond "por favor," I have to say that Syntek has been filling a void in the musical and emotional wasteland of today's popular music.  Like several of his other albums, there is not one bad track on "Mundo Lite."  (Save for the Techno version of "Duele El Amor.")  For those who love music in its purest form, this will take your breath away.  Latin or mainstream, there is nobody comparable to Aleks Syntek in today's music scene 
 I read this book with the hope of understanding the direction in which History is moving. The historical analysis of the decline of the Hapsburgs or the travails of the Napoleonic era interested far less than did the last chapter devoted to giving some sense of the world at the time the book was written. 1987. At that time and even perhaps more so now there is endless talk and debate about the question of whether the world's only superpower is moving toward greater hegemony, or perhaps to decline and then disaster. One only needs to survey the attitudes of most nations to the United States today to see that it has never been more hated and demonized than today. Kennedy is more interested in analysis of economic, military and ultimately political relations. The implicit conclusion of his book made by most readers at the time it was first published was that he was really predicting an inevitable American decline. In other words all the historical chapters were really preparation for the speculative chapter on America's future. And this though Kennedy made certain to hedge and distinguish clearly between the historical analysis and the speculation.  Now as I write this in January 2005 a couple of days after President Bush's second inaugural calling for a new birth of liberty throughout the world I wonder what Kennedy surmises. The great US productivity boom that came in the nineties, the great prosperity, the total military dominance displayed by the US seemed to suggest that Kennedy's picture of US decline was mistaken. But today in a time of massive deficit budgets, with an economically revived and increasingly powerful Europe, with China growing at such a rapid rate there is the question of how long the superpower can hold on. The emeging great superpower China seems to be threatening US interests in many places, and perhaps will eventually replace it as leader of the world.  My own sense is that Kennedy aware of the place of surprise in history by no means expected his work to be taken as an argument for America's inevitable decline. However anyone who reads his book will have a strong sense of how the mighty have fallen in the past, and how their successors may fall in the future. And this raising the question of how American can be wise so as to not fall. And here Kennedy's suggestion seems to be the very opposite of what President Bush suggests. Kennedy warns against overextending oneself, and President Bush seems ready to extend and extend in a quest to defeat the terrorists who would topple the United States. 
 Teenage Fanclub is one of those bands who garners a lot of respect from critics, maintains their high level of indie cred, but can still put out songs with lyrics like "When you tick I'll be your tock" and not really be self-effacing about it.  The song I just mentioned is "Sidewinder", the album is Bandwagonesque, and the band is simply one of the best that 90's power pop (or any kind of pop/rock) had to offer.  Starting out as a considerably noisier band on indie label Matador, Teenage Fanclub dropped a bit of the grungy sound and went for pure pop, Big Star style.  Sure, the guitars still have a bit more fuzz than anything on #1 Record, and there's still some silly Sonic Youth style white noise on the instrumental "Satan," but for the most part these Scottish popsters nail it.  Would be my record of the year for 1991 but there was darn tough competition that year (Adam Schmitt's "World So Bright" takes the prize).  Pick this up if you are a fan of great harmonies, ringing guitars, and all-around great, melancholy pop tunes.  Best Tracks:  "December" - One of the greatest all time Fanclub songs that never gets the recognition of other popular tracks.  This is one of those somber but still sugary sweet tunes they do so well. "What You Do To Me" - Pure Alex Chilton.  Fanclub defines their reason for being in about 1:50. "Sidewinder" - A book called "Bubblegum Music is the REAL Truth" called this one of the definitive bubblegum songs of the 90s - Brains + humor + sugar = perfect pop. "Alcoholiday" - Considerably more somber & depressing...see Greenberry Woods' "Punch Drunk," and add a purely gorgeous outro. "Guiding Star" - Harmonies in full force on this Beach Boys/early Shoes-styled charmer.  Strings, synths, just a great song that shows they can still tear it up without guitar or drums 
 This review is for the Millennium edition DVD only. A great transfer to a classic with excellent bonus material for the Millennium edition DVD. This movie has more atmosphere and chills than new films costing 100 times what it cost to make this classic gem. The acting is nothing special, but the mood and atmosphere are sure to send chills up your spine. If you love horror movies this is a must have DVD 
 It is rare to say but so true. It was given to me by an older woman and it truely changed the way I parent my two boys, see life and helped me create a summer that I will treasure. A must read for those who want to slow down and get off the "treadmill" of life. 
 The first time I saw this riotious movie was at The RKO Theatre in Washington D.C. the first weekend it appeared. It made me laugh then and still makes me laugh some forty years later. It's Peter Sellers portraying a master thief and mommas boy in a script penned by Neil Simon, directed by one of the princes of Italian cinema, Vittorio DeSica, shot in Rome and the Amalfi Coast. We see Sellers, (The Fox!) concoct a scheme to break out of prison to comfort his mother and try and control his sister (played by Mrs. Sellers,Britt Ecklund) while on the outside The Fox hatchs a plan to steal the gold of Cairo (lots of gold bricks). Many great Italian character actors and a very funny matinee idol, Victor Mature as "Tony Powell", a name repeated a hundred time for comic effect. It's $11.90 plus shipping, that's about what you would pay to see "Duece Bigelow" at your movie house and this is many times funnier-I'm guessing 
 Fever 1793, Laurie Halse Anderson Imagine you're alone on a deserted street. Piles of dead bodies lay on the side of the street. Market places are empty. Young children cry behind broken windows. The steady buzz of mosquitoes fills the air. These were the streets of Philadelphia, the new capital of the United States, in 1793 when the yellow fever epidemic swept through the city, killing thousands.  Only a few months ago the town had thrived. Market places were busy, children played in the street and Matilda Cook happily helped her mother run the Cook coffee house. Then word got out about the " fever. " People started dieing. Matilda's friend Polly died before she even knew she was sick.  Before long it gets worse. People flee the city. Church bells ring constantly. Before she knows it Matilda's world is turned upside down and she finds herself alone and losing the fight to survive. Share Mattie's feelings of hopelessness, grief, joy and love as she slowly stitches her life back together  Great for historical fiction fans or anyone who likes a realistic adventure that will leave them on the edge of their seats. With real people and places, it's an enjoyable history class.  Savannah S. 
 Tom Broadbent is out enjoying the desert when he hears gunshots.  He finds a dying prospector who gives him a notebook with instruction to give it to no one but his daughter.  Tom, am man of his word, keeps knowledge of the notebook form the police and sets out to figure out who the prospector was so that he can locate his daughter.  The book is full of numbers like a code so Tom enlists the help of a code breaker now studying to be a monk.  But the numbers aren't a code but readings from a ground radar machine.  Compiled, the numbers show a picture of a almost mummified dinosaur fossil.  The find is incalculable but there is no information about where it is.  Meanwhile the forces behind the prospector's death have recovered a sample of the fossil but need the notebook to locate the main find.  One of these forces is ruthless and willing to kill.  He suspects Tom has the information and sets out to get it.  This are complicated even more as the fossil is somehow related to a shadowy organization connected with the final Apollo mission and something discovered on the moon.  All of these forces begin to come together as Tom tries to carry out the promise he made to a dying man.  It will not be easy for Tom or his wife to survive this but they keep trying.  It all comes together in the end in a satisfying way.  There are elements of this book that seem influenced by Preston's work with Lincoln Child.  It is easy to see elements of THUNDERHEAD, THE ICE LIMIT and any books dealing with natural history museums.  This book, like his collaborative efforts, is well paced, imaginative and entertaining.  Watching all of the plot threads come together at the end is almost a pleasure to watch.  Almost because the reader will want to pay attention to the story's revelations and not the author's mastery of the writing craft.  If you have enjoyed any of Preston's other books you are sure to enjoy this one.  Check it out 
 I love T.S. Eliot's work. Eventhough this is written for children, there are still elements in the story that pertains to adults. The lyrical form just flows like water and even if you are not a cat lover, this book will make you think differently 
 First off, I am an animal lover.  I've had pets most of my life so this book is very much like preaching to the choir.  It would be hard for me to believe that my pets, and animals in general, do not have emotions.  I thought this book would be black & white concerning that issue but it is very fair to the opinion that animals do not have emotions.  The title suggestions that the opinion of this author is animals are emotional however she offers several stories and possibilities to keep the book balanced.  I learned quite a lot from this book.  It leans towards "animals are emotional" but it's not as black & white as I thought which made the book very interesting  I got this book because I wanted to read lots of stories of animals and their emotions but I didn't exactly get that.  The first couple of chapters are void of emotional animal stories and once the book finally does start with the stories, they are lacking details.  I felt as though the author wanted to get as much in as possible.  Quantity over quality.    I'm still giving this book a good rating because I did have a great time reading it 
 This series is awesome, and I am incredibly happy to have it to watch over and over.  It speaks to the depths of the soul of a man.  Having experienced intense pain, though not in war, I find the emotion and the comeradery very intensely satisfying in this series.  This bonding is what men were meant to do, not just in war, but in our every day battles.  The sense of brotherhood among people with only one major event in common is instructional.  I recommend this for any group of buddies, or even church groups 
 This novel is (forgive me for a regrettably trite analogy), like rich chocolate cake. It can either be devoured with a fiery voracity or savoured for its intricate nuances, and, in fact, should be read in both ways. The extremely complex and suggestive web of motifs present in Ondaatje's masterful work makes this novel tasty and satisfying the second and even third time through. I have heard it criticized for excessive sentimentality and romanticism, but that is exactly what is needed in response to the desolate emotional wasteland of a post-war world. Additionally, the end of the novel, I think, might disabuse many cold cynics of such notions. In any case, a striking, artistic masterpiece that would be a disgrace to overlook 
 This book is a primer for anyone who wants coaching in how to structure your life to maximize your success. The coaching is scientifically oriented, yet the book is imminently practical. Science is used to describe and explain the benefits of the suggested techniques, not to challenge the reader. More specifically, science is used to support numerous non-scientific coaching concepts, which could not be scientifically explained until recently. We [...] recommend this book to  business people who want to maximize their mental energy in a way that improves their chances of success 
 If you enjoyed the movie "The Color of Money" try the book from which it is loosely based.  Not giving anything away, there is no Tom Cruise character, nor his movie girlfriend.  If you are an "early to mid-boomer" you may especially relate to this work even if your eyes glaze over at the mention of "pool".  If you read/saw "The Hustler", even better 
 I found Monster Island first and really enjoyed the dark desolate overtones that novel put out.  So reading the next book in the series was a must.  While Monster Island takes place after the world has been overrun, this novel takes place before and during.  The book starts with a bang and just keeps on going at a pretty good pace.  There's not too much talking nor is there excessive action.  It's a well balanced novel in my opinion.  The author does put his own spin on the rise of the zombies which jives with his first novel.  I thought it worked out pretty well given that every zombie novel wants to always deal with "why did this happen?"  I would definitely recommend this novel.  And you don't have to start with Monster Island either.  
 I was unable to even find any male/female extension USB cables at my local bricks & mortar stores, and the male/male cables available cost an arm and a leg.   These cables are extraordinarily low priced, arrived in the blink of an eye, fit perfectly, are of heavy construction, and work like a charm. I couldn't be happier 
 A breezy, yet detailed book on making your workplace goddess friendly and dealing with everyday, mundane reality in magical ways 
 I love thi sling for many reasons but the top three are the following: 1) my baby calms down right away when she's carried in it.  2) she doesn't get scared of strangers when we visit new people or go to a party (she's in the middle of the stranger anxiety phase).  3) Most of all it helps nursing really discretely in public without ovrheating my baby. Before Itried to use all kinds of blankets and scarves but my baby was getting so swaty and hot. instead the fabric of maya wraps is very breathable and my baby remains at a comfortable temperature, even in Texas

 I bought this for Christmas for my 32 yr. old daughter. She loved it. 
 Being the "Orientalist" that I am, I simply loved "A Passage to India" E.M Foster does an excellent job on character development and the relationships that build up to fall; then of course, build up again. The entire book is a rollercoaster of friends and foes. The book will keep you puzzled at who really is the antagonist and protagonist of the story.  The book has many symbolic meanings within itself that deal with humanity and conflict in general.  My favorite character in the book was Mr. Fielding. He related to my own character in so many ways. He seemed to be one of the few who wanted to understand the Indians (Muslim and Hindu).  The book is dealing with the conflict that the British and Indian people had when the British Raj was in power. Looking from both sides of the spectrum, it really exposes the prejudice one had for another. Not only is it a matter of separation in India by the Indian and British, but it also deals with another internal conflict in India with Muslims and Hindus. Truly, it was a divided India.  While sometimes a tedious read, "A Passage to India" plays out to be a very well-written story full of rich history, interesting characters, and very opinionated peoples. This book is highly recommended to anyone who would like to understand some very interesting customs of India. Check it out 
 Great all around soft board book for toddlers! It even has a matching photos game in the back.  My son loves photos of trucks so this was a perfect gift for him.  If your child loves photos of cars, trucks, trains and tractors this is a great pick.  It has the most photos of "Things that Go" than any other book I have purchased on the size scale.  Great buy if you ask me 
 When I first got the "Feeding" CD by American Head Charge I felt that I was listening to a band that was moving away from the nu-metal style and instead were employing a more industrialized groove that at times reminded me of Marilyn Manson or even Nine Inch Nails. I was brought to this conclusion by the way singer Martin Cock handled his vocals from soft subtlety and then to raging yells. The riffing of the guitar and mixing in of keyboards transform this from being a run of the mill band. Kicking you right in the face with this is "Loyalty" which is one of my fave tracks on the CD. It's a great mix of Metal attitude and Melodic harmony. "Dirty" is another fierce number and a staple in the bands live performance. The band is definitely versatile and on tracks like "Ridicule" I was almost reminded of Faith No More at times in the track. The lineup for the recording is as follows: Martin Cock (vocals), H.C. Banks (bass), Bryan Ottoson (guitar), Chris Emery (drums) and Justin Fowler (keyboards) and a solid lineup it is. Friends for years the band first unleashed their brand of mayhem on the world with 2001's "The War Of Art" and appeared on that same year's Ozzfest.   So who should look into AHC? Pretty much anyone who enjoys a certain level of in-your face intelligent Metal that often defies the convention of their peers. There is very little to disappoint on the CD and after repeated listens and seeing them live I found myself enjoying the music a little bit more. The packaging is loaded with the lyrics and offer a little insight into the demons the band is often singing about. Sadly, the group suffered the loss of guitarist Bryan Ottoson while died will on tour with Mudvayne. Since that time the band has vowed to carry on in his name the way he would have wanted them to. Check out this very interesting group and try to catch a show if they come around your way.  
 Whatever you think of the man, Bono is something else. Here we get some genuine insight into what makes this extraordinary individual tick. The series of dialogues between the Irish singer and old friend French writer Michka Assayas covers just about everything you can think of with intelligence and humour. At one point they discuss that these conversations themselves may be some kind of therapy for Bono since the relatively recent death of his father.  From his troubled adolescence and the death of his mother, to his recent first-hand experiences of international economics and politics, to his relationship with God and Christianity, Bono reveals all. Meetings with the Pope, George W. Bush, President Gorbacev calls round for Sunday lunch, there are some fascinating bits and pieces! Just as he appears on the point of pomposity or pretentiousness, out comes a quote from Monty Python, or a self-deprecating U2 story.  For a millionaire rock star, Bono comes across as remarkably in touch with reality and with his feet firmly on the ground. In fact it is astonishing that he appears to be so in touch with so many different realities, and still have a healthy sense of perspective. One senses a clear-headed ambition to achieve an ongoing balance between idealism and realism. 
 I like this album very much.  If you enjoyed intensly moody classical such as the soundtracks to Howards End, Out of Africa, or Cinema Paradiso, you will love this 
 This is the second book of Lencioni that I've read (along with "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team"), and they have both been accessible and applicable to my role as a leader and team member.  One of the biggest appeals of "The Five Temptations" is that it can be read in one sitting or within a few days.  That makes the concepts easy to digest.    Lencioni writes in a fictional style that reads like an interesting story but is packed with great leadership principles.  Though I'm not the CEO of a large corporation, the truths in the story are still applicable to my own leadership situations.    I have also heard Lencioni speak, and his speaking is as good or better than his writing.  He manages to transfer profound leadership concepts into ways that any leader can understand and apply.  I look forward to continuing to learn from him and reading more of his books in the future.  In any case, I recommend "The Five Temptations. 
 This is another of those Dylan records that belongs in the top five. My dad told me that everybody was taken completely by surprise when "JWH" came out. Bob Dylan had come back from his motorcycle accident completely reinvented, but I don't know why his fans were so blown away, he'd reinvented himself once before, they should have just accepted it, or at the very least gotten used to it, because Mr. Dylan has been reinventing himself for a long time now. Anyway this record was recorded with county musicians and has a country flavor to it, even though the songs like "The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest," "All Along the Watchtower," "Down along the Cove" and the rest of the masterpieces on this album are anything but country. That'll come though, because Dylan reinvents himself still again for his next release.  Reviewed by Stephanie San 
 If you're looking for a well-written fast-paced Catholic fictional novel within the genre of "mystery" that will strengthen your own faith, this is a great buy and a great read.  At points, I could not put the book down - I would say up for hours at night in the same position on the couch reading voraciously.  Yes, it's 596 pages, but that's illusional; it reads as if it is much shorter.  At the time of writing this review, Amazon is selling it for $10.85, which is a steal - so what are you waiting for 
 This is mystery romance novel about stolen art and the mix of romance between the burglary and art proprietor. The secondary story of alcoholic brother and his first love had some wonderful moments. The mystery was great and I didn't have a clue who the killer was until it was unveiled. I would recommend this novel and 'The Villa' by Nora Roberts's 
 This is a very interesting, well written book. I am thoroughly enjoying it.  Modern culture challenges us with tough problems and the solutions are seldom obvious or easy.  Renewing American Culture gives me a solid framework for thinking about these issues and offers great hope for the future.  My only problem is that it would be a richer experience to read Renewing American Culture as part of a book club or group discussion.  It's the kind of book that makes you want to talk about what you're reading 
 This is a concise collection of Smith's adventures that is interspersed with Smith's own words.  The piece is well organized and written, and most importantly provides insight into the mindset, motive, and philosophy of Smith and the early American settlers.  It certainly provides the reader with a greater understanding of how America has become what it has.  And how it will continue be the land where individual spirit is rewarded 
 Alan faces off against the number one consulting killer...success. How to Acquire Clients provides practical advice on all areas of a practice: stealing clients, negotiating, dealing with buyer barriers, committees, etc. The best aspect of the book for me is that none of the aspects are impossible to implement. You can buy the book today and immediately put the strategies into action 
 This is a great toy for 3 to 4 year olds, but I wish the set contained more tracks.  It makes a very small loop.  The nice thing is you can make and add other Duplo structures to this which makes each use a new set-up

 It's easy to remember Woody Hayes as a brutal tyrant on the football field, who was able to turn on his country charm for the media and fans away from it.  A folk hero and coaching icon who was tragically brought down by personal demons in the form of a punch to an opposing player during a football game.  But how does a man like Woody Hayes become the stuff of legend?  I think that in order to understand a man, you have to know where he came from.  A Fire To Win is more than just a recounting of the same stories we've heard over and over.  The book takes us on a journey through a man's life in order that we may understand him, even if we don't agree with him.   A brutal tyrant, yet mentor, academic advisor, and friend.  A staunch conservative, yet defender of student's rights to rage against the machine.  A man who recognized the value of power, but cared not for the money associated with it.  A preacher of family values who rarely came home from work.  An enigma to be sure, but when seen over the light of a lifetime, somehow, his choices make sense.  The infamous punch is of course perhaps the single most defining moment in the life of Woody Hayes.  One may think that this is where the story ends.  A Fire To Win takes us well beyond this moment to witness the remarkable resurrection of a remarkable man.  Fittingly, this is where the real story ends.  A Fire To Win is a fascinating read about the life of the enigma, icon and flawed hero that was Woody Hayes 
 Political scandals, judicial controversies and an extortion plan that will make three disgraced former judges very rich and powerful men make up this fast-paced thriller.   The Brethren have waited for just the right time--the right moment. And that moment has come. While the country is distracted by a presidential election with its own ulterior motives, the three judges have targeted their next victim.  I found this novel to be very entertaining and pure Grisham at his best. His characters are multi-dimensional, human and evil, and exploit the adage of "how far are you willing to go to get what you want?'  Still, my favorites remain The Client and The Pelican Brief.  Overall, John Grisham packs a punch and hits his target every time. Kudos!  ~Cheryl Kaye Tardif,  Author of Whale Song (978-1-897339-02-2) January 2007 Kunati Books www.kunati.com or www.cherylktardif.com  
 I read a positive review of this book in a business column in my local paper and ordered it. I enjoyed reading the book and especially like the metaphor the author used. Who doesn't know about King Arthur and the Round Table? And what a great metaphor to use in relaying the concept of good communication in the business world. There are good tips throughout the book on how to bring your company together and how to make it work. I recommend this book and Good to Great for every manager or director 
 "Flush" is one of Alice's best LP's, hands down. Those who were disappointed with it were too busy looking for something else. This record is straight-forward rock with a bit of a new-wave era flavor. No ballads, anthems, or shockers here. In other words, not what many had come to expect from Alice Cooper, but ten quick and gutsy rockers averaging slightly less than three minutes a piece with some pretty hilarious lyrics. While all the songs are great, the ones I love the best are "Model Citizen", "Pain", and "Clones".  Saw the "Flush the Fashion" show at NY's Palladium in '81, and thought it was great. The overall feel was sort of like the "West Side Story" tone of the "School's Out" LP with a bit of a "Clockwork Orange" twist. Very stripped down in comparison to the extravaganzas Alice is known for, but not a disappointment 
 If you love the "neo-hippie" type music, then moe. is for you.  I have been listening to "No Doy" for a number of years and I loved it.  But this album "Headseed" tops it.  It's great.  The  effects are awesome and a must have for all you stoners out there 
 For those seeking to integrate Christian moral virtues with intellectual virtues this is a must read.  Wood argues that the virtuous life leads to our ability to lead excellent lives.  This is acomplished in us by persuing  intellectual virtue and its habits (intellectual honesty, love for truth,  etc) along side the quest for moral virtues at the same time.  Wood argues  that "According to the Christian tradition, to forge virtuous habits  of moral and intellectual character is part of what is required for us to  grow to teh full stature of all that God intends for humans to be."

 I first knew of Anderson and Sabatelli's works through the professional journals in family studies and family therapy. I used the instrument "Differentiation in the Family Systems Scale (DIFS)" developed by them in my master's thesis research. Their approach is mostly influenced by Murray Bowen's family system  theory. In this text, they again use the Bowenian theory as a grounding framework, combined with structural family theories (i.e. Salvador Minuchin, David Olson's circumplex model..etc.). The authors did an excellent job of integrating existing family science literature. For example, in chapter II--family strategies, they propose six universal strategies families employ to meet developmental tasks during the family life cycle: developing identity, regulating boundary, maintaining resources, managing emotions, and coping with stress. Then, these strategies were used to illustrate family interaction patterns in different family developmental stages throughout the chapters in Part III. The last part disscusses four alternative family developmental pathways. I find the chapter on death, loss, and bereavement is especially insightful. Unfortunately, gay and lesbian relationships were not included here (nor in the "family diversity" chapter). That makes the book somewhat incomplete. However, I find the text is very suitable for introductory family courses, especially for those who prefer psychological approach rather than traditional sociological approach. This book is also recommended for family therapy students as the foundamental knowledge base. Though I left the graduate school few years ago and am a counselor now, I still find some concepts in the book very refreshing and useful for clinical conceptualization. I give this book a very high praise

 I'm not really a musician, so I can't compare this book or its method to other books on the same subject.  But I found this book very clear and understandable and I read it all the way though, did all the exercises.  And it taught me a lot.  This really is an excellent book, and I would recommend it to anyone who can read music but doesn't know the theory behind it 
 DOWN ARGENTINE WAY is a fun movie, plain and simple. It's a lighthearted Romeo and Juliet-esque story with a not so tragic ending. Betty Grable stars as Glenda Crawford, the fun loving daughter of a well to do industrialist. She spends most of her days looking at horses and chumming around with her amusing Aunt Binne (Charlotte Greenwood). She meets Ricardo Quintana, the son of a horse breeder from Argentina. She falls in love with him and hopes to buy a horse from him, but the deal falls through when Ricardo realizes that she is the daughter of his father's enemy. He snubs her, she doesn't understand why, so she and Aunt Binnie travel to Argentina so that she can slap his face. Of course she slaps his face, and the film progresses as one would expect--the two fall in love and all ends happily. While the basic plotline is predictable, it's fun to see just how the film will be resolved.  Of course most people who buy this film are not all that interested in the story, and will overlook its flaws: bad Spanish accents, what would be considered derogatory stereotypes if the film were made today and a few confusing characters. The singing and dancing numbers are what musical lovers enjoy, and this has some great moments. For one, we see Carmen Miranda starring as Carmen Miranda. How the Brazilian Bombshell ends up in Argentina we never know, but she's at a nightclub and she's the city's main entertainment attraction and it's fun to watch. We also see the Nicholas Brothers dance a  tap number that doesn't seem all that Latino in flavor, but it's the Nicholas Brothers so we really don't care, we are just amazed at how they can move as they do. There's also a great number involving Aunt Binne. She and her escort arrive at a street festival and everyone in the festival seems pleased that this well to do WASP from New York decides to sing a song about courting a senorita. Charlotte Greenwood's moves are comical and skillful and it's the sort of scene you watch over and over. Betty Grable and Don Ameche hold their own as the stars, and their musical and dance numbers are good too.   In the end, DOWN ARGENTINE WAY is an enjoyable movie with great musical numbers that make it worth the price alone. 
 This slim volume has a some nice features that make up for a lack of illustrations and model photos, including a clever pentagon template, tips for cutting equilateral triangles & hexagons, and suggestions for cutting multiple pieces for the projects. I especially enjoyed working with the triangle, simple square, and the spike ball modules, which I used to make solid, satisfying models.  The "triangle edge module" can be used to make a nice tetrahedron or an icosahedron (which helped me see the relationship between that shape and a dodecahedron).  I skipped a couple of spiky models that required glue, but  I was generally very pleased with the book 
 *Something* draws us to certain places and certain activities.   Inside our heads, no one really knows why.   In this book, Graham describes his compelling adventure in Southeast Asia, just weeks after completing high school, as he sought out a photo-journalism career.   At 18, he somehow needed to go to Vietnam when it was all but closed to Americans. The power of his mind got him there against all odds.   When he needs to leave Vietnam, will the power of his mind be enough to get him out of the prison he landed in for being American?  A thrilling read, with action, intrigue, drama, emotion, and insights into the power of his mind and yours....you will stay on the edge of your seat until the last page 
 This is the second edition of one of the finest summations of ancient Egyptian civilization ever written for the general reader. Not only is this an exellent introduction to many aspects of Egypt, it is a visual delight. The maps, especially, configure in the reader's mind spacial relationships and their cultural implications. Other illustrations of temple precincts and related architectural elements of Egyptian life supplement the excellent writing, written for, but never "down to" non-specialists. If I were to own only one reference work on ancient Egypt, this would be the one 
 was reading these short stories as they were published in Boy's Life.  The collection was almost an anti-climax - still wonderful, but by then so thorougly digested I'd practically memorized them.  The real treat was when I bought these books for my son.  Not only was there "The Mad Scientists Club" and "The New Adventures" thereof, but two full length novels published after the author's death - The Big Kerplop, and The Big Chunk of Ice.    All four are treasures 
 As a Program Manager on goverment contracts, being audited for many different areas is a way of life and always painful. Most times these audits take up a lot of time and if we are lucky we get a pass. Needles to say, any credible tool I can get my hands on to help us through gets my attention. Lord knows I don't have the time to get certified and become an expert to get me through an audit. I need something easy to read, uderstand and not filled with fluff.

 The lasting appeal of Pride and Prejudice is worth explaining to those who haven't read the book or seen the movies before launching into a review of this British classic.  First, there may be no finer book at exploring the topic of how appearances can be deceiving.  Those who are physically attractive, employ pleasant manners and flatter us will earn our approval and cause us to feel affectionate towards them.  Those who are less attractive to regard, keep to themselves and say insulting things will become people we will think poorly of.  To see how misleading those reactions can be in assessing character, compare Abraham Lincoln to Jefferson Davis, the head of the Confederacy.  Lincoln was dour, ugly and awkward with people.  Jefferson Davis was just the opposite.  When it came to character, Lincoln had enough to hold the Union together and is now viewed as one of our greatest presidents.  Most people don't remember Jefferson Davis unless reminded.    Second, at another level Pride and Prejudice is a delightful romantic comedy that looks at how love develops through a series of painful mischances.  Although not as light and funny as Shakespeare's comedies are (A Midsummer Night's Dream comes to mind), Pride and Prejudice will certainly bring a smile to most readers' faces in this regard.  Third, Elizabeth Bennet is one of the best heroines ever imagined.  Most readers will identify with her and be rooting for her to succeed.  You'll almost feel like you've developed a good friend from reading this book.  Fourth, Jane Austen is very good at poking fun at the pretensions of those who are self-absorbed or fascinated with social position and money.  But it's a loving kind of fun.  She realizes that these people are just silly . . . and don't know any better.  We can enjoy a good laugh at their expense, but we should still love and support them.  It's a good model for dealing with any goofy relatives we have.    Fifth, Pride and Prejudice is a benchmark at how far women have come from the days when they often couldn't even inherit property from their fathers.  You'll be as outraged as Mrs. Bennet is at these anachronisms . . . but you'll be assuaged to know that the worst of those bad old days are behind us.    So, if those reasons to read Pride and Prejudice appeal to you, read on as I briefly describe the story.  The Bennets have a challenge:  They have five unmarried daughters who cannot inherit Mr. Bennet's entailed estate.  With few prospects in the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is always on the hunt.  Mr. Bennet views Mrs. Bennet's fascination with this challenge as being something he would like to distance himself from.    When an eligible young man moves into the area, Mrs. Bennet's instincts are engaged to the fullest.  One of her daughters must marry Mr. Bingley.  At the next ball, the pickings seem to improve when Mr. Bingley arrives with a friend, Mr. Darcy.  Darcy  "soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report . . . of his having ten thousand a year."  But Mr. Darcy soon turned the fortune hunters off by only dancing with his sisters and refusing to be introduced to any of the other ladies.   Bingley finds himself very attracted to Jane Bennet and their relationship develops nicely . . . until he leaves suddenly for London with no plans to return.  Jane waits for some news from him or his sisters and finds herself being cut off.    In the middle of this, Mr. Collins arrives.  Collins will inherit Mr. Bennet's property upon his death.  He has just received a position as a clergyman from a powerful and opinionated sponsor, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and she has told him to get married.  With four unmarried cousins, Collins decides the Bennet daughters are his best bet.  In this way, he can provide a home for them and their mother after he inherits.  First being inspired by Jane, he redirects his attention to Elizabeth after perceiving Jane's interest in Bingley and quickly proposes.  Elizabeth will have none of it, and Collins soon finds a more enthusiastic prospect in another local family.   The younger sisters are finding themselves more than entertained by the dashing officers in a local regiment.  Through this connection, Elizabeth becomes acquainted with Wickham who confides in her that Mr. Darcy had treated Wickham with great unfairness after Mr. Darcy's father's death.  That's just one more nail in the coffin for the case against Mr. Darcy.  But in the background, we get hints that something is shifting.  Mr. Darcy goes from finding Elizabeth to be ordinary in appearance to commenting favorably about one small aspect of her face, her mouth.  But put the two of them together, and civil words do not follow.  They are like oil and water.    Jane and Elizabeth eventually make it to London where both hope that Jane will reconnect with Bingley.  But no such luck.  Just when things seem to be headed in a most bleak direction, a terrible event occurs that shakes everyone like an enormous earthquake.  In its aftermath, each character finds herself or himself needed to re-examine their position and perceptions of one another.  Will Jane and Bingley connect with one another again?  Will Elizabeth find happiness?  Will Mrs. Bennet marry her daughters off?  You'll just have to read the book to find out.  But unlike modern novelists, remember that Jane Austen wasn't against happy endings.  Enjoy a great read! 
 The remixes are pretty good, enjoyable. Some of them are rather long one of them in 9 min!!! But I really enjoyed the remix with Lil Bow Wow, even though he didn't sing at all, all he said was "Hand clap. 
 This book delivers! It tells you all you need to know about how to get a woman from a woman's point of view. It's written clearly and logically with good pointers that are really useful. I found it extremely helpful because she writes about all the stuff that guys just don't think about, but which is really important to women. If you're looking for a book on women, this is definitely the one 
 I am glad i decided to buy her book after watching her on VegTv. She has simple fast recipes but also has some harder, must know some basice cooking. I am so excited that she has homemade pasta in there. I haven't made that since i went vegan. The artichoke ravillo was to die for. And it didn't take a long time, but if you don't know what you are doing it can get messy. And as an aspiring athlete, I love the fact that all the nutritional information is there, plus the nutritional information to the "original" or meat and diary recipes. Makes it real easy to but calories, fat, protien, and carbs in my food journal. Not only that, but the recipes are GREAT. The only thing is that i am not a nutritional yeast fan. So if you aren't either ... substitute vegan parmesan. It is more exspensive, but i think it's worth it! There is almost any recipe you can think of in this book! Also in the front are good tofu tips, like freezing it and how to prepare. Information on all ingredients and where to find them. I could go on & on 
 This book is discussing pre-Islamic era of Iran. This book is discussing founder of Iran Zamin Cyrus the Great who found daynasty of Hakhamanishian. This dynasty came to an end by invasion of Alexandra. 
 I enjoyed reading this book.  In it, the authors explain what happened at the 1787 Constitutional Convention.  Most enthusiasts of the period know about Madison and Hamilton and that the Convention was convened to write a new Constitution, but what many don't know is that there were many characters besides Madison and Hamilton that attended and held sway.  And in bringing to light these other characters the book shines.    There are individual chapters on Charles Pinckney, Roger Sherman, William Paterson, Luther Martin, James Wilson, Elbridge Gerry, George Mason, and more.  The chapters are written in a lively manner without getting bogged down in details.  Collier and Collier give you the "flavor" and most important aspects of each of these characters.  There was a lot of "juice".  The reading never got dull.    There were also many issues that I was totally unaware of, such as the alliance of several southern states with the "big" states, as well as Connecticut's frequent alliance with the southern states.  I was surprised that the issue of slavery, 80 years before the Civil War, played such a central role at the Convention.  I enjoyed learning how each of the colonies fared during the period of the Articles of Confederation and how this affected their bargaining positions.  It was fascinating to learn about the process itself, the vote counting among the representatives, and the pure politics that went on during the Convention.     All in all, the book was a very quick, informative, and entertaining read.  It also fills a gap, as there is not much in the "popular" press written about the Convention.  The book is appropriate for those who have already done some reading on early American history as well as those who take a passing interest 
  The magnetic charisma of Steve Ray Vaughan literally transformed the Blues world and renovated with untamed spirits the Rock& Roll. If you go to the origin of the things you must consequently, be original.   There are many circumstances that surrounded the enormous aura of this sensational and legendary musician. His way to play the instrument, his special tune, his timeless voice but besides, the huge feeling that nestled beneath every single song, conferred him the legend status even earlier his premature death.   His wildness at the stage, the outburst of energy and histamine he left in every recital or recording session is more than evident.   With the early departure of  Steve Ray Vaughan, another awful cycle ends. Who will be able to interpret Texas flood like he did?. It's was absolute classic since its first release. He not played the guitar as the Goddess; he played with the guitar and like Orpheus brought it to life, making it cry or laugh. If you listen carefully his version of Little wing, you will realize this is far from being a simple emotional statement.   With this non sense loss, the Rock and Blues acquired new spirits; but the forthcoming generations of guitarists and listeners will never forget him.   In this sense, the acquisition of this album is not a historical reference, but a true must-have, due every time you listen him you will know why.    Perhaps, one of the most sincere and invaluable testimonials ever made, came from these sensitive words of John Lee Hooker: "I was a great fan of his, and he was a great fan of mine." Not just for the music, but for the love of each other. He was one of the greatest musicians who ever lived, and it was a great loss to the world, to blues, and to me."   The genius don't die, simply vanish.   In memoriam.              
      Montana 1948 is a really interesting 175 page book to read. It was written by Larry Watson. It is about a boy named David, his mom, and his dad, who just won his second term as sheriff of Mercer County, Montana, and his other relatives. They lived in Bentrock, with was also the county seat of Mercer County. But in during 1948, incidents and plots happen that affect the family.        These incidents involve assault, racism, and sexual harassment. There is also a lot of adventure in this book.        This book is also kind of sad because David learns awful news about his family. His favorite uncle, Uncle Frank, who was a doctor in the war, was accused of raping his Native American patients.        Larry Watson must've put a lot of thought in this book because every event in it can really happen and has happened.        If you want to know more, I strongly suggest that you read the book. You might like it. There's swearing, usage of beer, and guns, and other exiting things that might make you laugh. 
 Cooking for those with multiple food sensitivities is difficult, especially since food sensitivity tends to run in families. Over 11 million Americans have sensitivities to more than one food, so Carol Fenster, founder of savory Palate, a resource for those with food allergies and special food needs, has developed dishes which omit four of the most common allergens. There's no diary, eggs, gluten or sugar in these dishes, yet breakfast cereal, homemade pizza, and granola bars are among the many dishes which can be produced without them. No color photos, but the easy recipes don't need them.  Diane C. Donovan California Bookwatc 
 The Lotus Sutra, or Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma  (J., Myohorengekyo, Hokkekyo), the preeminent scripture in the Mahayana Buddhism of East Asia -- China, Tibet, Mongolia, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam -- is known primarily through the translation into Chinese of the Sanskrit Saddharma-pundarika-sutra by Kumarajiva in CE 406. (This 28-chapter version differs in organization and presentation from the 27-chapter Sanskrit text translated into English by H. Kern in 1884, and still available for sale; the two versions should not be confused.)   Although Kumarajiva's Lotus Sutra has influenced all of Japanese Buddhism in one way or another, it is the basic scripture for the great medieval Tendai (C., T'ien T'ai) sect, as well as the later Nichiren sect and its offshoots, especially Soka Gakkai and Rissho Koseikai, all three of which emphasize recitation of the "Nam' myohorengekyo" formula."  The Lotus is NOT included in the scriptural canon of Southern Buddhism (Theravada) in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, and other areas of SE Asia.  The Lotus Sutra is basically a statement of philosophical principles and should not be approached as literary entertainment.  Its message has serious implications - today probably more so than any time in past history.  But the reading takes patience and serious, quiet rumination.  Its message is that all sentient beings have the potential for attaining Buddhahood, but conceptual illusion prevents them from realizing that this is their essential nature.  Out of compassion, the Buddha(s) employs many devices (Skillful Means/Expedients; hoben) accommodated to their specific needs, to assist them in seeing through this illusion. (The notion is expressed through most of the sutra's Seven Parables.)  Although provisional teachings are not only possible but necessary, there is, in fact, only One Vehicle, one ultimate, ineffable spiritual goal; and for this reason the Lotus is sometimes called the Sutra of the One Vehicle. It is important to note, however, that the term does not describe an EXCLUSIVE DOGMATIC FORMULATION that is taken to be correct while others are false.  The ultimate religious experience is beyond the reach of rational understanding, which is, at best, "a finger pointing at the moon".   Although the Lotus Sutra might be viewed as the BEST possible expression of the Buddha's teaching, it is NOT THE ONE AND ONLY way to spiritual realization: other scriptures (and other words, rituals, myths, metaphors, etc.) can be embraced as expressing a more or less adequate means for attaining spiritual understanding - the specific words or symbols do no matter. The One Vehicle refers to a single experiential GOAL to be reached through a variety of conceptual formulations and exercises, but ultimately transcending the word-games of rationality. Note, however, that although the Lotus Sutra freely admits many routes to enlightenment (because of the varying needs of individuals), it does NOT claim that "one view is just as good as any another," i.e., relativism.  Although today the most popular translation of the (Chinese) Lotus Sutra may be Burton Watson's elegant rendition (1993) into English, some serious scholars still prefer this older version by Leon Hurvitz (1976); and even, occasionally, the Bunno Kato collection of three sutras (1975). Depending on the size of your wallet, you might consider buying all 3.  
 I've been a fan of Aerosmith for about 20 years.  This collection is a great way to be introduced to the band, and also a great collection for the hard-core fan 
 This is one of the most inspiring books I have ever read.  Hochschild tells an important story very powerfully and with great feeling and humanity.  And he has some facinating heroes and villains, because this is a tale of human beings at our very best and at our very worst.  Hochschild shows us the developing moral insight of abolitionist leaders like Thomas Clarkson, Granville Sharpe and the Quakers, who somehow understood something early on that was unclear to many Britons: that slavery was evil.  He also limns the amazing life of Olaudah Equiano, who knew slavery from personal experience, and shows how a small group was able to move millions of people its cause--and even get hundreds of thousands to give up sugar in their tea.  Also--and very importantly--Hochschild shows how eventual emancipation was not a gift from European and American humanitarians, but at least partially the result of a long struggle in the slave colonies by the slaves themselves, generations of whom proved willing, again and again, to die for their freedom.  It is interesting that the slave revolts in the West Indies were often a setback in public opinion for the British abolitionists: apparently it was easier to accept the idea that slavery was evil than it was to get to the idea that slaves have an inherent right of armed resistance.  Meticulous and detailed research and a passionate yet thoughtful writing style are great strengths of this book.  Hard to put down, and hard to stop thinking about even months after finishing it 
 This book gives a delightfully profound look at the need for simplicity in life.  It forces us to look at the way we live, use our time, and relate to others.  Foster searches many of the great spiritual leaders from Pascal to Kempis to provide documentation and perspective on the spiritual life.  His writings help to rediscover prayer, meditation, and the "Divine Center"  necessary for walking daily with Christ...  This is a book to read and re-read.  It is one gift that any Christian would find liberating and inspirin 
 This is a GREAT book. I loved the Little House series and I love this one. It is dfinately NOT boring and gives Rose's perspective on life 
 This book is something that my kids still enjoy, even with no more babies on the way. It really helped explain a pregnancy, without being too graphic or boring. I loved reading this book to my son and pointing out how big his sister was, compared to the pictures at different stages of pregnancy. The book also does an excellent job acknowledging what the child is experiencing, from going through baby clothes he once wore to grandma pulling out the pictures of him growing up.   I purchased several books during my 2nd pregnancy dealing with this subject and it's the only one worth reading over and over. Definitely a must have book if you have a baby sibling on the way 
 This chilling book is the real-life Oliver Twist exposed.I think Fredrick Engels wrote this book,in part to clear his conscious.And largely, to shed light on the fetid ,wretched underbelly of the 19th century industrial-age society.The nameless toilers working ten to twelve hour shifts,in a factory operation they had no vote or control over.Marx and Engels had many valid arguments for improving the workers lives.Did their end-results justify their means of social revolution? Engels would be amazed at the former textile towns,like Manchester,absorbing the large influx of Asians,Moslims and Africans today.It is still being debated,whether history has proven Engels & Marx right.This book is still a historical classic,thats presumptive findings give the modern reader,reason to pause. So,look all around you. -A Great Book !    
 Many lessons here on how history is repeated.again and again..ie the USA's attempt at its own brand of control in the middle east 
 Every story in this collection is fascinating.  Each one is its own little world.  It's easy to see why filmmakers like his stories - his dialogue is believable, and there is  always action of some sort.  The Variable Man, the longest  short story in this collection, is an action-adventure film  waiting to happen.  The King of the Elves is one of my many  favorites 
 I recently purchased this book, again, for my grandchildren.  My daughters and nephew still remember this book.  They loved it and we read it many, many times together.  It is the perfect age level for my 7 yr. old grandson, but a little long for the 4 year old.  We usually just "talk the book" because he loves the illustrations. I am an artist myself and I just love the artwork.  After the first reading of the book, it transferred over to the dinner table.  What would happen if we had a flood of green beans?  A funny, silly and wonderful book 
 That Nemirovsky died in Auschwitz before she could finish this novel is yet another shame to lay at the feet of the Nazis, but the books that survive are wonderful:  stories told with grace, elegance, tenderness, and a wry humor for human foibles.  This is imperative war fiction, highly recommended for readers who loved Anita Shreve's RESISTANCE and Jenna Blum's THOSE WHO SAVE US 
 Successful blogger Robert Scoble and co-author Shel Israel push people in business to get involved with blogging as a means of communication and of staying on top of conversations that affect their companies. The authors summarize blogging's history and provide examples of how companies have benefited from it, including interviews with high-ranking corporate bloggers. Their easy-to-read and easy-to-understand writing style ensures that even those who know little about blogging can grasp it. The book covers how to blog and how to participate in conversations, rather than always talking and never listening. We recommend it to businesspeople who blog or are thinking about it, and to executives who want to know why blogging is important and how it can build their companies' bottom line 
 I was given this book by my bishop and I'm glad I read it. Today, Monterey California's Cannery Row, where Steinbeck told of poor folk and sardine canning, has been developed into a world of quaint shops, high prices, and quizzical tourists.Doc's Western Biological Company, where he collected lab animals for science, has morphed into The Monterey Bay Aquarium, one of the worlds great aquariums and conservation organizations. (A very favorite place of mine.) The freewheeling life Steinbeck depicts at the Palace Flophouse is today thought of more sordidly as "homelessness." Too bad. Poor folk have stories and grace; indeed, their stories are deep and diverse. The grace of the lives within this book is abundant, the sense of life as scaps in a quilt, not "lifestyle." This is a book about men. Women who are not whores with hearts of gold are domesticators and nags. Its central image is the tidepool, battered, changeable, and full of life and hidden tragedy. Its scene stealer is a spoiled pointer puppy named Darling 
 The way the author explains money makes cents! Really. It's simple, and most people should be able to follow his instructions and get out of debt. It will require sacrifice and diligence, but without these you won't get anywhere anyways 
 Eric Sundquist's book is an invaluable resource for information when trying to understand the background of Invisible Man.  This is the place to start if you're doing research on the novel.  Not only does Sundquist present the prolific sources that Ellison used and referenced through the novel, the editor also provides additional resource materials for each reference.  It's wonderful if you're writing a research paper, and helpful for the curious reader who wants to be even further convinced of Ellison's genius 
 This is a short book, but the author manages to cram lots of information and exposition into a small package.  This is really a journal of a middle-aged man's attempt to restore a classic motorcycle, and the  friendships and hardships the restoration engenders.  Being a motorcycle  enthusiast and owner of at least 25 bikes over the last 30 years, I liked  the technical details and the wheeling and dealing involved in restoring an  old machine in Montana. As an avid reader, I liked the flow and the  atmosphere the author generated 
 [...]  1.	Every year, Susie Bright attempts to orchestrate an ensemble of stories that represent every taste, or almost every taste, but that's an impossible feat, as demonstrated by reviews of pervious collections. Another thing to note is Susie solicits nominations for each year's collection, so I hope reader/reviewers at Amazon will nominate selections for upcoming editions of BAE.   2.	 The job of a writer is to entertain readers while holding a mirror to the society he or she lives in-which can make a lot of people uncomfortable. Writers of erotica or writers whose work appears in erotica collections are no exception-or shouldn't be. Erotica is fluid and multi-dimensional, like all literature, and the writers whose work appear in Best American Erotica 2006 offer the complexity of our human condition, sexuality included. BRAVO!  While every single story in this book is good, I have my favorites: "Mille," "Under the House," "Full House," "Drunkie's Surprise," "Ukiyo," "The Clay Man," and "The Nasty Kind Always Are."   The last mentioned, written by Steve Almond, dick-lit maestro that he is, made me gasp at the end. Almond created a story that manages to be social satire while also being downright sexy-and in this case, shocking. I was taken aback.    Sera Gamble's "The Clay Man" is now one of my favorite short stories in the world. I first heard about The Golem watching X-Files. He came up again in graduate school. I intend to read Gamble's story again and again to figure out how it works so well. Let me just say the premise is clever, the protagonist is intriguing, the relationship between the two sisters is complex, and the writing is really-really good. The overall implications of the story venture into deep, uncomfortable terrain.    "Ukiyo," by Donna George Storey, is another well written story that is lush with eroticism and Japanese culture. What I loved best about this story was its ability to take me somewhere I'd never been and experience customs I knew nothing about-all through a writing professor protagonist.   I'm not sure where Susie Bright found Kweli Walker, but I'm grateful she did. Who knew "gumming" a man could make for such a fun and sexy read. The voice in Kweli's story is bawdy and bold, and I loved the mentoring relationship that takes place between the protagonist and the stripper. Excellent stuff!  "Full House is another terrific read by a terrific writer. David Sedaris is always marvelous.   "Under the House" is another story that takes readers to dark and disturbing terrain. Its subject matter pushes the envelope and blurs the line between right and wrong, taboo/socially acceptable, and I dig ambiguity like this. The writing, again, is terrific. Actually "Under the House" is an excerpt from a novel, The Curse of the Inappropriate Man, by the writer, Lynn Freed, which I plan to get sooner than later.   Last but not least, "Mille" is another novel excerpt from Helen Walsh's, Brass, and the excerpt reads as beautifully as a prose poem. I finished reading it then went back and read it again right away.   In fact, I've no doubt I'll read several of the stories in Best American Erotica 2006 again, not only for the sheer enjoyment but to learn something as well.  Peace.       
 This was my second Blackie Ryan book and I found that I enjoyed it far more than the first which was The Bishop and the missing L Train. This one kept me on the each of seat and page turning, trying to guess what had happened, along with all the other enjoyable characters kept me going untill the final page. A first rate book and a new author to read had me doing handstands for joy 
 This truly is a must own for anybody. I bought mine from a seller.The story of two peoples lives. Husband gambles,loses everything,wife still loves him. See how their lives overcome this and suffer the ups and downs of life. It felt like the viewer became part of their lives,the sad and happy. It's truly a gripping film. Don't miss this. It's one of the best I ever saw. 10 stars!!! 
 Janet Evanovich did it again!  This is one of the Stephanie Plum novels I'm addicted to and can read over and over again.  She gets better and better as the series moves along.  
 I have several books on natural healing and feeding of our pets. I started with an adopted puppy that was not doing well on any of the better commercial brands. This book has reinforced that I am doing the right things, and sadly I could have done more for my beloveds that I had before him. I am making sure that everyone in my family has a copy, as well as our veterinarians. If my current vet isn't willing to work with me, I will find another 
 I love this book. I am trying to wean myself from meats, and all the recipes in this book look delicious! Following Ms. Jaffrey's instructions, I can easily give up meat without feeling like I'm missing a thing in my diet 
 Dr. King in this book, gives the background on the successful demonstrations in Birmingham and The  1963 March on Washington. (My father was at that march). Martin gives the insights on his Non -violent Direct Action approach and how it worked in Birmingham. He also explains what he meant in his I have a dream speech. Those who read this book will see that Dr. King favored a approach to bring African-Americans in the Mainstream that is similiar to Affirmative Action. Dr. King's mistakes were he assumed the whites in the North would favor his approach when he came to their neighborhood (Chicago 1966)and that those who favored ending segregation would support spending government money to help poor Blacks. All Americans should read this book 
 This book is a quick way to jam through some GMAT practice math questions, nothing more and nothing less.  I sat down and did it in a weekend without too much effort.  I agree with other reviews that this book is not a good place to begin your studying in that there aren't many pages devoted to concepts - it really is just a tool for practice.  As mentioned in other reviews, the questions are in order of difficulty.  I found this useful because it gives you a very clear sense of what the GMAT considers difficult versus the types of questions that are considered easy.  If you're like me, you'll zip through the bulk of the questions and then hit a wall where you notice you're getting more and more wrong - a good thing, while you're still studying!  Kaplan questions are generally harder than these, Princeton Review a bit easier, and Barron's are just plain bizarre.  Given the huge inconsistency across books - it's nice to ground yourself in "official" questions once in awhile.  
 My oldest had to have Mr Potato Head when Toy Story came out. Of course the cardboard box didn't last long & the pieces were scattered & lost but with this set the container is plastic & it is easier to keep the pieces together & hold their attention longer. It is now being played with by child # 3, so I would say it is definitely worth the money. My only complaint would be the container could be a little bigger to allow little hands to put the accessories away easier. But all in all, it is a great toy 
 A powerful book which models a view of hell from a more biblical perspective than the traditional view. The author fails to make his case on several occasions but overall this does not detract from the ultimate value of his work. A must read for those who are investigating the topic. I am presently writing a work which will supplement this authors' weaknesses. A bit wordy and unnecessarily exhaustive at points. Overall a job well done. Pastor Ke 
 If you've never read an EC story, but have always been curious, this is the best place to start (unless you have unlimited amounts of money to invest in buying up the back issues).  This archive edition is of a title that was a sampler of EC's (in)famous stories -- stories that influenced the likes of Steven Spielberg, Stephen King, George Romero, George Lucas and John Carpenter.  In this volume you've got crime, horror, social commentary (some of it very hard hitting), war and science fiction.  The stories hold up even today and show how EC helped to shape modern horror.  EC holds a special place in the history of horror, comics, and censorship.  This archive volume shows you why.  EC was unafraid of tackling subjects like racism and blind patriotism (no pun intended -- you'll get it later) and mix it up with unapologetic horror where a murdering husband ends up eating his wife, or a sci-fi tale where people are skinned and worn like fur.  Affordable and beautiful, these books deserve a place in the library of any horror and comic fan.  If you don't have this one already, get it today 
 This DVD features some of the greatest ballet pieces you will ever find in any compilation.  I can't wait to give it as a gift

 Athol Fugard, 'Master Harold' ... and the boys. New York: Penguin. 1984.  Originally produced in 1982 by the Yale Repertory Theatre.  Hally does not know who he is.  The single white character on stage in South African-born playright Athol Fugard's one-scene work is the friend of his mother's two black employees when they tend to St George's Park Tearoom in her absence.  But he is also their 'Master Harold'-reluctantly but inevitably-when the stress of his crippled, alcoholic father's homecoming impels him into an emotional space that one simply does not share with black folks.  Perhaps is it the burden of dealing with human beings on the multiple levels that racism forces upon those who resent but ultimately accede to their required roles that embitters Hally beyond redemption.  Hally doesn't know several things.  He is ignorant of the nobility with which Sam and Willie have battled for his dignity over the years of service to his family.  He doesn't understand that even this virtue has its limits, beyond which dignity weighs more than the possibility of continuing friendship.  Hally doesn't understand that a night of dancing at the Eastern Province Open Dancing Championships is a thing of beauty rather than of entertainment, nor the hope that is nurtured in a space where for one night people never bump into each other.   'Master Harold', the title upon which he insists at the cost of everything that matters, will never know because he cannot learn.  He is a million times more the victim of the 1950's racism in the land of Fugard's birth than any black man whom, when pushed beyond his modest emotional means, he shoves around.  They, at least, leave this dark, sad drama with something 
  As the liner notes say this album certainly does show Soft Machine changing. The album is well produced and nicely packaged. Disc 1 starts us off with a hazy version of As If with Phil Howard going crazy on drums instead of John Marshall.Also different from the song is the echo sax by Elton Dean and no solo by Roy Babbington. Drop sound just like it does on Fifth not that much over dubbing on it. The unreleased Welcome To Frillsville is a long jam with Howard actually keeping a beat,the end product of the song is a lovely smooth jazz theme. Then we see Karl Jenkins and John Marshall in for Dean and Howard. The Melody features a great version of MC and Drop,All White is the same as the version on Six. Stanley Stamps is played with a synth in the backgound,pretty good too. And the starting of a great tune of Hazard Profile actually has a better lead on the beginning rift instead of those one line notes on the other Profile. Disc 2 has the Baritone Guitar solo of Babbington with turns into the relaxing recorder and sax lead of Down the Road still no Acostic Bass solo by Babbington. North Point is a cross between D.I.S and Four Gongs with some messy synth. The smoothness of The Man Who Waved at Trains also has Peff with out the guitar rift at the end. Then we go to the finale Hazard Profile which has a different middle part with out the organ lines being in charge on chord changes. And part 5 is in there but Ratlegdge's solo is on organ not a analog synth. If you got $30  (rip-off) go out and buy this masterpiece.     
 I was very into the second book of the Anita Blake series. It held somewhat of a mystery all the way up until the end. It was action packed and kept me turning the pages and not wanting to put it down. For some strange reason I really like Jean-Claude. Hamilton gives very detailed descriptions of her characters. I just picked up the third.. and the series continues.. 
 One of the funniest things you'll ever watch... 
 Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo are great. Even my husband loved this move 
 This simple little story is an old one that I first heard many years ago.  The youngster in this book is saddled with several obstacles.  Child labor laws are yet to come about - her father sends her out into the world to work.  The family deals with poverty and hunger.  Improperly clothed, the little girl is sure to succomb to frostbite.  She knows that her father will surely abuse her if she comes home empty-handed.  With no way out, this youngster turns to her own rich inner life to help her transcend her impossible situation.  This is the story of the power of love - the love of her own late grandmother - that sustains her as she slips into her own death.  It is a lasting parable about looking within to find the resources that sustain us. 
 I do not agree that this is a sociology of Soviet posters, in the sense that it is a "long range" cultural analysis of their meaning. I  think that the book's highlight is exactly in drawing a connection between  changes in artistic style and "short range" political events. So,  in the early days of Soviet power- from Lenin's time down to  collectivization - one has an Expressionistic, unreal style that tries,  above all, to convince strikingly the viewer to support a given political  "lime". After Stalin's consolidation as leader, one has a  pseudo-realistic style praising the "actual" quality of living in  the USSR, in order to obtain the passive acquiescence of the viewer. Very   useful book. Can be used - with due guidance - at undergraduate level 
 As a parent that knows little of the computer world outside of email, Quicken, and the occasional Google, I fould this book enlightening. With two children just now realizing the computer is more than a gaming console, I feel I am well prepared for their future internet explorations 
 Being next to her just as she sings... simply couldn't get better than that! As a jazz freak, it is nice to settle down and just enjoy little nicely composed tunes, in all sense just a great work! Very standard preserved jazz, well structured and entertaining, and Diana's piano skills just add more and more to the scene, not to mention her consonant beautiful voice that is always precisely adding more harmonic structure overall. The girl is talented, no doubt, but I recognize other than her virtuosity the fact that she sticks to her style, and she does it like few others, Sarah Vaughan  et al... Great music, just get it.. 
 Really this gets 3.5 stars, a compromise between its shortcomings and its strengths. I round up because it's extremely readable and informative and its flaws don't detract from these qualities. Basically what we have here is a critical (but far from apologetic) look back on the Sixties student movement from someone who was on the inside. There are fairly perceptive glances here and there to other aspects of the era's counterculture and political movement but the outlook is basically limited to that of the SDS "Old Guard" (the student activists eager to proclaim radical politics since the Kennedy era, when said politics were still unfashionable).   Though this group was to be at the center of the late sixties rebellion, the title is a bit deceiving--this isn't an overview of the decade, per se but rather the decade as Todd Gitlin saw if from his perch in SDS. That's part of the problem with the book, because Gitlin veers back and forth between historical recollection/analysis and personal memories without really choosing which he wants to develop--and both suffer as a result (the memoir aspect most of all). We get only a vague idea of what his role in all of this was and throughout much of the book he seems more like an observor than an active participant. But then that seems to be true of the New Left as a whole. They were vainly (in both senses of the word) talking sense to power in the early years, unable to connect with the counterculture of mid-decade, and then dissolving into squabbling factions hedonistically pursuing revolution by '69. I for one got the sense that the SDS' power was greatly exaggerated, both by itself and by the opposition. SDS seems to have been the proverbial tail that thinks it's wagging the dog, as Gitlin comes close to pointing out a few times. His memories add to the sense that he, and the old SDSers, spent most of the decade either cheerleading or wringing their hands at the various actors on the political stage, from SNCC to the Black Panthers, the Diggers to the Yippies, the more radical students to the eventually psychotic Weather Underground, often ignoring the more mainstream peace movement to the liberal politicians who were the actual movers and shakers. Perhaps Gitlin gives himself and SDS short shrift by focusing on all the different movements and trends sweeping the 60's, but if so I would've liked to see a book recounting HIS experiences of the 60's.   Then again, maybe it's just one of those "contradictions" he speaks of late in the book. His memories, like being aided by Democratic delegates in the middle of the Chicago confrontation-or of a bunch of uptight student radicals being confronted by the charismatic revolutionary Diggers) add color to the recounted political theater of the times and ultimately, both are just as indispensible as they are problematic. Ultimately, I have to recommend this book because of its coherent analysis of different 60's factions that too often get clumped together (many times have I heard Bernardine Dohrn's Charles Manson comments held up as if they were representative of the entire student Left). Be aware that the book is not a comprehensive overview of those years, it very much takes the "Old Guard" (i.e., involved since the early 60's) radical student view of things, and rarely if ever questions the premise of the radical movement (hence latter-day conservatives and neocons will find much to disagree with). Nonetheless, it's quite a text--nah, screw the academic jargon, it's a good story, and it's worth your time 
 It may seem like an exageration to say that a book about advertising fundamentally changed the way I view the world... but it did (and 9 out of ten dental hygenists agree).  Anyways, this book is sensational.  It give  an interesting historical overview, and then goes on to analyze the way  advertising has shaped modern society.  I'm going to read all of Mr.  Twitchell's books.  He is a really clever and witty writer, and obviously  has some great insights on modern culture.  Plus, this book has lots of  pictures of the ads/trends he discusses-- this is a real asset to the text 
 This is one of the most interesting books I've read in awhile. It's not very long, it's a quick read and the author does a good job of providing a background to lucid dreaming and explains the benefits that are associated with lucid dreaming, as well as providing a guide to becoming lucid in your dreams. The book comes with a CD to help you become lucid in your dreams and the CD contains several exercises that are all narrated by the author. The exercises on the CD are easy to follow and the quality of the recording is very good. Some tracks also contain meditative music in the background. There are some topics in relation to lucid dreaming that were not covered in the book that I would have liked to see the author comment on, such as the variety of available legal herbal supplements that are supposed to promote the occurrence of lucid dreams. Although I cannot say that the book has helped me become lucid in my own dreams as of yet, the author's techniques that are taught in the book and on the accompanying CD  have already helped me go from not remembering any of my dreams to being able to recall several dreams per night with increasingly more detail.

 This is the first Primal Scream album I've ever listened to and i've never heard anything like them before.  They are a very unique band .... this album is excellent.  My impression is that they combine techno and rock into one.  I am not a techno fan by any means, but they make techno into something that I can like.  For those who hate techno, don't fret, this album leans more towards rock than anything 
 Got to say this may have been the best one of the 3 Sleepaway Camps. It follows the same basic plot as the first 2 films. A bunch of young campers end up dead through creative ways. I am amazed at how creative Angela (Pam Springstein) is in killing off the fornicating youth. I was really getting to admire Angela's determination at killing off those who spite her or clash with her values.   All in all Sleepaway Camp III is suprisingly a good end to a decade old slasherflick and the ending leaves the door open for a 4th movie, although Sleepaway Camp IV (2002) was canceled after 2 weeks of shooting.   If they ever decide to make another Sleepaway Camp, Pam Springstein has to play Angela, she makes the film, maybe this time they will use her brother for the soundtrack.. 
 despite its controversial past, i've subscribed for years and enjoy this magazine a lot.  definately a lot of good articles 
 I don't know if I read this exact edition since there are other translations. I read the one with the cliff on the front of it. So, poke around and find that edition. I think it was the Penquin classic. In any case, here are a few reasons why you should by and read this book: It's got everyting in it, imprisionment, big crazy love, nasty people and thrills a go-go. Never mind the fact that the book is very thick and makes you look smart.  It's basically a soap opera with  a French accent. Like the whole General Hospital Luke and Laura except slightly diffferent. This is a big story and you will find it hard to put it down once you get all the pieces in motion.  So, read it. If you hate it, throw the book at someone you dislike. You're sure to do some damage 
 Valian is a cognitive psychologist.  I saw her speak at a local university and was impressed by the breadth of evidence she presented re: how ingrained gender discrimination is in the thinking of both men and women, but also with her logical suggestions for addressing this problem.  (She, as a matter of fact, was invited by women students and faculty to help them strategize how to get more women into higher positions.)  In her convincing talk, I was struck by the evidence that discrimination is not something "done" by men to keep women down, but is, in fact, "done" equally to women by both men and women.   So I got her book and was more impressed when I read it.  Valian presents experiment after experiment showing that women are held back by psychologically ingrained ideas held by both men AND women.  She calls these gender schemas, which are a way for the brain to organize complex information.  (They are close to stereotypes, but schema is a more neutral term).  The evidence is fascinating and convincing.  Examples: if a man and a woman of identical height stand in an identical height door frame, viewed separately and then rated, both men and women perceive the man to be taller.  Or how a woman can make a suggestion during a meeting and no one hears it, but later a man makes the exact same suggestion and everyone hears it and thinks it's great.  (Example after example you will all recognize and be disgusted by!)  While the knowledge presented in this book is depressing, Valian ends with suggestions for ways to become aware of these fallacies in thinking and then actively counteract them within organizations.  I LOVE this book and it is a true eye-opener.  It has really opened my eyes to what women have to surmount to get ahead when there are so many hidden negative assumptions ingrained in our culture.  While it is written in an academic style and perhaps less accessible than a pop-psychology type or journalist-written book, one could read the introduction and conclusions to the chapters and skim parts of the in between text if it gets too heavy.  (Like all academic writers she says her main points in the chapter intro, then presents evidence, then summarizes at the end of the chapters.)  I highly recommend this book!    
 Very well-written, very informative, balanced view of the evolution and struggles that Israel has undergone.   I only wish it had an extra chapter to give similar perspective to the tumult of the past few years 
 Bought on vinyl when it first came out.  Truly a Stones fan at heart 
 My 11 year old saw this movie at school and wouldn't stop talking about it or asking for it. Since we couldn't find it at any store we amazoned it and there it was!!. Part of his Christmas present, he loves it. This movie is very inspiring and from what he says it makes him have hope in other people and what we can do to help others 
 This was a great idea book.  Get this book before your baby even arrives to help give you pointers on what to take pictures of and things to keep for your scrapbook.  Plus, it helps pass the time by!  After my baby was born I still had "fetal-brain-drain" and needed ideas for page layouts.  In the back there are  ideas for page titles and poems to include in your baby's book.  Well worth the money..... 
 This is one of those books that the more you look at the pictures, the more you see.  The illustrations are both beautiful and whimsical.  I also really like how many of the images are repeated throughout the book.  The book is sturdy and pages are easy to turn.  I've given this and its companion by Alison Jay, "ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book," to many new parents with rave reviews 
 The myth of slavery derives from the powerful images of the miniseries Roots; the notion that black people were simply swept out of their African lives, degraded and sometimes killed on  the harsh way to America and then put to work on a cotton plantation without power of any sort.  Ira Berlin, in this beautifully written and thoroughly researched history of the first two hundred years of American slavery, "Many Thousands Gone",  blows apart that myth.  He says that slavery had great variety, based on geographic, economic and generational factors. The first generation of slaves in America were creoles, born of white and African American parents.  They frequently lived along the sea and interacted with people of all walks of life, were traders and often spoke multiple languages.  These slaves frequently stayed with their families, knew and utilized the courts to petition for freedom, they worked with their slave-owners to grow crops and to negotiate payment for their eventual freedom.   This changed with subsequent generations who were plucked from central Africa and did not have the same experience with the white world.  While slaves in these subsequent generations lost the power to negotiate the terms of their slavery with their slaveholders, they were able to grab autonomy in other ways.  They grew and sold goods in cities, they purchased their freedom, though often at a high price.  They escaped and formed maroon armed communities.  A few other factors also played a significant role in determining the virulence of slavery, specifically geography and economics.   Some crops like cotton and tobacco were  well suited to the plantation systems and in areas where those crops grew well, the slave system was particularly harsh.  History was another factor. In the form of the American Revolution it disrupted the plantation system, because the plantation owners, who were often patriots with strong beliefs in the rights of man, also owned slaves and defended their right to do so.  The loyalists took advantage of this dilemma and often had the plantation slaves fighting on the loyalist side in exchange for the promise of becoming free men.  Sometimes they even delivered on that promise.   My only criticism is that I wanted more of a narrative that would bring together the various aspects of slavery.  I was left with the feeling that American slavery was really Mississippi slavery or South Carolina slavery or New York slavery.   The legacy of slavery appears to be monolithic even if the experience of slavery was not.  
 I have to admit that I was shocked to read all the negative reviews on this stroller.  I have loved it from the day my daughter was born, almost 2 years ago, and am now using it with my son.  It's very lightweight and easy to steer.  I never have a problem maneuvering it through the mall or in stores, even in the tightest of spaces.  My daughter loves that she can sit forward and see the world around her, and I love that she can be buckled into a 5 point harness at the same time!!!  After 2 years of pretty constant use and being tossed into and pulled out of my car trunk and my husband's truck, the stroller still looks brand new.  The fabric is easy to clean and very durable.  I can understand the remarks about the cup holder and basket being on the small side.  If these particular features are on your "most important" list, I might think about buying a full-sized stroller or travel system, not one of the Italian brands.  Europeans just don't understand our fascination with gallon-sized cup holders and enormous storage baskets...just look at their cars and you'll understand.  However, if you're looking for a stroller that can function well both as your everyday standard stroller and as your travel lightweight stroller, go with the Aria.  
 Blackburn takes a different approach to introducing philosophy:  rather than provide a chronological survey (a la Will Durant) or a cartoon-&-sidebar summary (a la the Dummies and Idiot books), he focuses on eight of the most important philosophical problems and invites the reader to work through them, with the author's help and guidance from some of the leading thinkers in the Western tradition.  He is by and large successful in this effort, pitching his discussion to the "intelligent" beginner.  By the end of the book, you have both observed philosophers at work and taken a crack at philosophy yourself 
 You do not have to work in the nonprofit world to appreciate the management lessons in this book. It is a thoughtful, analytical book that also takes care to make itself an accessible and enjoyable read. People who run small businesses should read this book to rejuvinate their businesses and bring them into the 21st Century 
 Can't stop listening to "I Fall to Pieces"! 
 I found this book to be very helpful in understanding Kant's aesthetics.  Kant's philosophy is notoriously difficult - so it is nice to have access to books such as this one, that interpret Kant's writing in a non-technical way for a contemporary audience.  The book analyzes the overall argument of the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment (the first part of the Critique of Judgment) in a clear, conversational, and questioning style that is appropriate for beginners and more advanced readers of Kant.  The author skillfully uses possible objections and apparent ambiguities in Kant's text as a way of delving more deeply into the substance of what Kant is saying.  The author states in the preface that the book does not presuppose prior knowledge of Kant's writings, and I found this to be true on the whole.  The book does indeed point out many connections between Kant's aesthetics and the epistemology of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.  There is extensive discussion of the four "moments" of the judgment of taste, as well as sections on genius, the sublime, the connection between morality and the beautiful, and the question of whether there can be genius in mathematics.  Several extra features make this book stand out from other introductory works on Kant.  First, technical terms are highlighted in bold in the text and defined in the extensive glossary at the end of the book.  Second, at the end of each chapter subsection there is an annotated list of some of the secondary literature that addresses that particular topic.  Third, at the end of the book there is a summary and overview of the main points of the book 
 So begins the introduction to this singular and essential book about the Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi. Long associated with the Japanese tea ceremony, only few writers have tried to give a perspective on this complex term that describes the sensibility for many aesthetic decisions made in the design and selection of materials for the tea ceremony - ranging from tea utensils, to flower arrangements, to the mood and spatial qualities of tea huts and the gardens that contain them.  Leonard Koren engages us with his views as an artist informed by many years of living with and observing all things Japanese. The book itself is an illustration of the wabi-sabi aesthetic: the careful choice of the paper, the binding, the type-setting and photographs throughout the text convey the essence of what the author is writing about.  For those that have a sense of the unique beauty and quality of the Japanese crafts, architecture and gardens, but have never been able to quite put their finger on the underlying aesthetic, this book creates a context for understanding and further discovery 
 i command you again to get this album NOW!!!!!! 
 This record is a true jewel, a century-recording. It's like you enter a place with stagnant energy in which, suddenly, a beautiful woman who dropped from nowhere lights a cigarette, and not voluntarily, but because you let yourself go, you inhale the smoke, and thereby inhale the woman's perfume and all her being ...  It has the incredible presence of touch, of life, of emotions that only analog recordings have and the digital era has buried in 'clean' sound anaestetics. The talent of the musicians is nothing less than genius, not to talk about Jobim's music which is not of century, but of millennary genius. The inner harmony and synergy between Jobim and Regina is not to put in words. It's one of those rare encounters between artists that are truly blessed by heaven.   This unique music has transformed me an evening of utter depression into one of wonder and inner peace. This music is truly religious, in a non-religious sense.   What Brazilians teach us is that musical genius, when you encounter it incarnated in a human being seems to be simplicity. This simplicity is the outer shell of high inner complexity. Brazilians are all gifted for music, as they have it in their blood. This is because they are one of the most emotionally intelligent cultures on earth, together with Cubans and Italians.  One last word: there is today lots of Samba and Bossa Nova around. Don't let yourself fool by all these copy productions. This CD has the originals!! And you may be surprised at the romantic slowness of some of the pieces that you heard played like clockworks and with digital robotic perfection. And also you may be surprised about the natural pathos of the Brazilian soul. What most people confuse with 'bar music' truly is a religious expression. It's people presenting themselves without a shell, without an emotional armor, and with a totally open heart. And the Brazilian language, that has almost totally transcendented Portuguese is next to Indonesian and Italian one of the most beautiful languages for chant.  To play this music like nightclub candies, which is (unfortunately) the understanding most Westerners have of Brazilian music, is based on a cultural misunderstanding. For Brazilians their music is sacred, no less than that. And perhaps, this CD will convince you of this truth!  This CD merits 50 stars, not just 5 
 This disc contains some incredible choral works, performed by one of the nation's best collegiate choirs. The music is brilliantly written and well performed, and based on those qualities alone I would easily give this CD a five-star rating.   Unfortunately, the sound quality is not up to the standards I expect from a commercial disc. The music, like most choral compositions, contains a very wide dynamic range, and there is discernable audio clipping during the loud passages on nearly every track.   Don't get me wrong, this is a truly enjoyable disc, and a must-have for any Whitacre fan, especially since there is no other recording of the complete a cappella works available. However, the poor mastering reduces my enjoyment of this recording from a five to a four 
 This is the perfect book to read if you are interested in raising rabbits.  Everything you need to know is in this book.  If you are interested in raising rabbits for meat, this is a great book 
 If you're looking for a collection of just the hits, stick with 2003's SOUNDS OF SUMMER. If you need a nostalgia fix for the Beach Boys' best albums of the Sixties through the mid-Seventies, pick up the two-fers of their classic albums from SURFIN' SAFARI through SURF'S UP. However, if you want a solid overview of America's most influential band and why Brian Wilson is regarded as a genius, wrap your ears around this 5-disc GOOD VIBRATIONS box set. Brian Wilson and company take you on a  magical history tour from their debut single "Surfin'" to their final No. 1, "Kokomo." ESSENTIA 
 I bought this DVD, because I had a vague recollection that I had loved this television series as a child. I also have always had a great liking for the actor Leo G. Carroll. Moreover, the price of the DVD seemed to be a bargain.   Based upon the characters created by Thorne Smith in his best selling book of the same name, this television series followed on the heels of the success of the Topper films that were made for the silver screen. The television series was also a hit and ran for several years during the nineteen fifties. I am not surprised at its success, given the quality of some of the writing. A number of the episodes were written by Stephen Sondheim, who later went on to greater fame and fortune. Mr. Sondheim's involvement in the television series was something of which I was unaware, until I received the DVD.   The thrust of the story is that the dapper and elegant Cosmo Topper (Leo G. Carroll) is vice-president of a bank. He is married to the sweet but dim Henrietta (Lee Patrick). They live in a house that they bought from the estate of an unfortunate young couple, George and Marion Kirby (Robert Sterling and Anne Jeffreys), who died in a skiing accident after being swept away by an avalanche. Their St. Bernard, Neil, who was unable to rescue them, also died with them. To Cosmo's surprise, his house is haunted by their ghosts and that of their alcohol imbibing St. Bernard. The problem is that only he can see or hear them. This allows for a lot of funny episodes, as the Kirbys tend to complicate Cosmo's life. As soon as I heard the theme song for the series, I was transported back in time.   Everyone episode on this DVD is guaranteed to bring a smile to the viewer's face. The role of Topper was perfectly cast, as Leo G. Carroll makes a delightful Topper. Lee Patrick is darling as his well-meaning, sweet and silly wife. Anne Jeffreys is terrific as the beautiful Marion Kirby, and Robert Sterling is great as her freewheeling husband. Of course, our cocktail loving St. Bernard is wonderfully portrayed by Buck. Moreover, several of the episodes include some of the original commercials, which certainly takes the viewer on a trip down memory lane and provides its own share of laughs. I only wish that some television honcho would consider a remake of this wonderful television series. 
 This is a well written epic that chronicles in great detail the American decision to go to war in S.E. Asia. One thing that strikes me is that this is a non-partisan work which is refereshing given the recent series of books (left and right)on Iraq. I have read about 20 books on the subject of Vietnam and this is by far the best 
 Eleven of my age group soccer kids completed the 30 workouts in this book in ten weeks.  After seeing the improvement in acceleration and speed, the other 8 team members and their parents are sorry they didn't join in. The 30 workouts alone are worth the price of the book. You don't need a sports science background. If you are looking for a "just do-it" approach that improves speed in short sprints, this book is for you.  The book cuts to the chase. There is no need to dig out anything. Everything that is included is important and the program works 
 I remember those days.  I used to dress up for work, the high heels and stockings and garter belts, before pantyhose.  I like this movie and always try to catch it when it's on TV.  I know I'll catch heck for saying this, but I miss those days.  During the so called "women's lib" days women were very cruel to other woman who wanted to be married and raise a family.  I used to say back to these woman "this is America, we have a choice". Of course I was shouted down so I learned to keep my opinions to myself. Whatever we've gained from "women's lib" (much, much more work, if you ask me and our children are suffering for it)doesn't make up for all we've lost 
 I'm a big fan of Melissa and the Indigo Girls and this soundtrack works for me.  I love each and every song.  Other reviews have captured the essence of the music, my review is to emphasize the staying power 
 Reading this book, while grieving for my cocker spaniel, helped me go through the tears, the emotional turmoil, the depression, and eventual glimmers of hope, that accompany the loss of a beloved pet.  I recommend it highly 
 The other day a teacher came into the library where I work and explained to me that she was doing a unit with her kids on quilting.  She already had some non-fiction titles on the subject, but what she really wanted was picture books that talked about the craft.  Immediately I thought of "Show Way" by Jacqueline Woodson, "Goha the Wise Fool", by Denys Johnson-Davies (a quilted picture book), "Oma's Quilt" by Paulette Bourgeois, "Tar Beach" by Faith Ringgold (another quilted picture book), and "Sweet Clara and the Freedom Quilt" by Deborah Hopkinson.  But even before any of these book jumped to my mind, before I'd even stopped to consider a one of them, there was a book that I thought of first.  "The Patchwork Quilt" by Valerie Flournoy is (I would dare say) the best-known quilting picture book of them all.  A winner of the Coretta Scott King Award and the very first winner of the prestigious Ezra Jack Keats Books Award, this 1985 production and Reading Rainbow Book has remained a classic well past the time when most book lie on shelves forgotten.   	 Grandma has an idea.  When she was a little girl her own mother made her a beautiful patchwork quilt.  Now Tanya, her granddaughter, is showing some interest in Grandma's quilting.  Therefore, she's going to make a quilt of her own.  A "masterpiece" is what it's going to be.  So when any family member has a special outfit made or has to get rid of a beloved set of pants, Grandma's always there, handy with the scissors.  Slowly everyone in the family gets his or herself added to the quilt, until one day Grandma gets sick.  There her quilt sits on the back of her old chair, gathering dust.  Fortunately, Tanya knows she can take charge.  Her mother agrees to do the sewing and Tanya cuts fabric.  Even her brothers get in on the act.  Soon enough Grandma is well again, the quilt is finished, and everyone is now a part of it.   	 Flournoy has written a book that has a great deal of dignity to it.  The words are not necessarily easy ones, but they come off as natural when written on the page.  Flournoy sets up emotional plot points, like Tanya's mother coming to accept why the quilt is really important.  Grandma's recovery, I should point out, isn't presented as something miraculous or out of place.  It works within the framework of the narrative.  There's really only one moment in the plot that gave me pause.  When Tanya starts working on the quilt herself, she feels that there's a piece that's definitely missing.  She ponders and ponders this until finally she realizes what that piece might be.  Grandma.  Grandma is missing from the quilt.  So while Grandma is asleep Tanya sneaks into her room, goes to the old patchwork quilt under which her grandmother sleeps, and then proceeds to cut it up without asking anyone for permission.  I don't know about you, but if I woke up and found that my quilt had been lovingly vandalized in this way I might get a little bit tetchy.  Tanya never gets in trouble for it since her motives were pure.  Still, it's an odd little addition.  I mean, couldn't she at least have asked permission?  	 Jerry Pinkey, artist extraordinaire, was the man responsible for the illustrations.  I'm not a huge fan of his work, but he does a lovely job with this book.  The quilt looks very real.  My grandmother made me one back that was very similar to the one presented on the cover.  I'll admit right here and now that since this book was written in 1985, it's swimming in nostalgia for me.  I love the 80s hair and clothes that people wear in it.  From Grandma's gigantic glasses to Mama's shirt/vest combinations and shoulder pads, children of the eightiese will find themselves swimming in memories.  Remember polo shirts that had collars that were different colors from the fabric of the shirt themselves?  Remember shirts that had ruffles for no particular reason at all?  It's all here.  But for kids, this won't serve as a distraction since they won't recognize the era.  Plus, Pinkney cleverly  included some dated elements, but not a lot.  If I didn't point out to you that it was written over 20 years ago, you might never notice it yourself. 	 The children who grew up with this book are having kids of their own these days.  I dare say that for some, "The Patchwork Quilt" will be the first title they purchase for their children and the children of their friends.  Arresting and emotional without playing those same emotions for cheap, Florunoy's book is her best known work.  If you should be particularly fond of it, be sure to check out its sequel, "Tanya's Reunion", written ten years later.  A necessary read 
 I read the novel in a day and  half. The charaters in the book have some, fine qualities, and like all humans have faults The other reviewers, complain about the anti-Mormonsim.While the Mormons were the object of considerblae bigoty,  in truth  the Mormons of the time   were ferociously territorial and hostile to outsiders, They also had the tendency to shoot first ask questions later.  This book I highly recommend.  
 I am a "space nut".  I have read numerous books, seen numerous vhs and dvd stories of everything from the start of the space age to the shuttle flights.  I have never had a more inspiring feeling than upon finishing "Light this candle".  It started a little slow with all the early life details of Shepard but, helped later in the book with how & why he reacted to many (and I mean many) tough situations that he faced in his unbelievable life.  Being a space nut, I was happy to see little details explained in the book that are lacking in other books I have read.  Such things as Shepard talking about laying in the LEM following an EVA on Apollo 14.  He and Mitchell were supposed to be sleeping but Shepard talked about the "eerie silence" and hearing the A/C unit click on and off.  Also, feeling like they were going to tilt over and falling out of the bunk when he thought the LEM was sliding down the edge of the crater.  All of these things made it a "tough to put down" book that I would HIGHLY recommend. I used to think of Al Shepard as an egotistical, bi-polar, spoiled fly-boy that I wanted no part in learning more about.  I would have rather stuck to anyone of the other 6 Mercury astronauts.  BOY WAS I WRONG!  This book might have turned me to thinking that Al Shepard is the most interesting of the original 7 
 Very informative book. Lots of examples and tips on what would work, workarounds on getting things to work and what doesn't presently work in what browser. Nice not working on something only to find out after many hours that is either not supported or supported weakly.Teach Yourself Body Language provides the reader with the knowledge to use and interpret body language more effectively. It includes practical exercises that will enhance your understanding of non-verbal communication and explores the use of body language in personal and professional situations 
 This movie experience is that solid. A Masterpiece in film! BRAVO 
 I had never previously read books that dealt with Hitler or World War II before reading this one.  Like every other Baby Boomer, I've seen enough films and TV shows to write my own WWII movie that most people would probably find credible.  What we know of the war is about the fighting, the arrests of those pronounced "undesirable" by the Nazis, children denouncing their parents to the authorities, the concentration camps, etc.  The Germany that Hitler presented to his people was a forward-looking state of culture and enlightenment, the acme of modern civilization.  People want to believe the best about themselves.  Hitler had an instinctive sense of theatre, a passion for ritual, and the desire to make everyone in the entire world subservient to him, as well as the power to squelch all opposition.  In some ways, he was visionary.  The Volkswagen was mostly his idea.  (It was created to justify his building of the Autobahn, which is still one of the wonders of modern Germany.)  But he wanted everyone to have HIS taste.  Only his taste was acceptable.  Everything else was either kitsch or decadent.  Disagreement meant losing one's job in most cases or, in some extreme cases, a one-way ticket to Auschwitz.  Of course, the most troubling aspect of Hitler was how he could have gotten so many people to go along with him.  For me this book explains it.  I think this is an important book that made me see things from a different perspective.  Parts of the book made me drop my jaw.  "Awesome" is an overused word, but it really is the applicable term here.  The author made me extremely interested in a subject that basically had little appeal for me.  I want to do a lot more reading about this subject now.  Spotts' book is a knockout.  It gets five stars from me 
 I was a little tentative to order the iTrip LCD because of some of the bad reviews I read.  It seems like there are very few people sitting on the fence with this item.  Buyers either love it or hate it.    I was leaving for a trip and hoped the iTrip would arrive so I could use it on my drive.  As luck would have it, it was in my mailbox the day before I left.  I unwrapped it and went out to the vehicle to test it.    I plugged it into my 20GB iPod photo and right off the bat thought I had trouble.  It wouldn't power up, I tried plugging and unplugging, cleaning the contacts and finally as a last resort, read the instructions.  After plugging it in you have to play the song before it will power on.  This immediately explains why so many poeple complain of DOAs right out of the box.    I set the frequency to the lowest available on the FM band and presto!!! instant music.  I don't live in an extremely populated area so I can't really comment on other stations bleeding through but loud passages are loud and quiet passages are quiet.    Many reviewers complained of bad sound quality but you must remember this.  It doesn't matter how great the quality of the song is on your iPod, you are playing it over FM radio so it will never sound better than FM radio.    I inherited my father's '91 Accord work car when he retired and it has a bare bones AM/FM radio with a tone control(bass AND treble all rolled into one handy knob!!!) and cheap 6 1/2 inch speakers in the front doors.  When I drive I like to listen to talk radio and podcasts and occasionally music.  The sound quality was exactly what I expected, no better and no worse.    I also tested it in my wife's '01 Focus.  It has a nice factory 6 speaker CD system and the sound from the iPod was just fine.  The bass still thumped and the highs seemed just a tiny bit off but still not bad at all.  I am completely satisfied with the product.    One strange thing that I noticed that may explain why some people complain of bad sound quality is if you tap on the iTrip, the sound comes through your speakers much like tapping on a microphone.  If you were to lay it on a hard surface in your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road.    Unless there was a defective batch sent out, I don't know where all of the complaints come from.  I got mine for $15 from a private seller on Amazon and consider it a great purchase especially for that amount of money. Don't hesitate to buy one, it works as advertised and the sound quality is what it is.  If you keep these things in mind, you won't be disappointed 
 When i was in high school history class,we read very little about the Vietnam conflict.The teacher just did not have the time to give the topic justice.So it was glossed over ,as were many other political topics.Tempus Fugit.The Vietnam topic did make me ask one important question,'Was the involvment of Americans ,in the Vietnam civil war ,really worth it?'.The answer was an absolute, 'No'.After so many years of reading history books and researching accounts of the Vietnam war,i have come to the conclusion that democracy was not the main goal ,being offered by the American government.America was simply being used by Western European Nato interests to 'break the communist hold on South-east Asia'.Why? The OSS-CIA wanted to continue heroin dealing from Afgahnistan and China,yet Korea and Vietnam would be 'stumbling blocks'.Ho Chin Mihn was a Northern Vietnamese socialist,from a rural farming area.He would have become a 'Viet-Nazi',had he ignored furthering his personal education.When he labored,in France,he saw the abuses of other colonial servants. He was a Leninist,who was thrust into the Stalinist role,when the foreign polemic militaries became involved.Ho Chi Mihn said,'When the elephant provokes the docile tiger,the tiger will fight and wear-down the elephant,and the elephant will fall'. It seems history has proven Ho Chi Mihn right.     
 Hawaii is one of the most beautiful, bittersweet movies ever made. From the opening prologue with Keoki (Manu Tupou) relating the history of the Hawaiian people over the glorious music of Elmer Bernstein I knew I was going to love this movie.   Keoki, a native Hawaiian and first convert to the Christian faith has traveled across the ocean to America in hopes of convincing some of the upcoming graduates of a Calvinist College in New England to sail to Hawaii and share their faith with his people.  Amongst those to accept the challenge is Abner Hale (Max Von Sydow) a young man of good intentions, but overzealous and prideful in his Christianity. Unable to join in the missionary effort unless he is married, one is arranged for him with the lovely Jerusha Bromley (Julie Andrews).  The hardships of the sea voyage are only a taste of the hardship that face them once they arrive at their destination. As the new arrivals acclimate themselves to their new surroundings Jerusha soon falls in love with the open and loving nature to the natives while Abner grows more narrow and unbending in his proselytization efforts. Unable to appreciate the beauty around him, he sees only heathens doomed to hell for their pagan ways.  Abner eventually loses sight of the Christian message to "love one another" and in a fit of range calls upon God to bring death and destruction to the unrepentant Hawaiians. When a measles epidemic spreads through the islands it appears Abner prayer has been answered with dire consequences.    A poignant and ultimately sad tale of the lose of yet another native 'land of paradise' brought about the greed and lack of concern by foreign powers.   MGM only receives -4 Stars- on this DVD. Why in the world they didn't restore 'Hawaii' to its full 189 minutes theatrical version instead of releasing this truncated 161 minute version is beyond me. Come on MGM, try again 
 This is one of my absolute favorite books of all time. It's one of my comfort books--I can always pick it up and become lost in it when I want to read my troubles away.   Though the reading level is such that younger readers can read it comfortably, it is not so patronizing that older readers are bored by it. Add to that an interesting, thought-provoking and clever twist on one of the Grimm Brothers most well-known fairytales, this is a novel I'd reccomend to anyone and everyone!  (If you liked this book, Once Upon a Marigold is a novel with a similar world and mood you might enjoy. If you like re-tellings of fairy tales, Beauty by McKinley and The Goose Girl by Hale are other good books to try. 
 This utterance comes halfway through Michael Dregni's book, and it's one of maybe 50 direct quotes by Django Reinhardt drizzled over 280 pages. Self-conscious about his lack of education, Reinhardt didn't like talking to "gadjé." He is known to have written three letters in his life, and the most extended quote is bogus: an "interview" concocted by an impresario to defame a rival.  It has to be quite a challenge for a biographer to work with so little material. And yet Dregni does an excellent job. While by necessity he has to rely on external testimony and events to make his portrayal, his focus is always on Reinhardt and the extraordinary contradictions of the man: one night dining with royalty, the next night stealing a chicken on a country road; living in a luxury hotel one week, a caravan the next; over-generosity alternating with infuriating pettiness; turning one gig into an all-night jam session, not bothering to show up for the next. You think you know Bohemian? This is Bohemian.  Of course, Django was only verbally reticent. Musically, he is one of the most articulate, expressive players ever. So it's the musical parts of this book that really shine. Partly because of the nationalism of his promoters who wanted to push a French jazz musician, but mostly because of his magical talent (and in spite of a tendency to sleep later than recording session schedules), Reinhardt's output was vast and varied. As I imagine is true for many, I knew the Quintette/Grapelli recordings to the exclusion of almost everything else. So I especially appreciated the discussions of his later career: the weird fact that during the Occupation, when jazz was officially verboten, he achieved his greatest popularity, and his enthusiasm for bebop, which I've always thought he anticipated with his angular, superfast playing.  In the endnotes are many mentions of "interview with author, 2001/2/3..." Aside from the documentary research, Dregni deserves special gratitude for contacting people who knew Reinhardt and who will probably not be around much longer. His efforts have doubtless uncovered facts that, because of the large part of Reinhardt's life that exists only in the oral tradition, would certainly have been lost without them.  Django Reinhardt, one of the more remarkable and mysterious characters of his time, deserves a first-rate biography. This is it. 
 I only bought this a week ago, and it's far better than I expected. One thing I like about the DVD is that it's not wretchedly over-produced like so many other concert DVDs I have. Definately check out the rare shots of the audience during Hurt and Piggy. It's cool seeing Trent get off the stage and go half-way into an audience of tearfull fans during Piggy(not to mention Trent leaving the microphone in the audinece for the fans to sing "nothing can stop me now!"). NIN's songs are even more incredible live, they really are. It's funny watching Trent pushing the guitarist around that's doing the guitar solo with a wah-wah peddle on Sin, and watching him rasing his fist when he says, "your fist!" Probably the most emotional part of the concert is when NIN performs Hurt. It's more amazing live than it is on The Downward Spiral, as Trent screams the vocals instead of whispering them like on the record.   Definately buy this if you're a fan of Trent's. And All That Could've Been is a great concert. I hope that I'll be able to attend a NIN concert some day.    
 It may be not as consistant as the 2nd and 3rd one but it has standout songs on it I bought it to complete my collection but it is still goo 
 This book by Frank Abagnale has helped me greatly.  Thank you Frank 
 This is one program I really don't care how historically accurate it is - Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole are such a joy to watch. 
 For those of us who have been fortunate enough to have a glimpse of the mystery and majesty, that surrounds some of the hidden Himalayan kingdoms, this music will sound most familiar. Photographer and director of the film Himalaya, Eric Valli, has dedicated many years in capturing the essence of the people of Dolpo, Nepal. For years this tiny kingdom has been isolated from the rest of the world because of it's geographical location. The threat that the unique nomadic existence of these noble people will disappear, is very much a reality, hence the urge to portray the struggle and beauty of Dolpo on film. More than a movie, this is a living testimony of a culture interconnected to all of us.  Bruno Coulais has captured the heart, spirit and mystery of the remarkable people of Dolpo. The soundtrack is evocative and without images transports us to the magical world somewhere between heaven and earth. From the intricacies of Buddhist faith to the grandeur of the highest mountains on earth, the music on this soundtrack has it all.  
 George Washington was a complex man- and became, even in his own lifetime, an icon.  However, Ellis, author of the book Founding Brothers as well as American Sphinx (about Thomas Jefferson), does an excellent job of helping us understand Washington as a young officer, a Virginia squire, the commanding general of a revolutionary army and finally the first President of the newly formed United States of America.  But Ellis superbly paints Washington's character-- what he was like beneath the surface.   First, he found an  ambitious man with strong self-control. He explores this self-control and the effect it had on Washington and those around him.   Ellis also describes Washington as a visionary who understood, far better than Jefferson & Hamilton, the future of the young American nation.  Ellis believes that this is one of the most defining things of greatness in Washington- and I would agree.  I have two other books on Washington in my library.  This one is head and shoulders above the others and is one of the better books I have read in the past five years 
 I finished this extraordinary book and opened it up again and re-read it. The writing is that breathtaking (there were paragraphs I read outloud to friends on the phone). I share most of my books with friends, but this one I refuse to let leave the house--despite promises of a quick return. So the people I tell are buying two copies at a time.  We all know "Grapes of Wrath" and have heard of the Dust Bowl, but never, did I ever realize what really happened through all those years.  Thank you, Mr. Egan, for remembering these people, reminding us of our history, and helping put our lives in perspective 
  This work takes giant steps with the history of science and cosmology. From the Big Bang to Life, from Copernicus to Lovelock, Professor Gribbin advances the theory of complex order from simple rules.   A reader familiar with complexity theory may feel they have heard all this before. Professor Gribbin however takes a very mathematical approach to the subject and delivers am interesting and readable account of his subject.    I recommend this work to serious lay readers (casual science readers may find the math daunting, although just appreciating the author's enthusiasm will be infectious) and to a general academic audience. The scope is vast but engagingly presented and readable.  Throughout the work Professor Gribbin goes on tangents and then announces that it is out of the scope of the present work. I challenge the good professor to write a new work on just those tangents. I for one will be happy to read it. 
 I'm still reading this book and cannot put it down!  Reading about what Michael Jordan is like and the personal and business decisions he's made, which have also made him successful, make me want to be more like him.  Very inspiring!  Thank you, Michael! 
 This book is a good introduction to 1 e4 Nf6 whether you play it with White or Black.    The author has some recommendations about how to play it.  With White, he advises the main line (1 e4 Nf6 2 e5 Nd5 3 d4 d6 4 Nf3), and he gives advice on how to play it solidly or tactically and theoretically.   I figured this book wouldn't help me with White, since I play 2 Nc3.  But Cox does give a game that goes 1 e4 Nf6 2 Nc3 d5 3 e5 Ne4 4 Nce2 d4 5 c3.  That's a good line for White, and Black would be better off with 2...e5, letting White choose between a Vienna and a Four Knights.  Now, what about the Alekhine with Black?  You may say you don't play it!  But what if you get in a blindfold game, and your opponent plays 1 d4 Nf6 2 e5 (only now do you discover that White's first move was 1 e4).  Or maybe you are in a 5-minute game and you want to have some fun with Black and not play your main defence.  The author boasts that you can be prepared to meet 1 e4 in 30 minutes.  Against the main line, you can try 4...dxe5 5 Nxe5 c6.  Against 1 e4 Nf6 2 e5 Nd5 3 d4 d6 4 c4, you play 4...Nb6 5 f4 (if 5 exd6 exd6) dxe5 6 fxe5 c5 7 d5 g6.  Against 1 e4 Nf6 2 e5 Nd5 3 c4 Nb6 4 c5 Nd5 5 Nc3, you play 5...c6, intending to follow this up with ...e6 and ...b6.  If White plays 1 e4 Nf6 2 e5 Nd5 3 Nc3, you play 3...Nxc3 and 4...d5.  And if White avoids the Alekhine with 1 e4 Nf6 2 Nc3, you play 2...e5, settling for that Vienna game.  The author also gives recommendations for positional and tactical repertoires for Black.  Years ago, I tried playing the Alekhine in four games.  Two opponents played the main line.  I tried 4...dxe5 5 Nxe5 g6 (which Cox devotes two games to).  The first time I saw this, I continued as Cox recommends, with 6 Bc4 c6.  But I soon got in trouble.  In the other game, I answered 6 Bc4 with 6...Be6.  It's not in this book, but I think it's a good choice.  My other two opponents tried 1 d4 Nf6 2 e5 Nd5 3 Nc3 Nxc3 4 dxc3 d6.  Now I expected 5 Bc4.  I intended to reply 5...Nc6 (not 5...dxe5?? 6 Bxf7, losing the Black Queen) 6 Nf3 dxe5 7 Qxd8+, which is acceptable for Black.  But instead, one opponent tried 5 Bf4 dxe5 6 Qxd8+ Kxd8 7 0-0-0+ Bd7 8 Bxe5 f6 9 Bg3 e5, after which I was okay.  The other came up with 5 Nf3 dxe5 6 Qxd8+ Kxd8 7 Nxe5 Ke8, which led to a tough fight.    This book is up-to-date and easy to read.  I recommend it.   
 I bought this book for my son, who is a sailor and lives aboard his sailboat.  He said it was great. I didn't see it, but for that application, it was just what he was looking for 
      "Hearts Over Fences" is a mature romance that portays characters who are actually complex enough to make believable the entanglements in which they find themselves.  The book manages to escape the "fairy tale" scenario so common to the genre.  Instead, it actually deals with real people working out real problems.  The sophistication of the novel makes it appealing to both female and male readers alike, including many readers who would not normally open the cover of a novel that could be dsignated, "romance."  This is partly due to the integrity of the characters, and partly due to the depth of the knowledge that is put forward by the writer.  Toni Leland proves herself to be very well informed to all things about horses, as well as the inside workings of the equestrian community.      From the opening sentence through the last closing comment, "Hearts Over Fences" is a captivating read. 
 I really enjoyed reading this book.  The author is well informed and knows the country.  The book ends before the Orange Revolution, but is a wonderful introduction to a great country and people.  
 I have read all three of these pretty much back to back and enjoyed them all.  I love the honesty of the writing, the sense of the times and places, the way the characters are created and the style of plot suspense build-up unusual in this genre of literature 
 A great resource for drum lovers. Details on all the major drum companies and some I had never heard of. Also has historic pictures of the people and places. Highly reccommend 
    Baby has really picked it up on this album.  For the last few years, Cash Money Records has been in serious decline, with their artist seeming to rehash the same material over and over again on every production, and Bryan Williams "AKA Baby Birdman", the former CEO, has been hit the hardest.  His somewhat anticipated debut album "Baby AKA The #1 Stunna", only worsened the situation, recieving major criticism for its endless rhymes about cars, bling, weed, and money that it typical of CM, and essentially threw Baby out of the spotlight permenantly.  Lil Wayne, the only really popular artist out of his clique, has had to hold Cash Money up for a long time.  On this album, however, Baby has made a huge comeback.      It seems almost too good to be true.  On "Fast Money", The Birdman has come a long way, erasing his off-beat rhymes from albums such as "Big Money Heavyweight" forever.  His flow and lyrical game are incredible, like nothing you would ever dream he could be capable of.  Though Baby stays within the usual rap topics (Drugs, girls, guns), like his first album, he makes a much larger effort to expand upon it, rapping a lot more about personal experiences in the rap and street game than driving fast cars and having a good time.  Songs like "Neck of the Woods", and "We Got That" really display this.  The beats of tracks such as "Get It All Together", "My Territory", and "We Gettin' It On", among others, will have you bobbing your head and bouncing out of your chair.  Despite the title of the album, Baby shows almost none of the typical Cash Money influence, with the last song on the CD being the only track that rhymes about nothing but stacking cash and "pipes and big rims", and its still one of the best songs!  His choice of guest performences are also great, with Bun B absolutely tearing the first verse of "Ghetto Life" up, along with the chorus, and Lil' Wayne making a perfect duet partner for BM on both "Neck of the Woods" and "Get Your Shine On".  Other artists such as Chop (Who is this guy?  He needs to release a solo album quick!) and 6-Shot make huge contributions to several tracks.         To say this is one of Cash Money's best productions ever would be an understatement, with FM containing some of the most solid rapping I have seen in a long time, surpasing all of their major releses of 2004-2005, including Mannie Fresh's debut, and even "Tha Carter II".  Literally every song on the entire album adds something new or different.  Give it a chance, you will not be disappointed by this albu 
 This is a great book.  Of course, you must be interested in The Declaration of Independence.  I didn't find it boring at all, it was facinating how you journey from the town declarations, to the big one we  all know.  It also explains very nicely how the DofI has been viewed  throughout US history.  We used this information in a constitution  competition, and came in 4th place in the entire nation 
 This... on HDTV... is just like in an IMAX!  I'm an earth science teacher, and I can tell you this mesmerized the class.  In fact, it's great for life science as well 
 Posner has written a great book on why America failed to stop 9/11 and has uncovered new information along the way.  Posner details the rise of militant Islam in the US, the rise of Bin Laden, terrorism funding, blown chances to stop 9/11, and shocking new info on countries that may have known about 9/11.  The missed oppurtunities by the CIA and the FBI to stop 9/11 have been widely reported and there really isn't much new info.  The parts I enjoyed were the chapters "Jihad in America", "The Interrogation", and the chapter on terrorism financing.  Militant Islam has been around for a long time.  Posner discusses its rise during the 90s and how people were preaching hatred towards America for a long time.  Guess where most of the money comes from for terrorism?  From US charities.  Many of them are fronts for terrorists.  The last chapter is probably the best in the book.  I would say about half the chapters of the book are new information.  Posner rereports some open facts for about half the book, but the other half is definitely worth the read 
 I had to read this book because I'm currently taking a history of science class taught by the author at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and I just want to say it's excellent. It is clear, concise and (best of all from a student's point of view) not boring. It teaches you so much about looking at things in context. This is a great book from a great professor 
 This album is a must for any music fan with an I.Q. over 12 
 hieroglyphics is real rap. so much better then the 50 cent garbage that is out in mainstream today...if you love rap, buy this album 
 Luckily my wife knew this book as I had never heard of it.  At first I was concerned about the story line as I read it (thinking of what goes on in Bull fights and my little girl) but the story is masterful written and the pictures are well done as to eliminate concern.  Ferdinand is a gentle bull that loves to smell flowers under a tree rather then play, play bump heads, and dream of being in the bull fights in Madrid.   One day a group comes looking for the biggest toughest bull they can find.  Ferdinand was going to do his usual thing of sitting under a tree and smelling flowers but he sits on a Bee.   He gets stung and charges around like crazy and so they pick him.  My girl doesn't like bees as she was stung by one.   However, the look on Ferdinand's face made it funny for her.  Ferdinand goes to the fights and simply sits in the middle of the ring and  smells the scent from the flowers in women's hair.  Nothing will make him fight and he angers, depresses and makes the matadors cry since they can't show off.  He is returned to his field and quickly returns to sitting under his tree and smelling the flowers.  It's a sweet story and I think I will be reading it for a long time.  
 This is our second copy.......we use it so much, the pages were wearing out!  Consistently outstanding recipes 
 This book provides everything you ever wanted to know about the Chabad movement and more. Fishkoff, an American Jewish journalist who is not Orthodox, was granted a remarkable amount of entree into  the Chabad community and took full advantage of it. This is a sympathetic portrait, though not an unquestioning one.  As a reasonably knowledgeable Jew and a former journalist myself, I found that Fishkoff answered all the questions I had about Chabad. For example: Where do the "shlichim" (emissaries) get all their money from? (Answer: they have to fund-raise for themselves. They only receive moral support and educational materials from Chabad central headquarters.)   Notably, Fishkoff directly addresses the more controversial aspects of Chabad. She discusses their extraordinarily interesting relationships with Conservative and Reform Jews. Briefly, Chabad welcomes less-observant Jews and does not demand that they adopt Hasidic or Orthodox practices; it officially denies recognition to non-Orthodox synagogues and rabbis, but often creates de facto alliances with them "on the ground."  Fishkoff also addresses the controversy over messianism that continues to divide the Chabad movement. She is perhaps more optimistic than some other observers that support will soon die down for the view that the late Lubavitcher rebbe, who died in 1994, was the Messiah. She also gives a full account of the Chabad movement's concerted efforts to place Chanukah menorahs in public places -- and the court battles this has engendered, which often place Chabad on the opposite side of civil liberties groups and of many other Jewish organizations 
 Wow! By the grace of God, I was blown away by this book! In these pages, I was given great insight into the profound relationship between Scripture and Liturgy and how we participate in the saving grace of Christ. I am astounded by the fact that the Liturgy makes present "the works brought about by God in the history of salvation." (p. 101 quoting John Paul II) and that I'm able to share in their graces today!     In my opinion, this is the best work by Dr. Scott Hahn so far.  It is warmly written coming from his heart as well as his mind.  I enjoyed how he interwoven the themes of covenant, tradition, economy of salvation, typology, and mystagogy.    This book helped me to revitalized my knowledge and participation in the sacraments. I am very grateful to God and to Dr. Scott Hahn.  
 In his most readable book, Shepard lays out his thesis that the fundamental nature of humans was formed by our hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers, and that our subsequent lives as nomadic  pastoralists or settled agriculturalists have been very destructive not  only of our surroundings but of our psyches.  The problems created by these  last two ways of life have been described by other authors (e.g., Jared  Diamond, in The Third Chimpanzee), but Shepard's  treatment is rich and  impressive.  Shepard's language is, in fact, often beautiful, although it  is not easy, principally because of vocabulary.  This book was the last of  four read by the students in my freshman Human Evolution class this past  term.  About 3/4 of them found it fairly difficult going, but many also  found it very rewarding--in fact it deeply affected several.  I thought the  book's weaknesses were (1) its lack of well-developed ideas about how to  reconnect with our Pleistocene heritage, given that we are now stuck with  agriculture (and industrialism, etc.)--Shepard presents a long list of  possibilities in the last chapter, but many are very unrealistic (and he  does not include the learning and practicing of "primitive"  technologies, such as making fire by friction, making stone tools,  braintanning hides, and so on--a powerful, deeply satisfying way to  understand our common past), and (2) his near failure to acknowledge that  agriculture can be practiced well, that it need not be destructive, and  that it can give one a strong and healthy connection to the land.  (Shepard  in a chapter endnote does praise Wendell Berry, Wes Jackson, and Gary  Snyder for their sort of farming.) These problems are, however, minor; this  is an important book, and should be read by any interested in human  evolution 
 I loved this companion to the series.  I have a hard time picturing places on a map in my head, so this really cleared up a number of geographical questions I've accumulated over reading the series.  The booklet is also a lot of fun.  I'd definitely recommend to Discworld fans 
 “In Lasting Leadership, we identify eight attributes or qualities that have enabled the 25 individuals (Of the 25 leaders profiled in this book, two have died – Sam Walton in 1992 and Mary Kay Ash in 2001. We were able to get interviews with 15 of the other 23, including Jeff Bezos, John Bogle, James Burke, Michael Dell, William George, Louis Gerstner, Lee Iacocca, Herb Kelleher, Andrew Grove, Peter Lynch, Charles Schwab, Fred Smith, Ted Turner, Jack Welch, and Muhammad Yunus, in addition to Mary Kay Ash’s son, Richard Rogers) to overcome major challenges as well as to nurture their own leadership styles. These attributes – each of which has its own chapter in the book – include   •	Building a strong corporate culture  •	Truth telling  •	Finding and catering to under-served markets  •	‘Seeing the invisible’ – that is, spotting potential winners or faint trends before their rivals or customers do  •	Using price to build competitive advantage  •	Managing and building their organization’s brand (which, in some cases, may be their own name)  •	Being fast learners  •	Managing risk  None of the leaders in this book has all these attributes. If that were a requirement of lasting leadership, the world would have no leaders at all. At the same time, one attribute alone is not enough to ensure long-lived leadership. A leader with a single attribute may succeed briefly, but the success will not be sustained unless other qualities exist to keep the momentum going (from the Introduction).”   In this context, to explore the theme of lasting leadership, Mukul Pandya and Robbie Shell divide this invaluable handbook into ten chapters. Each of the chapters from one to nine takes a close look at 25 leaders’ approach to leadership.   Finally, in the last chapter – conclusion, Pandya and Shell say that “the lives of the 25 leaders covered in these pages are instructive because of the choices they made – often in the face of adversity – on their way to defining success in their respective fields. Their experiences suggest questions worth considering when assessing the leadership potential of ourselves or others:  •	Do we seek the positive seam when confronted with circumstances?  •	How do we cultivate a corporate culture that inspires and empowers those around us?  •	How do we emphasize the importance of honesty, especially at times when honesty is not the easiest course to pursue?  •	Have we sought to identify and cultivate underserved markets?  •	Can we see the invisible? Are we able to dig deeper and understand the connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena?  •	Do we understand the role of price as a potential competitive advantage in our particular industry?  •	Do we cultivate and maximize brand identity?  •	Are we fast learners, able to make decisions quickly and reserve position when necessary?  •	How well do we manage risk? (pp.240-241)”  Strongly recommended 
 I have little to add to the other reviewers. Gene Vincent was the true bad boy of rock & roll. His songs inspired the next generation of rockers - see John Lennon cover "Be Bop a Lula" on his "Rock & Roll" album. Love "Race with the Devil," "Pink Thunderbird," and the others. The guitars soar, the beat is basic, but listen for the screams. They are ripping loose in the studio, pedal to the metal, closing their eyes and taking their hands off the wheels. Not for nothin' - they died on the same road as Marc Bolan in T. Rex. A dead man's turn for rockstars past and future. To not own Gene Vincent in your collection is to have big, gaping hole. All his best in one place. Buy now. You won't regret it 
 This book is by no means for expert programmer.  It is written to explain HTML basics to folks who do not understand web programming.  Wendy did a great job to introduce HTML to beginners with his emphasis on important information in this area. I find his writing simple and right to the point.  The book does not bother to get into details that could easily confuse his target audience.  To some folks who would like to get more HTML details, they should have read the book title before buying.  Comparing with other introductory text in this area, this is the best for the beginner folks 
 There's a saying among statisticians (a group I identify with from time to time): "You can always draw a straight line with two points."  Loosely translated, this means that you should avoid drawing conclusions based on fewer than 3 observations.  This being my third Brother Cadfael mystery (I obtained a random selection from a neighbor's giveaway bin), I feel I can now opine more confidently, knowing that my recommendations are probably not based on a coincidental selection of the best the author has to offer.  As always, the author provides us with a fascinating and unparalleled look into life in medieval England, with particular focus on monastery life.  This installment, however, is less of a whodunit than the others.  The principal crime was committed hundreds of miles away from Cadfael's home in Shrewsbury and all he has to go on are some second or third-hand accounts and some unusual visitors at the annual pilgrimage in honor of St. Winifred.  In some ways, the mystery solves itself, with Cadfael simply providing a nudge here and there to bring the matter to conclusion.  For those interested in 12th century English history, there is an especially potent dose of it here, as the brewing civil war between Empress Maud and King Stephen comes to a head.  Wading through these details makes this a bit more difficult of a read than usual.  One interesting upshot of this part of the story is the implication that it is possible for political (if not military) enemies to be civil and gentlemanly with each other.  What a novel concept!  The book also explores the nature of revenge, and the ultimate lack of fulfillment in it.  This, too, is a concept that is mostly foreign in today's world.  Romance is again a significant feature, always a pleasant surprise given that the setting is a monastery.  In this case, however, the romance is relatively conventional and only peripherally related to the crime.  It does however, provide useful clues for resolving the mystery.  Another subplot relates to a mysterious visitor whose past is connected with Cadfael's, resulting in a surprise revelation at the end of the book.  Cadfael also engages in a good deal of introspection regarding miraculous divine intervention, as befitting the occasion of the pilgrimage.  In summary, this book continues the tradition of solid storytelling and fascinating reading established by the author in the Brother Cadfael series.  Both novitiates and long-time fans of the series will enjoy this book 
 it's a short story - only 5 pages, which was dissapointing at first. but the different textures fascinate my 14 mo old daughter. she loves to go through it constantly 
 I am a substitute teacher and I take this book with me to every job. The kids love it!! It's the perfect length for reading aloud (not too long!) and the pictures are great! I give each character a different voice (Mrs.Ferdman's is the Wicked Witch of the West) I recommend you or your child try that when you read it. It's silly but it's really fun. Grades K-5 love to hear it, but it's good reading for 2-3 graders. Kids want to read more of Chocolatina but this is the only book- hopefully someday there will be another 
 This book was pleseant to read because Socrates was accused of corrupting of young Greek people's mind. Socrates made mockery of his trial. Eventually, he was convicted and was order to drink poison to die 
 Vandana Shiva has become one of the most outspoken defenders of biodiversity and the commons, persistently working to advance the public understanding of a complicated history of corporate and legislative decisions that have changed the landscape of our lives and the lives of people the world over.  She has contributed to a vital dialogue about the effects of globalization and the silent tragedies that are occuring every day because of strange business practices and the relentless politics of the new manifest destiny.  "Biopiracy: The Plunder of Nature and Knowledge" is a succinct and accessible introduction to the issue of patents and corporate control of the natural world.  Shiva is an articulate educator who writes about the difficult and often unspoken history of corporate exploitation of the knowledge of non-Western cultures.  By arguing vehemently for the preservation of the farmer's right to save seeds, as well as local rights to ecological and historically tested uses of the natural world, Shiva outlines an ethical path for movement forward and for responding proactively to unfair business practices.  I read this book in the context of a larger look at the world's food supply from an ecological and political perspective, but it speaks to a wide audience and can reach far in spreading truth about what is happening in our world - much of which is not getting reported in the mainstream media.  
 Joaquin Jackson provides an insightful excursion into the mind and deeds of a Texas Ranger.  He does not attempt to aggrandize his labors, and expresses reasonable concern about how political agendas can and often do impede effective law enforcement. There are passages that were seemingly added by a technical writer (e.g., description of the terrain and historical points), which detract from the highly personal message that comes from the heart and soul of Ranger Jackson.  As a professor who works with law enforcement, I increased my awareness of how the officer must be highly dedicated and willing to sacrifice personal gain for public service, as well as face a constant barrage of criticism from many sources and accept that threat to safety is a ever-present condition.  This book is excellent for understanding the psychology of a Texas Ranger 
 This was a very good movie that I watched in my "Horror Classics Collection: 50 Pack" (ASIN: B0001HAGTM) that I got from Amazon (for under $20.00!).  So first off, I would recommend buying the 50 pack where you get 2 other Vincent Price movies (The Bat and The Last Man On Earth) and 47 other good movies for almost the same price as buying this movie by itself.  As far as this movie goes, there are a few suspenseful parts and you wonder what is going to happen.  Mainly, the movie will give you some memorable quotes, as Vincent Price will always deliver with that great voice of his.  All of the characters do a good job acting (and the typist has a great scream!).  Some parts seem to be a bit unbelievable and some questions don't seem to get answered, but who really cares?  At only 75 minutes long, this movie is better than most of the horror movies that come out today that are unoriginal and go for shock value.  So while this might be more of a murder mystery than a "horror" movie, it is worth a watch and you'll be satisfied at the end...unless of course, you do not like black and white movies, and if that is the case, then you probably wouldn't be reading this review.  P.S. I love in Gary F. Taylor's review when he says: "Price plays it in a slightly prissy, very high-camp manner with a tremendous dose of the black humor for which he was so famous."  That's so true 
 Rudolph's study of the history of American higher education is considered a premier work in this body of knowledge.  It traces the development of the American college and university from the pre-revolution seminary through today's large, multi-line land grant and private instituions and provides insight into the people and events which shaped these institutions and our country.  A must for any historian or education scholar 
 it seems the tradition of retelling life-stories in tibet was largely for  teaching purposes. this book does that part well. a valuable support for  the depressed yogini 
 It's no denying Peter Carey is a brilliant writer. His flair for pin-pointing the nuances of the good old Aussie vernacular is spot-on, and his characters are always society's off-cuts, but ultimately likeable souls.  Theft: A Love Story was a highly enjoyable and recommended read. But unlike his brilliant True History of the Kelly Gang, it seems that Carey wasn't sure how to end this wonderful tale, and lets it fizzle out rather than leave you with the same enthusiasm you had for it in the beginning 
 I havent gotten these before but they look like a good pair of binoculars.I suggest adding these to your wish list if you like the outdoors 
 I got this icecream scoop as part of a set. Not only does it look great in my kitchen, I just made banana splits tonight for my kids and it cut through the icecream effortlessly. Love the color, love the product! 
 I like Cheyenne, Maverick, Bronco, Lawman...Warner Brothers Westerns from the late 50's and early 60's.  You know, whoever is in charge of distribution would do very well to put these programs out for sale in blocks of one year.  I would buy each and every year made available of all the shows I listed above.  And, you know what?  I believe that there are a lot of people out there who feel just like me.  Hey guys!  Hello!  You would make a profit and we would have what we want:  every episode of every season of all of our favorites!  Thank You 
 Yes, I'm one of those baby-boomers contemplating moving into the "third-age" - when the kids have left the nest, the mortgage is paid off, the college accounts have been funded, the husband is semi-retired, but I'm still working, contributing the max to the 401K, and starting to wonder "what next"? No more ladders to climb career-wise, finally the time to think about pursuing hobbies, traveling and the freedom to "re-invent" myself. But, as what? I still haven't figured that out, but I'm sure it will evolve over time. The answers weren't laid out in the book, however, it definitely gave food for thought, and it is a good starting place for those contemplating such a life passage.  Much of the content of Dychtwald's book validated what I already knew about the "third-age" - we'll be living longer and healthier, we'll have new freedoms, we'll have clout in the marketplace (as members of the largest population bubble - the boomers), we'll be open to change, we can't depend on Social Security, etc. Some of the chapters gave me something to look forward to "See, Feel, Taste and Touch the World", "Lifelong Learning Adventures". The chapter on "Achieving Financial Freedom" wasn't particularly helpful, but maybe that's because I've already spent a considerable amount of time researching and considering that topic already.   If you're entering your "Power Years", hoping to rediscover life's purposes, find a balance between work and leisure, find new interests, leave a legacy or any of the latent desires and wishes we hold for our later years, the book is a good primer, will provide plenty of food for thought and ideas, and will kick-start your journey into the "power years". 
 This dryer is really great! It doesn't weigh a lot, which is nice. Also, the LCD is cool looking, however, it is not that useful but still an interesting design feature. I love the quietness of this dryer!!! It still dries my hair quickly without strong blowing. Also, I have noticed that my hair is less frizzy and has a better sheen since using this dryer. In Florida humidity is the enemy to your hair style, but this dryer is excellent at taming frizz for my fine hair. 
 This might not be the greatest Bond movie of all time (Though I'd say it's in the top three), but it most assuredly has the most breath-taking women.  They've never found anyone hotter than Claudine Auger in all the rest of the Bond Movies, and as far as villians go, Luciana Paluzzi, wow, if your going to be killed I guess sleeping with her before wouldn't be the worst way to go.  As for the movie, great story, great action, classic Bond 
 If I was only allowed to take one book to Tibet it would definitely be the Lonely Planet. It has very useful information about the country, the religion, do's and don'ts, etc. I used this book to prepare for my trip and used it in Tibet to get more information on the city I was in or the tempel or monastery I was visiting. Very detailed information about the tempels, the history and what rooms and statues are what. Very useful information about Lhasa and great maps showing not only interesting sites but also the hotels (so you can find your way back) 
 Actually, contrary to what other posters are saying, I think this is the weakest season, and I can see why they gave it a rest after this.  There is less "zing", less creativity, less point and bite than there had been in the first three seasons.  I find Season 3 the most startling overall.  There is brilliance here.  The infamous "Wycked Scepter" sketch is hilarious.  The duelling grocery ads is awesome sketch comedy, all too true and illustrative of its times.  There are other hilarious, brilliant moments scattered in here.  But less than I was expecting.  More than enough to justify the purchase price though.  
 This book is a must read for anyone that will be interviewing others, or will ever be looking for a job themselves.  It provides insight into the standard set of HR questions, that an interviewer ought to know. "What are your strengths"... "Weaknesses"... Why ask these questions unless you know what you are looking for?  This book provides an indepth discussion of these and other questions with sample answers, what you should look for in an answer, and possible follow up questions.  It clarifies the interviewing process.  From a job hunting perspective it helps to hone your skills, and to prepare you for the HR onslaught of seemingly arcane questions 
 After wading through tons of books about current Catholic "troubles", it was refreshing to pick up a book that entertains as well as it informs. Bonavoglia is a skilled craftswoman. Hats off! 
 This is a beautiful story and a very moving one.  St. Dennis, a juggler is fictionalized in this story as Giovanni, a poor boy who loves to entertain people with clever tricks and gambols.  Tomie de Paola is never at a shortage of creating beautiful, bold illustrations and breathes a fresh, literary life into each of the characters.  Givoanni and the beautiful Italy of his times come to life in this book.  Giovanni believes he has escaped the wiles of temptation and often foregoes eating because he feels his soul will vanquish physical hunger.  Over time, Giovanni succumbs to the plaudits and adulation of the crowds while overlooking what his conscience dictates.  Once he has lost his worldly goods and the crowd stops cheering, Giovanni turns to his conscience.  He learns to juggle many bright and beautiful colors and for a higher call than those of a crowd that's been entertained.  Be sure to read this and share it with somebody.  This is a book that will add color, depth and fresh insights.     
 Mark Hitchcock has done a remarkable job in relatively few pages to bring home the reality of the building crisis in the Middle East.  His analysis of the situation there as it relates to prophecies from Ezekiel, Daniel, and others is well researched and convincing.  We would do well to pay close attention as this terminal drama unfolds.  It should also gives some urgency to decision making regarding a relationship with God, our Creator.  We cannot know the precise time of end-time events, but many of the signs are already present.  In any case God is sovereign and we can do nothing to stop or change the things and events that are in God's eternal plan 
 The book that I am reading is called Heaven Eyes. In this book it talks about a young girl named Erin Law and her two friends that live in a orphanage because their parents did not care for them. Their orphanage owner's name is Marlene. When they run away they meet another child named Heaven Eyes that can see everything. Heaven Eyes is what started it all 
 Im British, so I saw Touching Evil way before the US but though I cant seem to find series 2 or 3 on video, I remember quite clearly Touching Evil 2 was the most thrilling, chilling and involved in the characters as any of the series before or after. The first series dealt mostly with Robson Green, but the second delved into Walker and Dingwall's characters and their relatioships with each other, which became really interesting. The end of the second and thrid videos will blow you away 
 My daughter has always been interested in fairy houses since we first watched Kristen's Fairy House.  They are delightful little creations that she would spend hours making in the back yard, or we would go on walks and find natural things for her to use in her designs.  She is now 8, and still very much into creating unique homes for the fairies.  I feel so lucky to see her whimiscal artistic side bloom.  She is even creating seasonal fairy house centerpieces for us to decorate our home with.  I will always treasure these times with her, and the magical memories that we are making.  Sorry if I am long winded.  Getting to the point, this book has GORGEOUS photographs of all kinds of fairy houses, in all seasons.  It is an inspiration to behold.  My daughter and I love to look at the pictures over and over.  The authors brought up a really nice fundraiser that they started by having everyone they knew in their neighborhood make fairy houses.  What an interesting and unusual idea!  Next house tour to raise money for school, can be fairy houses!  This book offers the person that would like to get started making houses, lots of ideas, or is a sweet read for the person that just wants to appreciate little bits of beauty.  A nice addition to Kristen's Fairy House Video/DVD, and sweet memories for family times together 
 Edward Abbey's novels displayed his Sagebrush-style conservationist ideals, and his near-Anarchist sentiments took greatest root here. This is a near-future dystopia tale in which a thinly described economic disaster has forced most people to flee Abbey's beloved desert southwest, leaving just a few hardy naturalist survivors trying to create a non-government lifestyle. Meanwhile the wasted city of Phoenix becomes the base for a big-thinking ex-military man who wants to take control of all of humanity and eliminate dissenters who stand in his way. This novel is overflowing with excellent and thought-provoking political philosophy, especially when it comes to the exact meaning of "freedom" and how that term is actually defined by whoever has power. Unfortunately, this book's politics may be a little outdated, because nowadays I suspect that a western power-hungry demagogue would be the exact ideological opposite of Abbey's villain here (this guy's a socialist). The novel has a few other problems, such as longwinded and tiresome monologues from the characters. Most of the action is rather predictable chase scenes, and the story is capped off by an inconclusive ending, which cries out for a sequel that never appeared. This is a very hard-hitting and thought-provoking novel, but Abbey's basic ideas are better defined elsewhere. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 Francis Fukuyama writes what probably is the clearest prose of any economist since Adam Smith. In this book he provides a fascinating and, I think, accurate anatomy of the origins and principles of neo-conservative thinking. He then uses a neo-conservative perspective to examine such controversial and contentious subjects as the Second Iraqi War and its aftermath, U.S. Foreign Policy in the 21st Century, and the effect of Globalization on the relations of states. In the course of doing this he provides a devastating critique of the current administration's strategic doctrine of preventive war as described in both the National Security Strategy of the United States (NSS) of 2002 and 2006. He points out that preemptive war is vastly different from preventive war and that while the former makes a good deal of sense the latter does not. Fukuyama makes clear that the real U.S. goal of the Second Iraqi War namely to bring about a regime change in Iraq is in accordance with neo-conservative thinking that the nature of regimes do mater. His opposition to the war is based first on his belief that the U.S. initiated the war as a preventive war without a clear understanding of the enemy and second on his neo-conservative distrust of ambitious social engineering projects either in the U.S. or abroad. Less noticed in the uproar over his opposition to the war, is his rather effective argument that the UN confirms the neo-conservative distrust of international institutions and law. He believes, and offers some sound arguments to support this belief, that the UN is largely ineffectual and marginalized by 21st Century Globalization. This book may not make anyone want to become a neo-conservative, but I think it will cause many to recognize that the principles guiding neo-conservatives are not quite as lunatic as the current administration makes them appear. This is a good book full of interesting ideas that are well presented. 
 Author John Grogan offers a heartwarming depiction of his family's life shared with Marley; a big, goofy, loyal and loving dog. At times I found the writing self-indulgent, but overall an enjoyable life story that leaves you heartbroken and completely in love with a 100 pound Labrador retriever you've never met. Living in the West Palm Beach area, I have a sincere appreciation for this book.   
 This is the only album of Jill's I have, but I can recommend it without reserve to any fan of catchy and creative modern pop music. Jill's lyrics are good and her melodies are great - She is also one of the ONLY  "rock stars" in America who still writes and sings topical music 
 This may be Bennis' finest work to date and illustrates the wisdom of his own re-invention and the essence of what's missing in our lives - work and otherwise - leadership we can count on.  A readable text for those who wish to lead and those who wish to follow.  Not only does Bennis write about what leadership is meant to be, he provides some insights on good followship as well.    As a cat owner, the similarities hit home.   I read Managing People in a single sitting - and read it again.  Put it at the top of Business Books to Read 
 Such a nice book! This is a cozy volume, filled with background information on Jane's life, her novels, and the Regency era. Excellent pictures, interesting and well-written text. A perfect book to peruse while you drink a cup of tea on a winter's night. Would make a great gift for any Jane Austen lover 
 I have not yet completed From Beirut to Jerusalem, but I have been fascinated by every word.  Mr. Friedman's intellectual approach to the every-day life, religions and politics of the Middle East is written in an easily understandable, conversational manner.  He asks questions, finds a range of answers from varied sources, and shares his conclusions in a non-judgmental way.  Mr. Friedman's in-depth study of the interplay of religions and politics in the Middle East has clarified many questions I had and has validated some of my thoughts. I better understand what is happening in the Middle East and am rethinking my own political views on today's events. 
 When I first went shopping for a second controller for my GameCube, I admit I was looking for one that matched my Platinum Edition controller. I couldn't find one that wasn't a Wavebird (nothing wrong with a Wavebird - the wireless controller - that I know of, but I was just too cheap to spend the extra $10). So I bought a black controller to match my TV. Now that I think about it, buying a different controller was a smart thing to do. Why didn't I plan on that in the first place? I spent part of the winter battling a cold or the flu at various times, and I can't underestimate the importance of controlling the spread of viruses and bacteria. Having different-colored controllers makes it easier to remember which controller I've been using in between nose-blowing sessions. When a housemate or friend wants to play GameCube as I lay suffering on the other couch, I am able to croak out the words "use the black one today. Trust me."  I also have a phobia against third-party hardware - so it's good of Nintendo (not to mention profitable for Nintendo) to sell spare parts.  The most important things about a controller are: does it fit comfortably in your hand, and are the buttons easy to find and use? The only thing I don't like is the placement of the Z button. The cord is plenty long, and the buttons are responsive enough. I also like that they're color-coded 
 I don't understand why there is only one release by Phutureprimitive.  This entire Tribal Ambient Dub CD is excellent music to kick back and get lost in.  I love the Ambient Dub genre and this music by Phutureprimitive has just enough of its own unique sound to let you know that it's not just more of the same of other simular artists.  However, if you don't have a lot of music like this, than it can seem to become too repetitious and become tiresome rather quickly if you let yourself play this CD too much.  Even I don't care to sit through the entire playback of just the one CD.  But, I have determined that this music from Phutureprimitive should be played within a mix of other Ambient Dub and other various glitch and IDM related electronica.  To just play these 9 songs over and over, end to end, can get dull quickly.  But if you listen to these songs mixed in with about another hundred IDM instrumentals than you will truly appreciate Phutureprimitive's participation in the overall bigger picture of today's electronic instrumentals.    I have this Phutureprimitive CD shuffling amongst others in my 200 CD carrousel.  These tracks by Phutureprimitive are being mixed up with tracks by Autechre, Gescom, Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, Pete Namlook, Biosphere, The Orb, The Higher Intelligence Agency, Sounds From the Ground, Electric Skychurch, Plaid, Boards of Canada, and various other similar artists of which Phutureprimitive belongs with.  I also have these songs and other IDM and Ambient Dub tracks burned onto ATRAC CDR's that is made through the SonicStage program made available only by Sony.  (Check out some of Sony's ATRAC CD players and find out why burning hours of your favorite tunes onto a single CDR is better than just loading an ipod with mp3s)  Burning hard copies is definitely better than just floating your music in a temporary storage unit like an ipod.  (You can make 32 hour CDR's, and as many as you want from all your CD's and mp3s.  How many songs can your single ipod hold?)  Anyway, Kudos to you for discovering this Phutureprimitive CD, but now, explore some of the other artists I've mentioned above.  You will love this new world of sound that you've discovered.  It is more vast than you could ever imagine.   
 I LOVED (and am still playing over and over) this CD.  I don't have any other of her CDs though have always liked her a lot.  It's great hits spanning her career.  Enjoy 
 I know I'm a little late, but what the heck? I felt like writing a review for this game. Final Fantasy X is just a fantastic game. Simple as that. Its extremely deep, has a fantastic story, great characters, great battle system, and it's the perfect length for a RPG (45-55 hours). Not everyone likes Tidus, be he honestly doesn't bother me, and I think he is a interesting character. The rest of the cast is well developed, and they all have interesting personalities that are distinct to this universe. The cast is very memorable, you'll remember them for years to come, and I think that speaks volumes as to how good this game is. Its enhanced by the usual good voice acting that Square is known for, so that doesn't disapoint.  The gameplay is extremely fun, and its actually one of my favorite battle systems. The battle system can make or break a RPG, and this one doesn't disappoint. Its fast paced, so it doesn't get bogged down by long battles. You can also swap characters mid battle, thats a awesome feature. The gameplay is also incredibly deep, I've heard of people literally pouring hundreds of hours into this game. So if thats your thing, I'm sure you've probably already played this game. If for some reason you have not played this game and your into RPG's, don't hesitate to pick this game up, its cheap now, and its one of the best and most balanced RPG's I've ever played 
 What I heard from this cd is really good, its too bad its copy protected, because now I wont buy it.  I like to burn my music to my pc to listen to in a gigantic shuffle.  I learned my lesson with the Stellastarr CD 
 Personally, I didn't get into the details she discusses, but it was a great help motivating me to spend more time with the Lord 
 Book #6 in the In Death Series. In this book you learn so much about Roarke and Sommerset.  The past comes up to haunt Roarke as someone is brutally murdering people from his past.  When the finger points to Sommerset, Eve is forced to put her hatred for him aside and help him for Roarke's sake.  You will be so moved by this story. You will also shed a few tears for Sommerset.  Roarke is a deep guy with many hidden sides, some of them are revealed in this book. Also in this book you meet the fashinably weird and ever loveable E-Detective, Ian McNab.  This is one of the best in the series 
 This book contains translated fascicles from Dogen Zenji's Shobogenzo, a massive and inscrutable philosophical work regarding the nature of life and reality.    Within are some of the most popular, influential, and profound selections of the Shobogenzo regarding zazen meditation practice, which can be everything from somewhat confusing to utterly nonsensical to anyone without a store of background knowledge in Zen Buddhism.    As a consequence, this book is best geared towards those who already have a significant understanding of the language and style of Zen.  It is definitely not for someone who has never encountered Buddhist or Zen thought before.    That said, Dogen Zenji's philosophy is unsurpassed in its depth and influence in Japanese Zen and, to a large extent, Western Zen as well.  The Shobogenzo, written in the 1200's, is still studied and revered today as one of the most brilliant works ever written regarding Buddhist philosophy and practice.  Many Zen teachers have dedicated themselves exclusively to Dogen's thought.  This book, though it does not contain other seminal fascicles such as the Genjokoan, is a great resource to anyone interested in reading not second-hand explanations, but selected translations from one of the most famous teachers and reformers of Zen Buddhism 
 This is one of my 2-year-old's favorite books.  In fact, it was the first book she helped order.  The illustrations are incredibly good, and the book is worth it for that alone.  The text is nothing special, but worth reading 
 I remember watching Hook in the theater and was blown away by its visuals and score.  Like most of John William soundtracks, this one is very thematic.  From playful sound of Pan's theme to the pirate-ish Hook theme, everything flows.  Some of the melody's are on par if not better than John's compositions for Potter.  I recommend buying this because this was made back when Williams was in his prime 
 This product was great. It helped my students and I read and comprehend Macbeth so much better than us trying to read it and comprehend it. The actors voices are great! I think they do a great job being the characters on tape 
 If you haven't read Dinner With Friends, you won't be disappointed. I thoroughly enjoyed it...great plot, great dialogue, great characters, and a bittersweet ending. Definitely a good choice 
 Twenty-eight-year-old Katherine "K.O." O'Connor, adores the holidays on Seattle's Blossom Street. She spends her mornings lounging at the French Cafe, a peppermint mocha and bran muffin seated in front of her, and clicks away on her laptop, creating Christmas letters for the hurried and harried who have no time to write their own. It may seem like a crazy job, but it gives K.O. pleasure knowing that she's helping people out around the holidays, and gives her a chance to get away from her never-ending job hunt and medical transcription wonderland. However, when K.O. finds out that her younger sister has decided to boycott Christmas, and bury Santa under the sleigh, ending all of her lifetime holiday traditions and creating a horrible holiday atmosphere for her twin daughters, all because of a ridiculous child-rearing book written by Dr. Wynn Jeffries, K.O. gets angry. She feels that Dr. Jeffries is a pretentious quack, and finds his theories borderline insane. But when she comes face to face with the doctor of the hour, K.O.'s opinions quickly begin changing. Suddenly she realizes that the man who seems so evil on paper, is actually quite a warm-hearted fellow, who just happens to be quite easy on the eyes and absolutely irresistible. Oddly enough, Wynn finds K.O. just as irresistible. But when the two of them see just how much they disagree with one another, and realize that their personalities and beliefs are, quite frankly, on two different sides of the hemisphere, K.O. and Wynn begin to question whether or not their feelings for one another will make it through the holidays, or be shelved with the decorations come January.  I suppose I should admit that I'm a sucker for holiday romances, especially those that mention quaint cafes, fallen snow, and presents galore. So you can imagine that I was instantly taken with Debbie Macomber's CHRISTMAS LETTERS the moment I saw the cover, and read the inside flap. K.O. is a wonderful character, who instantly captured my heart. Her love for the holidays, determination to find the perfect job in PR, and creativity in starting a business writing Christmas letters are so admirable; while her witty dialogue, oft-times sharp tongue is hilarious, and keeps you laughing as she muddles through one awkward situation after another. Wynn, on the other hand, possesses many of the same traits as K.O., yet allows them to shine through in a less rough and tumble manner. The romance that develops between both him and K.O. is awe-inspiring; while the difficulties in finding a stronghold for their relationship often leave you on the edge of your seat. The appearances of characters such as K.O.'s friend LaVonne, Wynn's father Max, and LaVonne's assortment of cats, are also quite entertaining, yet never overshadow the main characters of the story, and leave room for a possible holiday sequel starring another pair of lovebirds next year...Will warm you from head to toe, and leave you craving more.

 This book was fantastic!  When it comes to motivational books, nothing compares!  Don't hesitate one minute to buy this book...I've attached a recent email I sent to Talane regarding her upcoming book...  Talane:  Remember me from the phone class?   I just read your tip today, and wanted to congratulate you on finishing your book proposal!  I know that makes you feel great...and I KNOW your new book is going to be a winner!   I wanted to share my thoughts on your last book - Coach Yourself to Success.   Talane, I have read MANY (lost count, actually) motivational books over the years.  Books that I thought were really good...and made me feel great after reading them.  But I noticed that the same thing happened after each book.  The feeling the book gave me just sort of "wore off"  after a week or two...and I found that I retained very little a few weeks after the read.  The exception though, was your book.  It had "staying power".  I kept referring to it, and just recently finished reading it again (during and right after our phone class).   I don't know what it was that made your book different from the others.  Maybe the way you pointed out information in numbered tips instead of burying it around meaningless fill sentences.  Its like a reference manual for success!!  Honestly I don't know the secret, but unlike the other books I have read, I will continue to refer to it, reread it, and find new helpful points and hints each time!     Can you capture this "magic" in your new book?  Being an author, maybe you have a term for a book with "staying power"!!     You have helped me so much with your book, phone class, and work materials....maybe someday I can figure out a way to repay you!     I'm sending wonderful thoughts and feelings your way, and wish you much success with your book and future ventures!   Warmest regards,   Vi 
 What can be scarier than being stuck Alone In The Dark with Martin Landau and Jack Palance?  This film attempts to answer that question and does a fine job.  I'm a huge nut for any B horror picture, and it's nice sometimes to actually see some real star power in them.  Granted, Landau and Palance weren't at the highest point in their careers when they did this.  The film has Dwight Schultz, who you may remember as Murdock in the A-Team, as a new therapist at an asylum run by Psychiatrist, Donald Pleasance(who smokes pot in his office).  "The men on the 3rd floor" are the extremely dangerous lunatics who decide to kill Murdock coz they believe he has murdered their former therapist.  There are 4 central killers-First is Marin Landau as "Preacher", a bible quoting psycho.  He's fantastic in this part.  Palance is the paranoid Vietnam vet named Hawkes, who is basically the ringleader.  He doesn't have alot of lines, but since it's Jack Palance, he's wonderfully creepy and convincing.  The third is played by Erland van Lidth as a child molester who is childlike himself.  You may remember Erland as the opera singing Roman Stalker in The Running Man("Cut! Cut! Go to commercial!!").  The fourth is rarely seen and this makes him interesting.  Since his face is always off camera, a name actor isn't necessary.  He's called The Bleeder, and comes off as the most dangerous of the 4 coz he doesn't speak and at one point pre-dates Jason Voorhees by wearing a hockey mask.  Donald Pleasance is awfully nutty and funny in his role of the doctor.  In fact, you start to wonder if he's actually a mental patient himself.  Schultz is decent as the straight man, a far cry from his Murdock character.  This film starts and builds up wonderfully.  It has a fantastic buildup to the point where it becomes like Night Of The Living Dead with Schultz and his family trapped inside their home during a blackout with the band of crazies outside.  Unfortunately the film falls kinda flat here.  With such a good buildup and collection of characters, you expect alot more out of this confrontation than you get.  It's actually kinda boring and not very intense at all.  Despite this shortcoming, the film is well worth watching for the performances. 
 The nations of Europe have been homes to various wars for centuries, until a bunch of the countries got together after the Second World War to create a common economic market, and perhaps prevent any more of these conflicts. It created a form of European identity that has now become the European Union. But the *idea* of Europe, a unified area of diverse cultures that nevertheless falls under the rule of one authority, can be traced back to Charlemagne, the Frankish emperor of the late 8th and early 9th centuries. In his new book, Charlemagne, Derek Wilson examines the emperor's life, but he also examines the myth of Charlemagne through the ages. He looks at how subsequent rulers have used the Charlemagne for their own ends, and how his attempts to conquer and hold together as much of Europe as possible, to have one Europe, has been a precursor to what we have now. Many rulers have tried to duplicate his achievements, but none of them have done so as completely, or perhaps as fairly, as Charlemagne did, even if it was done through conquest.   Charlemagne is a fairly short book, but it does pack a lot of information into it. Wilson begins by giving a short history of Europe up until the time of Charlemagne's birth, including an interesting set of maps, one of which is the European Economic Community in 1957 and one that is the extent of Charlemagne's empire in 814. The two look very similar, with only the southern part of Italy not being included in Charlemagne's area. Food for thought, but Wilson goes on to say that, while Charlemagne's story demonstrates this desire for unity, it is basically a story, full of military actions, barbarian invasions, and political/religious intrigue. His father and grandfather began all of this, but it was Charlemagne's force of personality that really made it work. This introduction is a good one, setting the scene in a very interesting manner but never losing sight of the fact that many stories have been added to Charlemagne's over the years to support what somebody wants to do. The whole thing is a story, and we don't have a lot of primary sources about his life. Those we do have could very well be biased, as the most prominent biography of the time was written during the reign of one of Charlemagne's sons, and it really makes the son look good. Contemporary biographies seem to gloss over military defeats, with scarcely a mention of the disastrous foray into Moslem Spain, for example.   What's even more interesting is that a full third of the book doesn't talk about Charlemagne himself, but about how his image has carried on through the years since his death. We see the beginnings of it as the Empire falls apart shortly after his death, as his sons just don't have the forcefulness that their father had. The Empire does survive through one of his son's reign, but it doesn't survive for long. Wilson uses this to show how much the idea of Europe was a personal thing at the time, with the various warring factions that were under one umbrella starting to feel the chafe as Charlemagne's personal influence waned with his death. Wilson then proceeds to give us a brief history of Europe up to the modern day, placing the legend of Charlemagne within that context, from the rise of the Holy Roman Empire through the years until its final death. Wilson details the fall of remains of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, after a long period where it survived basically in name only, as well as how Napoleon (and even Hitler) used the legend of Charlemagne to further their own ends. I found this part of the book fascinating as I was fairly unfamiliar with him and his influence, despite knowing the basics about him being the first emperor of western Europe. One interesting bit of history that I did not know is that Charlemagne divided his empire into three pieces for his three sons. One basically takes the shape of France, one the shape of Germany (at least western Germany), and there's a piece in the middle that encompasses the land which Germany and France have been fighting over for centuries.   It's intriguing things like this which makes Charlemagne a great read. Wilson does a deft job giving us Charlemagne's history too, both of the man as he's growing up and becoming king, how he wrests control of the entirety of his father's kingdom from his brother, as well as his time as Emperor, when Pope Leo III crowned him (though the details of this crowning, as well as the impetus for it, remain obscured by history) Emperor of the West and as he expanded his lands. Wilson gives us as much detail as probably exists about Charlemagne's life and times, emphasizing how religious he was and how learned (he could read, but he couldn't write, and he loved scholarly discussions to be carried out over dinner). He doesn't gloss over the bad parts, however, even saying that, in modern times, Charlemagne would be considered a tyrant. But he points out that many of the cultural traditions in the lands that he conquered were allowed to remain, though he admits this perhaps was because of the difficulty in governing far-away provinces.   What I found most interesting and well-presented about this section, however, is how Wilson gives us a sense of the time around Charlemagne. The political struggles between the two remaining parts of the Roman Empire, as well as the religious ones (even giving a brief accounting of the controversy in Constantinople over the use of iconography in Christian practices) were simply fascinating. This, combined with the examination of Charlemagne's legacy (as well as his legend) makes Charlemagne a wonderful read for anybody interested in the history of the Middle Ages. It may even be of interest to those looking for the history of European unity. It all started right here, even if it was by the sword. And the idea, though sometimes submerged, has never truly died.

 Robert Louis Stevenson (1850 - 1894) was a remarkable author from the Victorian Era. He has left us at least two masterpieces: "The Treasure Island" (1883) and "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (1886) and some other good novels such as "The Black Arrow" (1888).  It is amazing how writers and poets are able, thru intuition, to anticipate events or discoveries. When this book was first published, Sigmund Freud was studying with Charcot and not so many years later will produce his theoretic corpus of the human psyche. At some points the present story touches Freud's conceptualizations.   Dr. Jekyll suspect evil burdens every human soul, being an obstacle in its way to goodness. So he investigates and produces a drug that "liberates" the evil spirit and doing so he intend to be relived of it. But Evil starts to grow each time more powerful and Mr. Hyde end cornering Dr. Jekyll into impotence and fear.  This story has captivated the public's imagination for more than a hundred years. Movies, comics and theater pieces had evolved from it. His tortured dual character is now a well known icon as Stoker's Dracula or Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Even if you know more or less the story and its ending, reading this very short book is a powerful adventure. A Classic you shouldn't let pass by unheeded!  Reviewed by Max Yofre. 
 I had taken up karate with my son, who is now a black belt, and struggled on and off to stick with it. I loved the discipline and workout that karate gave me but it seemed like I was always getting injured or working twice as hard to keep up with class. My wife bought me this book for my birthday and it's been a great help in getting me back to class on a regular basis. I started out doing some of the exercises at home first so I could get in better shape. Once I felt more confident in my flexibility and speed, I started going to class again and saw a big change in my ability to keep up with the younger guys and gals. Sang H. Kim includes a lot of little tips and tricks to train smarter and not waste precious time and energy. I especially like his positive "can-do" attitude. I'm looking forward to getting my black belt and joining my son in black belt classes in the not too distant future.  
 I got this album on vinyl, and on the first spin I was like "okay, well this is good" but didnt listen to it again for quite a while. The next time I heard it, as if by some delayed reaction, I thought "damn, this is AWESOME!". Jeff's guitar playing has the perfect blend of technique/feel/phrasing, but you expect that on even the weakest Jeff Beck album (not that any of his albums could be described as "weak"), brilliant playing is a given. But here, the leads, the melodies and the backing musicians are just outrageous! Its hard to pick favourite tracks, but I really like "Too Much To Lose", "Star Cycle", "The Pump"... Actually, they're all pretty great! This album is definetly up the the standard of "Blow By Blow" or "Wired", in my opinion at least 
 This simple little gadget turns out to be one of the most useful kitchen utensils you can own. Running off two AA batteries, the powerful small motor is housed in a durable and comfortably sized handle. In operation, the replaceable nylon whisk (two are included) expands to the diameter of the container. The unit quickly and completely dissolves any drink powder or finely ground ingredient into a hot or cold liquid. It cleans with a simple rinse. I use it most often for individual servings of hot cocoa, but it works just as well for psyllium, vitamin preparations or sweeteners. Incidentally, Badger uses the same motor housing, with a metal shaft and head, for its airbrush Paint Mixer--a real time saver for hobbyists. A rugged and completely functional small appliance. Once you've used it, it becomes indispensable. 
 This book has been sitting on my bookshelf for a while because I passed it over for other newer books... How sorry I am I waited this long! This book is so good... the stories about the different dogs are heartwarming, and heartwrenching...they are filled with almost any dog immaginable and are a delight to read especially for dog lovers. I can't recommend this book enough.. 
 I love this CD. It is like actually doing a mat class in my house. The pacing is great. The exercises and their order are exactly what I get in my classical Pilates mat classes. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I want a few MORE mat classes. At this point I do the same 22 minute workout every day. I think it would be fairly easy to put a couple more on the CD with varying exercises. I am an intermediate Pilates student, and I feel that I need more workout than this CD offers. I'd like to try some more exercises at home, but I prefer to have a guide. However, having this straightforward class to do at home has been great! I am now doing Pilates every day 
 Gretchen writes with a wonderful "in your face style" that I found refreshing. The title of the book is not only an author's "Keyword Dream" but the book answers the how to questions implied in each of those words. This is not fluff reading. If you are easily offended by the way the world really is out there, read another book. If you want to see life in the fast lane, here it is. This book is a winner. Kevin Hogan, .. 
 I am only a part-time amateur philosopher with a scientific/technical backgound but I still found it very refreshing to come across a book like this. Ethics / morality is something that nearly everyone feels strongly about but few consider objectively 
 Clark Ashton Smith is a writer most similar to Poe, Lovecraft, and Dunsany -- and yet, like each of them, he is also unique.  Not afraid to be gloomy, his work is poetic, visual, both dreamlike and nightmarish.  His  stories are short, as many were in the pulp era -- but I find the fast pacing a welcome contrast to long-winded styles of other eras.  He gets right to the point, with the artistic economy found only in poets. 
 Not your typical Stones record, but it's still amazing.  Lots of poppy stuff with pretty lyrics done very well.  "I'd Much Rather Be With the Boys" is a classic.  ESSENTIAL! 
 The central figure in this volume is the Baron de Charlus. Everybody else seems to me to be relative to him. His homosexiality is a passion that is not only sexual, but also intellectual and seems to run parallel to the disintegration of this society he loves so much. I never have read a believable description of a character of such arrogance and vanity, yet posessed of such human frailty. A very disquietening classic 
 My step father use to blast this group twenty-four seven. One thing I always liked about the Isley Brothers sound (which is missing in today's so-called music), they had a rock and funk appeal.  For example the cut "Livin In The Life" the intro just drops this funky bass on you like DAMN!!!  I have to reply that again!!!  Then the precussion guitar kicks off with the beat just rockin and rollin away, I mean this was a baddass jam.    But I always liked this rare up tempo track (was never played on the radio) by the Isley Brothers, which was the b-side to the  12 inch version of "I Want To Be With You" called "Rockin with Fire."  So question people, WHICH ALBUM (OOPS! CD NOW) CAN I FIND THIS OTHER BADDASS RARE TRACK BY THEM?  HELP!!!!  
 While American democracy has changed significantly over the past couple centuries since de Toqueville wrote this, his chapters on citizenship and governance are still a must-read for anyone interested in the workings of democratic government. His insight was exceptional, so like Shakespeare, much of this work is a timeless analysis of human nature 
 I have read every one of Coulter's books and more romance than I could ever care to count, and this ranks up there as one of my all time favorites of any romance and most fiction books. North fascinated me from the time that he was introduced in Wyndham. I waited impatiently for his story, and I was not disappointed. He is the epitome of the brooding, tortured romantic hero, much in the spirit of Rochester and Heathcliff, but without the violent Gothic tendencies. His brooding is partly by choice, partly hereditary and he does his best to turn it into something silly so that the melancholy does not consume him the way it did his father and grandfather. Caroline is a heroine who, though sometimes a little goofy, is determined and strong and will do whatever it takes to get what she wants. In this case, she wants North, and who can blame her? The secondary characters are typical of Coulter's creations in that they are wonderfully fun and witty. Some of the great moments o!f the book occur during the interactions between North's misogynistic household and Caroline's pregnant charges. The story is basically about a man struggling desperately not to become like those who came before him, a plot that is by no means uncommon, but in Coulter's capable hands, the characters jump out and take on a life of their own, making this story, and specifically its hero, insurpassable. If only we all had a man like North in our life. The world would definitely be a happier place for me 
 Being a Ruth Gordon fan, this is truly one of my all time favorite comedies.  It's Ruth at her very best.  Truly a "don't miss. 
 On one level, this novel is a whodunnit - we are following the trial of a fisherman accused of killing another fisherman. But since one is Japanese-American and the other white, the book is also an examination of racial bigotry and hatred.  It is set in the American North-West among a strawberry growing and fishing community torn apart by WWII and the internment of Japanese-Americans.  There is a love story, a vivd and visceral description of being a soldier in WWII, and the narrator's slow decline into loneliness and professional failure.  But the book scores highest when is shows us how fear turns to mistrust and mistrust to injustice and hatred, all without becoming preachy 
 I used this book (actually the 3rd edition) in preparing for my comprehensive exams for my master's degree. The title is descriptive. The book is short excerpts of key writings on the organization theory. The selection of readings is appropriate. The only complaint I have is that sometimes I wished I had the complete book in question! On the other hand, some of this stuff is really dry. If you are pursuing the field in an academic way, this is a valuable book.  But I can't imagine reading it for enjoyment or idle curioisity 
 For a variety of reasons I thought it might be a good idea to pull my old copy of The Best and the Brightest from the bookshelf, dust it off and re-read it. A few things I had forgotten since reading this book in college. This is a big book, not only in length but also in breadth and scope, tracking U.S. foreign policy back to "losing" China to communism, the Korean Conflict, and the French Indo-China War -all leading to the first tentative steps of US involvement in Southeast Asia to finally the escalation of the 1960's. I was also surprised by the underlying contempt, (too strong a word?), the author had for the continuing set of decisions, (and decision makers), made to solve the Vietnam "problem" while only further compounding it. On my re-reading I was struck by the fact that many of the issues addressed in this book, (national security interests and intelligence, military technology, insurgency, imposed democracy, nationalism, leadership qualities) are still extremely relevant in today's world and in some cases still unresolved. This book was also a not so gentle reminder of what a capable journalist can synthesize during turbulent times 
 Brad Warner - iconoclast or zen punk?  I'm not sure I can discern the difference.  This is a great book.  It borrows the best of all the 'spiritual' texts which paraphrase the Buddha's "Be a light unto yourselves" wisdom.  Question everything - EVERYTHING!  If the four noble truths turn out wrong, accept it and  move on, but keep questioning!  First rate 
 This is one neat album.  Almost all of the tracks are great 
 You will find 75 "hacks"in Mind Performance Hacks. These tips can be use to take your memory, focus, and concentration to a new level.  Some are complex and require some practice, like #5 - Use the Major System.  This is a series of mnemonics that you can use to help remember large numbers of related and unrelated items.  There are also alternatives to that system, such as the Dominic System (#6).  Either way, you may find that something like this can help you dramatically improve your "remember-y".  Other hacks are ways to improve your cognitive efectiveness by changing your lifestyle, such as #69 - Don't Neglect the Obvious: Sleep, Nutrition, and Exercise and #71 - Navigate around the Post-Lunch Dip.  Simple ways you can avoid mental pitfalls.  I also enjoyed #27 - Play Mind Music.  I finally understand why I find that I can't listen to a podcast and program at the same time.  Good stuff, and not too pricey... 
 Like other Streetwise maps, the Paris map is a useful tool to have with you on a visit to the "City of Lights."  The map is clear, easy to use and convenient.  It folds into a size that is easily placed in your pants pocket.  The streets and sites are well marked and it is easy to locate where you are, where you want to go and how to get there.  In combination with the Artwise map, it can be used to make your time in Paris an easy and enjoyable stay 
 It's a great story that gives you amazing insight into the house of Gucci...loved it!  Now I have countless anecdotes to go along with my handbags 
 I was kind of scared to buy this album because when you have an artist that has been off the scene for as long as C.L. has you have to wonder if he still has the "magic" that he had back in the day. American Me minus Pete Rock is a classic from beginning to end. C.L's lyrics and delivery are amazing, maybe even better than he was before. C.L. doesn't stop with the lyrics, the production on the album is very nice also. There are some old school funk beats and samples. I am totally satisfied with this purchase and I recommend this album to everyone who know and loves hip hop 
  I am totally satisfied with this carseat. It was a bit tricky getting it installed in the car (I recommend reading the instructions, and having an extra set of hands to help you install it) but all carseats can be a bit tricky.    My 7 month old son loves this carseat because it sits higher up than his first seat and he can see outside (this makes our road trips MUCH more pleasant).    There are lots of places for you to adjust the straps, buckle, and headrest so you can really make the seat fit your baby.  I am not sure how well it would work for a newborn because it doesn't recline as far as carseats that are only rear-facing, and it might make it harder for your little one to take naps and keep his head in a comfortable position. (Plus, it is SO nice to have a carseat with a detachable base for a brand new baby so you don't have to wake them up when they are sleeping).  But if you only want one carseat, I am sure a neck support pillow in the carseat would work great for newborns.  My favorite feature of this carseat is that I won't have to keep buying more carseats (and then find a place to store the old ones) until my son is old enough to ride without one 
 Heather Cox is the wo-man.  All of the problems are worked out in the goriest of detail, leaving nothing to the imagination.  Not only are the problems fully worked, but additional justification and reasoning is given, making this a great supplement to the main text, especially in courses where the professor assigns a significant amount of book problems 
 His "tanorexic" sister, his tribulations in Paris, his stint as a professor- this book is so funny. Of course, some essays were just so-so (as in, didn't make me cry laughing), but it's only because he sets the bar so high for himself with his scathing wit. 
 Standing in the shadow of an established genius can be a difficult thing. Even more, coming into contact with someone that expects you to measure up to or even surpass said genius can also be difficult if not daunting. While specific examples of this motif escape me right now, it has been used countless times in literature and film to produce some incredibly memorable characters and storylines. And it's justifiably so: in some ways, standing in the shadow of the established sort of dooms the reception of some works by default. (In my opinion, the most recent and glaring of this would be Neutral Milk Hotel's excellent On Avery Island.) However, sometimes it is wise to forget that the established exists to judge the music on its own merits. Other times, however, the two can be compared to reveal that the subordinate has its own eccentricities/traits that sets it completely apart for its "big cousin," if you will. I shall be going the comparative route.   De Capo's "big brother" is obviously Love's widely acclaimed magnum opus Forever Changes. It's known for utilizing grandiose Sgt. Pepperesque orchestration to accompany and ultimately illuminate Lee's tender orchestrations. However, to many modern ears that I encounter (those detached from the world of critics, I mean) it sounds "dated" or "old fashioned." This makes sense to me since while Forever Changes is a GREAT album, the session musicians sound fairly separated from the band. This is okay since it still works great for the album. However, with De Capo, we simply have two extra musicians. These musicians bring classically-trained harpsichord, jazzy saxophone and sparse/hip organ playing into the mix. As a result, the extra musicians sound more organic; they actually sound as if they are a PART of the music. As a result, the songs--at their very base--are given much more dimension and a sort of (for rock music, anyway) inexplicable charm/class.   Whether it's the harpsichord-reinforced screamer rock of "Stephanie Knows Who," the riff driven madness of "Seven & Seven Is" or the semi-baroque "The Castle," a listener quickly becomes aware that you're listen to music written by someone whose musical knowledge extends beyond doo-wop and mere psychedelics. (Though the music most certainly isn't devoid of these influences.) You hear showtunes, classical music and jazz all mixed into the cauldron and dispensed through a healthy medium of great pop music. Even with Revolution, while it may not be a piece of clever songwriting, it still gives the musicians to showcase the musical virtuosity that wouldn't readily be apparent in the songs they play. And finally, there's my personal favorite "Que Vida," which never fails to make me feel as if I'm spiraling through the star-filled heavens. (Considering the amount of drugs taken during the writing of these songs, I wouldn't be surprised if Lee were feeling the same thing.)   All in all, this is an amazingly creative psychedelic masterpiece that is frequently overlooked thanks to its successor. I really do not have to say much about the aftermath since the rest, as they say, is history.   R.I.P Arthur Le 
 This is one of the best books out there for academics who need help getting themselves to write.  I'm a clinical psychologist who coaches faculty, post-docs and grad students, and this is one of the first books I recommend.  Almost all of Boice's prolific body of work is useful - and his suggestions, both in books and journal articles, are backed up by research - this makes his contributions unique in the genre of self-help books for academics 
 ... I was a bit perplexed to discover accusations of "bias" [by others]. What were people expecting? The evening news? Journalism? Collings approaches his subject - the evolution of modern art and the context of contemporary British artists - from an informed, but highly personal point of view. Pretty much like Clement Greenburg or Robert Hughes or any of the other hundreds of critics with a case to make... Collings's writing is witty, erudite and can, in the turn of one sentence or a single carefully chosen word, create an entirely new way of looking at familiar art works. Not everyone is going to agree that Basquiat is great or that certain UK artists aren't very good - but what the hell - it's just one man's opinion. In light of the orthodox, conservative and sometimes downright reactionary points of view put forward by tv art critics and book authors, Collings is a fresh voice with something to say. That's very rare in any writer and, in the art world, as rare as genius itself 
 if you like this type of music...I do so I would buy agai 
 I have known Bob Collins for several years. He has proven to be an intelligent, trustworthy, patriot of our nation with his associates, Richard Doty and Timothy Cooper.  This book "Exempt from Disclosure", second edition, has further substantiated his initial book by the same title with astounding new revelations. Especially those revealing the exchange of earthlings for aliens from other planetary systems. YES, our stellar exchange "students" for THEIR stellar exchange  "students",  called, EBE-1 and 2 from a star, named Zeta Reticuli I & II.  What allows me to endorse this book?? I have been deeply involved with UFO's, aliens sighting events since 1947. As the former Director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena Unit-3 at Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, during my career, 1958 to 1992. With this book, you will learn what newspapers are NOT permitted to print - - the TRUTH!!  Clark C. McClelland, former ScO, (Ground Test Astronaut) Space Shuttle Fleet, KSC, Florida  
 I loved reading this trilogy. It beautifully creates three worlds and an abundance of complex peoples. In the fantasy genre, authors have a tendency to re-create stories similar to others; in this trio of books it constantly surprises you with its twists and turns. I loved these books and will continue to buy anything Mrs. Berg publishes. 
 I had an aching back for about five years, mostly in my lower back and sometines in my mid and upper back. I made the usual rounds between doctors, specialists, chiropractors, accupuncturists, and so on. The pain was always there, sometimes better sometimes worse. I used to wake up in pain and stiff most mornings.  One day I read an article about Dr. Sarno's work and decided to persue it further. I read his books and noticed some improvement in my pain and stiffness. But for whatever reason, I just could not get rid of the pain.  Then I read Amir's book. I just made so much more sense to read the effectiveness of Sarno's method witin the context of his recovery. Just reading his story gave me a lot of hope. I tried his recovery plan and was amazed how quickly it worked. I never thought eating ice cream could cure my back.  Now 9 weeks later, I am almost completely free of pain and very happy. I know the reviews for Sarno and Amir books are mixed, but it worked for me and I if you like ice cream, you should definitely try it.  
 College essays are so important. They allow you to frame your application, and tie all your disparate achievements together to form a coherent application. I would go so far as to say that the first edition of this book single-handedly got me into Harvard. And the second edition is even better! There are new essays, a more diverse range, and the commentary on the essays is lengthier and more insightful. I especially liked the new essay by Harrison Greenbaum about magic. A must read for anybody who is applying to a competitive college 
 In addition to this book being a "labor of love", Steve Carp leaves no stone unturned regarding the history of the team.  Chock full of facts and statistics, as well as personal observation, it is easy to read and comprehend even if one is not a fan of the team, or of the sport 
 Fascinating look into a little-known event in Major League Baseball. Extraordinary detail. The characterization of Carl Mays and Ray Chapman is outstanding 
 The only knock on it is that it needs more dampening, but that has been covered ad nauseum in other reviews and magazine articles.  I took photos of the moon with this lens that were just stunning 
 The Metabolism Advantage is a great reminder of what WE ALL should be doing to maximize our nutritional intakes.  However, not only nutrition is covered.  Excellent workout routines are provided that will challenge exercisers at every level.    When you combine the amount of research Dr. Berardi compiled for this book, along with the tremendous amount of "real life" experience he has, you can't go wrong.  I highly recommend this book for any consumer or professional interested in learning more about how to optimize metabolism in the human body 
 As I've stated many times before, there was three types of music I listened to growing up. Innovative British, pop American and unique Canadian. Unique didn't mean it was better but your perspective was different depending on which part of North America you were from. We had cancon (Canadian content) rules for radio meaning that a certain amount of airplay had to be devoted to Canadian talent. Unfortunately most of this talent couldn't or didn't break into the lucrative American market and its too bad as a lot of it was very good. Lighthouse "One Fine Morning" was a smash hit here along with the likes of "Pretty Lady, Take it Slow, I Just Wanna be Your Friend, Hats Off to the Stranger,1849" etc. etc. etc. The same goes for Ottawa's Five Man Electrical Band with "Signs" and " Absolutely Right" also responsible for tunes such as "Werewolf, We're a Stranger Here, Julianna, Hello Melinda Goodbye" etc. etc. etc. The Stampeders "Sweet City Woman" followed with "Carry me, Devil You, Wild Eyes, Runnin' Wild, Oh my Lady" etc. etc. etc. The Buoy's "Timothy" was admittedly a strange little ditty but it got past the censors of the time and was a catchy tune. Ex Smith member Gayle McCormick's "It's a Crying Shame" was also a big hit here as well as its flip side "If Only You Believe" which was also recorded by The Free Movement. Check out some of the groups I've mentioned. You may be pleasantly surprised. Enjoy 
 This book was such a ride!  Since I grew up watching Agent 99 on Get Smart, as a kid, reading her book felt very intimate.  I just kept thinking, "NOT AGENT 99!," as I read about the ups and downs in her personal and love life.  Yet, it isn't a celebrity expose.  Her words are meant to inspire and go beyond the shallow genre of gossip.  You really do forget that this woman was a television icon because she is very down to earth and generous in spirit.  As many other readers here have shared, I could not put this book down.  I found it inspiring and helpful.  Excellent!! 
 I like the book, it gives very clear meaning so it is easy to understand.  The price for the book is just right for a college student 
 Scott, has done it again! Amazingly, he has told a taut, plausible tale with memorable characters in a universe he created 2 decades ago. He also tied up many plot lines, as well as leaving opportunities for continued dreaming of what happens next. Excellent and you will enjoy this conclusion to the Shadow series 
 The good: This book is quite well written.  Unlike most poker books, there is little jargon, which would make it quite valuable for a beginner.  Navarro's ideas are laid out in a very clear manner.  As other reviewers have stated, Navarro's insights are great and will help your poker game (as it has helped mine.)  The bad: It may just have been my expectations, but I was hoping for some activities designed to put the observation techniques into practice.  I also would have liked to have seen some clearer poker situations, like in Dan Harrington's books.  The visual examples provided in this book are all pictures of Navarro (except for a few of a woman to point out some gender specific tells.)  The only problem with this if we are to put this information into practice, we need to be used to looking for them on different people.  None of my problems with this book outweigh the positives.  I would like to see Navarro come out with a companion DVD.  This is a must-read, and goes well with Caro's Book of Tells 
 I bought it because I love the song "Ne me quitte pas" but I got a pleasant surprise when I listened to it. Even though most of the romantic songs are very old, they are the best and the way these singers interpret them makes you get a nostalgic feeling even for those folks that do not speak spanish. Buy this CD you won't be dissappointed 
 Charles H. Whedbee really captures the spirit of good storytelling in this  book. I really enjoy going to the Outer Banks, and his books create a  romantic mood to the lore and legends of such a wonderful place.  Any book  by Mr. Whedbee is a book worth reading 
 Nothin to say but Wiggle your hips, now shake,shake,shake.Great tracks funky rhythms,another must have to your collection.  
 I'm sure many will draw comparisons between this book and Tracy Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, which I liked less.  Vreeland cleverly tells her story from present to past and makes the captivating girl in the painting the central character in her tale.  I also loved her evocative descriptions of the Dutch landscape 
 I saw this movie in the late '60's when it was made. I liked it then. I had not seen it since, but have been contemplating attitudes toward money lately and remembered the movie. It is interesting how 36 years (or so) can change one's perspective. Although the movie did not change (obviously), my attitude toward money has changed. I still have a certain amount of disrespect for money and for selling the days of my life for money. I still believe that people are much more greedy than they need to be. All of these things stayed the same, both in the movie (of course) and in my mind. I now have enough money to meet my basic needs and even a few "wants" that are not needs. When I first saw the movie, I was on the outside, not always knowing if I would have enough to secure basic needs. Either way, this movie is a biting satire and can allow one to step far enough from the current attitudes toward money that one might have and start to explore them from a different perspective.   Even if the viewer does not want to have that deep of an experience while watching a movie, it is interesting to see how many well known people, both living and (now) dead are in one movie; sometimes just walking through in the background, sometimes with important parts.   This movie is part of the culture and should not be missed 
 I originally got this book to skim through before giving it to a loved one who is going through a difficult time. I looked at several books written by people with a bunch of letters after their names, but ultimately selected this one since I was familiar with Dave Pelzer's childhood story. If HE can enjoy a happy, fulfilled life after everything he's been through, I figure, so can ANYONE with breath left in their body!  There are a few heart-wrenching stories of the tortures he endured as a child, but mostly, Dave encourages us to make peace with the past (and tells us HOW!), and advises us to make the most of each day, each situation, and even each hardship-using each event as a stepping stone toward the fulfillment we all seek.   Sure, there's a little rhetoric here and there in the book, but Dave is humble and admits he's not a professional writer or counselor-just a regular guy who's been there and done that. Personally, that makes me believe him even more than someone who paid their way through medical school to get all those letters behind their name.  I find his writing style to be down-to-earth, comforting, and sincere-and I could relate to more than a few of the example situations he presents in the book.  Even though I was looking for this as a help for someone else, I was finding myself highly interested, enriched, and feeling more positive about the few grim situations in my otherwise happy life! And I do think it could be a source of positive influence for anyone. No, he doesn't have all the answers-but he doesn't claim to! But he definitely steers us in the right logical direction with realistic ways to improve our situations every day.  Dave Pelzer is a courageous, triumphant man who deserves every happiness life has to offer, and we should all be glad he is so willing to share his "secrets" with all of us. May God Bless him 
 I loved this book. It was interesting to go into the "office" of Shelley and see all her quirky clients. The best part of this book is how it's short and sweet. It doesn't drag on and on and the resolution of her dilemmas are solved quickly. It never got boring for me 
 When listening to this C.D., you can just sense the great joy and fun they had recording it.  It is the kind of C.D. you can't help but feel happy and wanna get up and dance.  Especially with great tracks like the remake of John denver's country road. (my personal favorite)  I am also partial to Pomp and Pride.  Anyone who likes Reggae/ska will probably love this c.d.  Toots and the Maytails were a very important part in early Reggae music in the 60's and 70's It is also a great starter disc for people who have interest in reggae music.  It is truely a classic that stands alon 
 I really enjoyed the watching the movie for it's scene with the Dragon and I thought the movie was interesting the whole time.  I've watched it several times since I purchased it 
 We had ordered this product as a retirment present for a co-worker who was leaving in about a week so we even had Fed Ex shipping.  The product kept showing up as in Order Status & never updated until almost a week later when it was delivered.  Product arrived in excellent condition but we were wondering if it was ever shipped...Amazon or Retailer needs to update shipping info instead of leaving product showing Order status & not shipped 
 There are few finer story tellers than Plimpton.  This is one of his best  and funniest works.  Some remarkable stories 
 We've had several other brands of espresso makers before and this one is the best so far.  The espresso is wonderful and being able to use the pods sure saves a lot of time.  The frothing arm really makes frothing effortless, much easier than any other machine we've had. The only problem with it that we've noticed is the frothing arm should be higher up on the machine because it is impossible to get a mug with milk under it, unless it is moved to the edge of the counter.  It took a few tries to figure everything out, but it is a great machine  Other than the one problem we've noticed it works perfectly and has saved us a bunch on buying lattes 
 This movie was a critical flop at the time of its release, but history has been kinder.  Crawford gives one of her best peformances as a bawdy prostitute who falls under the spell of a zealous preacher.  Moody, frighteningly believable in spite of the period mannerisms, this ranks as one of the best films of its era and a great study in filmmaking, too.  Surpasses even the short novel by Somerset Maugham 
 Contrary to some reviewers, I felt the background of American atrocities added depth and understanding to the book. Does it make excuses for what the Japanese did? Absolutely not. Does it provide a framework for understanding the thinking of the people of that era? Yes. Just understanding the concept of "bringing civilization to the world" in both American and Japanese eyes is important. All too often we put ourselves on a the golden throne and never want to admit that we have been cruel to those we dominated. This book provides a very personal look at a few young men that lived and died for their country. It also provides graphic detail about the attrociites of war waged by a society ruled by fear of reprisal. A real eye-opener 
 One of my favorite cd's. Of the 3 "new" series cd's, season 2 is the best so far.   I can't wait for the release of Season 3. 
 Dr. Nunn's marvelous retrospective picks up where Guido Majno's seminal "The Healing Hand: Man and Wound in the Ancient World" leaves off with regard to ancient Egyptian medicine.  The book is well referenced and easy to understand, and illustrated with 90 photographs and line drawings in addition to transliteration tables of hieroglyphic terms (which leads one to wonder if comments on a lack of "pictures" were made by someone who actually bothered to read the book).  Highly recommended to the student of ancient medicine, the specialist of ancient occult and herbal practices related to healing, or those who study ancient Egypt 
 ON TIME is Grand Funk Railroad's debut, and it's a monster. The opener, "Are You Ready", could be seen as a call for self-assertion, and "Time Machine" is a great little single. GFR would make even better albums, but ON TIME is a great debut 
 I strongly recommend new parents thoughtfully consider Baby Wise in developing your parenting style.  Now parents of a 5-month old, we used parent directed feeding (PDF from Baby Wise) from the day we left the hospital and have been pleased with the results. BabyWise claims that that the PDF method will often result in happy, well adjusted, satisfied, children that are pleasant to be around. We have found this to be the case.  My one gripe with the book is the lack of scientific, empirical studies on the PDF parenting style. Unfortunately, the book (and I) can only give anecdotal evidence of the merits of PDF based on personal experiences.   Born in the 25th percentile weight/height, our little one was on a predictable schedule within a week, consistently sleeping (7 hours) through the night within 7 weeks and has been sleeping 11 hours at night since 12 weeks. When in public, we often get comments that our baby "is so happy" and "content." We go out to eat several times a week - without more than smiles and laughs (we have only left a restaurant once - but were able to do so before he cried). We house-hunted 9 hours a day for a week (in and out of the car 10-15 times) and our real estate agent never heard the baby cry - no pacifier. We have been on five multi-hour plane trips without any more than a giggle and coo. One friend was reluctant to hold our baby because she said that "babies always cry when I hold them." Our little one was pleasant and smiley. Does our baby ever cry? Of course! He cries at least one time every day (usually during his predictable "fussy time" - a 45 minute stretch before bedtime.) When he does cry, diagnosing the problem is pretty simple with PDF (I'll let you read the book to find out how) - and I still haven't figured out how to differentiate types of crys as the hospital suggested. Just as indicated in Baby Wise, after being put to bed at 9pm, our little one wakes up at about 6:30am singing and cooing and goes back to sleep within 30 minutes. At 7:45am, he wakes up again and greets us with a smile when we walk in the room. Our baby gained weight and height predictably throughout his first few months, moving into the 50th percentile weight/height at his last visit.  My sister and several of our friends have used Baby Wise with similar results.   Is Baby Wise for everyone? - Probably not. If you enjoy structure and organization and are accustomed to being on a regular schedule yourself, your parenting style will probably mesh nicely with Baby Wise. If you consider yourself a free spirit who enjoys responding to the unpredictability that life often brings, then you will probably find Baby Wise to be restrictive to your parenting style. In fact, we have friends who did not use Baby Wise and ended up with happy, pleasant children as well.  Does Baby Wise CAUSE babies to be pleasant and happy? I don't know, but it did work for us and I can only imagine how difficult parenthood would be for us without the principles explained in the book.  
 We got this for our 8-year old boys and loved the designs and the stained glass effect of the colored pictures on the windows.  My 10-year old boy liked them too so we went through the book in just a few months and now need to order another Ruth Heller coloring book 
 Self-described Colorado "wild man" Ken Wright's second book, "Why I'm Against It All," is a glowing example of why small publishers are increasingly essential in these hard-sell times of corporate media conglomerations interested only in fast profit. "Why" is a rare gem of a book that's far more informed, insightful, entertaining and important than most of what comes out of the New York "big house" profit mills these sickly days. As a long-time Rocky Mountain, small-town, edge dweller--ski bum, river guide, desert rat, bus driver, construction worker, teacher, newspaper columnist, environmental and social activist and more--Wright has his thumb on the political, cultural and spiritual life of small Rocky Mountain tourist towns like no other writer I know. While heavily influenced by Edward Abbey, Wright's "rants" are his own, in no way an imitation of anyone else. And best of all, like Abbey, Ken Wright has the sense of humor essential to make his ranting not only bearable, but brilliant. If New York had any true book sense or any social and literary conscience--and if American readers had a bit more intelligence and open-minded curiosity--the big houses would be competing to sign writers like Wright and books like "Why I'm Against it All." But they don't, and they won't. Nor will you likely see such small-publisher titles by "regional" writers prominently displayed in the big chain bookstores, if they carry them at all. That's why local independent booksellers and Amazon.com are absolutely essential to the future of free speech, creativity, new talent and truth in America today. We must support them all 
 This novel is about the identity of the individual, and the possibilities and limits of self-reinvention. By failing to transform himself into someone else, Mattia Pascal remains the same person, but radically changed from his experience. Oh, but it's not so complicated.  Mattia Pascal is a good-for nothing- junior who, along with his also-spoiled brother, lose the fortune inherited from their father. Besides losing his fortune, Mattia is forced to make a disastrous marriage. And then, along comes a big and most unexpected chance to run away and become someone else. I won't spoil anything. Just read it and you will find an amazing story. Pirandello's writing is easy. The introduction to the real knot of the story is a little long, but it is absolutely necessary to situate the plot, and moreover, it is very funny. Pirandello's style fluctuates between irreverent and outrageous irony, and melancholic reflections on fate, identity and man's place in the world. Far from being boring, it has extremely funny moments of dark humor (check his confrontations with his mother-in-law). So, it is an extremely recommendable book, because it is intelligent humor with a reflection on life. If you really get to love the story, as I did, you'll end up asking to yourself: "Who the hell am I?" 
 From the day I missed my period up until now with only a month to go until the birth, hardly a day has passed that I haven't consulted this book for something. It is information-packed, yet readable; reassuring, yet realistic; and gives a balanced perspective on potentially controversial things like homebirth and prenatal testing. Like most of the Sears books, it does have the unfortunate tendency to assume that its audience is made up of women in traditional, male-as-breadwinner marriages, and it does get overly corny at times. But those minor problems are easy to overlook in light of how terrific the rest of the book is 
 At the very beginning of the 1970s, Jim Seals and Dash Crofts left the rather unsuccessful band that they had belonged to, and set out on their own. The rest, as they say, is history. Seals & Crofts produced some of the most recognizable soft rock songs of the 1970s - I mean, who hasn't heard Diamond Girl, Hummingbird, and Summer Breeze.  Well, this great CD contains ten of Seals & Crofts greatest tunes. It has the three I listed above, plus such great songs as East Of Ginger Trees and I'll Play For You. Now, if I was to complain about this album, it would be that it is a little short. I mean, twelve or so songs would have made the listening time a bit better.  But, that said, this is a great album. If you are a fan of that smooth, spiritual Seals & Crofts sound, then you must get this CD. I highly recommend it 
 Edith Wharton was (and still is) one of the greatest American authors to have lived. Her ability to capture the the ridiculous of the traditions her society clung to so desperately shows her forward thinking and liberal attitude towards life. The conflict Newland Archer goes through after meeting the Countess, the decision he must make between freedom and tradition is incredible. This book is not a blatant attack on society, but rather it is a foray into the interworkings of a man in a certain place at a certain time who must decide the course of his life; the choice between what is right in his head and what is right in his heart. The countess offers a world where there is the chance of something more, something different, at the expense of leaving his fiance, his family, his whole previous way of life. His struggle with this choice is eartbreaking, as is his decision in the end--and yet it is exactly what should have happened. At the same time, it's also a story of a woman trying to find happiness in a world she does not completely understand, nor perhaps wish to understand. Countess Olenska is not a rebel, she is merely a woman ahead of her time. She desires a life where she makes the decisions, where she can have options beyond those traditionally given to her. Wharton's book is beautifully written and so incredibly natural, she doesn't preach, she doesn't push her agenda. She merely presents the facts as they are, the way life really operated in her time and her New York society and shows how people would truly and honestly react in these situations. Overall, this is one of the greatest books ever written and should be in everyone's library 
 I was hesitant to start collecting Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex because I had watched the first 8 episodes and was not totally convinced to buy it. Well, I collapsed and gave in after seeing the episodes on this disc. The show never ceases to amaze me at how intelligent it is and in the writing. This is quite possibly the best series of anything, ever. And this disc proves it 
 This is a great little printer.  The size is appealing, and it's easy transportable (with a convenient carry-handle on top).  Unfortunately it does not have a battery, so it must still be plugged in.  I really like the fact that the ink and paper are purchased together, and the quantities of both seem to line up fairly well, so I'm not running out of one or the other at different times.  As far as the ink goes, I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about, because, according to Epson, even the different kind of ink this printer uses is still archival quality.  I think the picture quality is good for the price of this machine 
 Have you ever sat in a classroom learning Spanish with books that bored you?  Do you remember reading those terrible passages that taught you nothing and only put you to sleep?  Now, you don't need to suffer that unbearable ordeal any longer.  With this new book, the author has retold Spanish culture in a new way of teaching.  The passages vary and they all contain entertainment and valuable information.  Not only do the passages keep you focussed, but you want to go out and buy the books or newspapers or other sources that this author used in creating this text.  As I read this book, I am intrigued about the writing style, the exercises, and the selected passages.  Out of all the years that I've learned the language using various books, this book has to be the easiest to follow with the most enjoyment.  The book is filled with page turners, and the comparison between various cultures reveals more than just the language, literature, and grammar.  It reveals another side of the language that most people do not learn in their classes.  If I was a department chair for Spanish I would certainly require all the students to buy a copy of this book for educational purposes.  I guarantee you that you will not waste your money with such a wonderfully written book.  This is a very talented author who will succeed far in her writing endeveurs 
 I loved this book. It had me laughing, crying and biting my nails. I fell in love with the characters and knew that I had to continue reading her other navy SEAL books just to read more about Ken and Savannah. It was action packed, filled with suspense, and great sex. I love her books, but this one is my favorite 
 A superb look into the psyche of the fighting man in the Battle for control of the Pacific Islands. Fast moving, page turning adventure 
 Written originally in 1903 both as a gift to African Americans and a gift from an African American, "The Souls of Black Folk" describes through one man's (W. E. B. Du Bois) eyes the consciousness of turn-of-the-century African Americans. Using his own life as a social and psychological model, Du Bois traces the inner life of post-Emancipation and post-Reconstruction African Americans. Whether one agrees with all, most, little, or none of Du Bois' conclusions, any serious student of African American history and self-understanding can't afford to bypass this work.  One of the most intriguing aspects is his candid comparison of his views with Booker T. Washington. Washington promoted a more modest, slower-paced changing of the status quo. He also emphasized what today would be called vocational education as the surest way for African Americans to advance. Du Bois was not totally critical, at times lavishing praise on Washington for his many valiant achievements. However, he was not timid in his appraisal that Washington had trusted too much in European Americans and too little in African Americans.  Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of the forthcoming "Beyond the Suffering: The History of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction." He has also authored "Soul Physicians" and "Spiritual Friends." 
 We had a Linksys WRT54 for a couple of years and I thought that it was doing a nice job. Did some research about what could be a good replacement and found this. Never had heard of the company, but reviews were generally and consistently positive. Signal strength has improved tremendously. Easy set up for my Mac Powerbook. Need to be sure to use ethernet cable provided when setting up security. Very pleased with this router and I would recommend it to anyone. 
 The first essay in Mimesis, 'Odyessus' Scar' is a brilliant, clear statment about the origins of what we define as Western civilization. Auerbach does not speak to our post-colonial times, but he does speak for the heritage that both binds and divides us. His writing and thinking are superb, clear, masterful 
 The book is absolutely wonderful.  It seemed like forever for it to be delivered 
 I found this book innovative and helpful. It provides informative examples best practices, case studies and the latest strategies & techniques that companies can use to control costs and maximize profitability.

 this is very good to have on hand at all times...to refer to...it is also very uplifting.....the words themselves fill you with hope and give you strength as well as courage....a must hav 
 This was a great album, one of 1997's best. At first I thought this was going to be another lame attempt of two unknowns trying to live off the success of already established rappers - Ice Cube & Mack 10. But to my suprise, The Comrads debut stands up next to some of Cube's earlier work, & is way better than anything Mack 10 ever dropped. The standout tracks are 2) Die Hard, 4) Get at Me (Call Me), and 9) Homeboyz. Get this album if you haven't already, jus don't be duped in2 buying their 2nd album released on Mack 10's label

 Over the last 20 years I've purchased many books and got rid of many (After reading them then donating them to charity shops),but this is the only one I've repurchased. I could never get the scenarios and characters out of my head,the way M R James succinctly describes a scene or a, "terrifying agent of supernatural malice" have resided in my head as much as I would have liked them to leave. If lots of Gore is your thing you may be disappointed by these stories, but for those of us who like a well written story told with panache and subtlety these stories are for us. ~~~~ For several years in the early 70's when the BBC made "A Ghost Story for Christmas" it was always the M R James stories that disturbed me the most and even though disturbed by them I was always too fascinated to switch the TV off. And whilst the BBC interpretations were good they never quite captured the atmosphere of the written page.  Most of the "Heroes"(For want of a better word)of these stories are intellectuals from the dusty halls of some Academy or other,who are afflicted by intellectual pride or the even graver sin (In M R James stories)of curiosity! My personal favourites are "The Mezzotint",and "Oh Whistle, and I'll Come to, my Lad". The endings of a few of these stories are not completely resolved, and because of, not in spite of that, they stay in the mind longer. For maximum effect to be read late at night and by candlelight 
 If you're looking for a beautiful and soulful music experience, then look no further, "Start Here." Just when you start to think that The Gloria Record was no more, they come back with an exceptional new album, that finds ways to touch in places you never knew you had. As soon as I heard that Gloria Record was coming to town, I put down everything that I was doing and headed to the show. Before the band even started to perform I decided to purchase this CD, with no clue how it was going to sound. (Little did I know I was buying the CD from Chris Simpson directly.) Well, needless to say, the chance was worth taking. True, The Gloria Record did go through some changes between "A Lull In Traffic" and this album, but only for the better. I think they've grown over this time, shedding their former "I feel like giving up image" and replacing it with a "Get up, you're not quite dead" positive outlook on life. Excuse the term, but "emo" of late is not about loosing youself in depression. We're not "goth" here, that died long ago. From Mineral to The Gloria Record, Chris Simpson has proved that there is more to life then pain. Thank you, Chris 
 I have loved this book from the first time I picked it up, gazed at the cover, and began reading page number one.  I have recommended the book to many people throughout my life, but only people I regarded as "worthy" to read such a magnificent work of prose.  The consequences of my love affair with the "Prince" have been that I now read anything by Pat Conroy, whether it is basketball or cooking or vehicle maintenance if he chooses to go that route.  I seek Mr. Conroy out when I know that he is going to appear on television.  I would marry him, sight unseen, because I know that a man who has the sensitivity to write with such depth of feeling, possesses a beautiful soul. His characters are so vivid, I feel that if I saw them on the street I would have to go up and introduce myself to them, "Hello, Savannah, my name is ______ and I am so sorry for your pain."  Thank you, Mr.Conroy, for making this world a better place because you are in it.  P.S. I make the crab cakes all the time!!!!!    A devoted fa 
 A fictional "what if" account. Max Rothman, an art dealer and WWI veteran meets young Adolf Hitler, an aspiring artist in Munich. Rothman encourages Hitler's art, attempting to mentor him, but the two end up arguing, and Hitler is angsty and unfocused. Hitler appears to be the kind of guy who is gung ho for whatever ignites his passion in the moment, and unfortunately art did not take a stronger hold than politics. Max tried to encourage Hitler to find his own voice-artistic voice-but Hitler eventually found his platform - a dangerous one-after being something of a dismissed misfit in all his other previous incarnations. This is a fascinating take on the question of what if. It imbues personality and complexity and depth to the man Hitler might have been before he rose to power. There are several reviews here on Amazon that are extremely well written and convey the foreboding, ominous feeling one feels while watching this film, knowing what happens in real life. I highly recommend this well-acted and tastefully, intelligently done film and agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers who have written far more eloquently about the film than I have. 
 All three of these books by Sophie Kinsella are just wonderful!  I am not a big reader, but this series is a must read by all women.  If you are or are not a "shopaholic" yourself, you will quickly identify with Becky and all her shopping adventures.  An easy read...and very easy to fall in love.  
 Jeremiah has died from a cop's mistaken bullet. Now, those he has left behind try to figure out how to go on with their lives in this very moving story by Jacqueline Woodson, author of the award-winning LOCOMOTION and HUSH. The 2002 hit by Alice Sebold, THE LOVELY BONES, concerned a young girl watching her family from the afterlife after a violent death. In a similar way BEHIND YOU takes readers into the lives of Jeremiah's mother, father, ex-girlfriend and two friends, along with Jeremiah, as he views life on Earth from the afterlife.  Jeremiah ("Miah"), an African-American prep-school star athlete, left a large hole in many lives. Ellie, his Caucasian girlfriend, finds that her pain does not lessen after months. No one else in her school understands this and tells her that she "is such a widow." Nelia, his mother, is finding it hard to get out of bed. Ellie and Miah's father start visiting her to offer and receive comfort. Kennedy is now the big athlete at the prep school and is tired of people comparing him to Miah. Carlton, a longtime neighborhood friend of Miah's, now has no one to share his secrets with and feels utterly alone.  In between glimpses of the pain-filled people on earth are wonderful scenes of Miah in the afterlife. He finds his beloved grandmother and tries to learn to let go of the connections he maintains to earth.  While sadness is prevalent in this book, hope emerges as Miah's beloved people on Earth find ways to connect to and help each other in surprising ways. Demonstrating her excellent writing skills again, Woodson evokes strong emotion with well-chosen words and characters in BEHIND YOU.     --- Reviewed by Amy Alessi 
 Glad I bought this version.  Unlike some of the others, it is an integrated suite of pieces.  It plays just fine on my Windows PC.  At times the music is strong and forceful, at times energetic like Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, and at other times soft and ethereal.  If you like lyrical music, you'll enjoy the touching love song theme (Across the Stars), which John Williams weaves into the score numerous times.  
 WAITING FOR GODOT is somewhat akin to a conceptual artwork, in which the concept behind the artwork is more important than the sensual aesthetic experience or the entertainment value. In this case, however, what is behind the artwork is a non-concept, the impossibility of creating a masterpiece. After the monumental impossibility of Joyce's FINNEGANS WAKE, what remains for the serious artist? WAITING FOR GODOT is about the impossibility of a masterpiece in the modern world. In that sense, this play is the last masterpiece of "high art." The torch has now passed to movies and popular forms.   Many critics have tried to convince us that WAITING FOR GODOT is very funny and entertaining. I remain skeptical. There are a few moments of wry humor, but not enough to make up for the emptiness of "waiting." There is literally "Nothing to be done" in this play. "Waiting" is a non-action. What's interesting about the play is that the inconsequential dialogues and trivial actions are presented as significant; there's something like an "alienation effect," or a "defamiliarization," as we are invited to ponder how and why this drama is meaningful.  Why is there "Nothing to be done"? Is it simply because it's all been done before? Or is it because life in the modern world is without any serious purpose or meaning? In many ways, WAITING FOR GODOT is a reaction to the Holocaust and Hiroshima. The characters who have "something to do" in this play are Pozzo and Lucky, who by their stupidity illustrate the futility of action in the modern world. 
 If your haven't read any of Ryu Murakami's books; START! There are enough reviews already written about the plot, so I'll just say that the hype is true. I've never read an author who can be so violent and disturbing with his text and then turn around and create moments of such poignancy in the same paragraph! And none of it seems contrived or forced.   Personally, I like Almost Transparent Blue a little more, and it is shorter, so if you are just starting with Murakami, I recommend trying that out first! 
 From the truly great- Buoys and Lighthouse- to the good - Pipkins, Lulu, 5 Man Electrical band (twice), Stampeders, Brewer and Shipley, there's a decent amount of good material here.  The rest is pretty forgettable. I bought it for Lighthouse's great "One Fine Morning" and the Buoys catchy song about cannibalism "Timothy". No accounting for some people's taste! 3.5 Stars 
 Again for my son. He is a Maze Crazy kid and loved this one the best 
 For all of you who remember this particular Charlie Brown cartoon, I highly recommend the DVD version.  I have already shared it with a number of my friends who remembered the cartoon as well and never thought they would see it again.  It's an awesome experience for all 
 This important book could, and should, change what every American does prior, during, and upon returning to the U.S from abroad. It makes the critical point that we are facing a very different world today, and proper preparation can avert catastrophe.   With compelling evidence and argument, Peter Savage explains why the businessperson, tourist, and student alike would do well to strongly consider and ingrain a specific personal security discipline. It powerfully demonstrates that security-like any discipline-is not a skill that can be separated from substance and content. Many of the lessons come straight from what professional intelligence officers practice as routine..."you should not consider the telephones in your hotel as `secure' for discussions of sensitive business or personal matters." P. 159 ..."before walking into the street from your hotel or office, look around at people loitering in the street-both men and women. Observe their facial and clothing details, so you would recognize them if you saw them again later in the day." P. 169..."avoid all pattern and routine." P. 179.  The book is also packed with handy checklists, the latest on health and insurance considerations, and referrals. I applaud Mr. Savage and his work; this book was long overdue and should be continually updated. I can think of no other book of recent years more important for the development of a personal security regimen than this one.

 Don't take this book seriously.  Enjoy it for what it is -a funny, improbable story that celebrates friendship and made me laugh out loud at the situations and characters the author created. This is the story of 5 Southern women who have been friends since high school and are now over 50. They have all had their difficult times but have had each other for support.   It's surprise ending and over the top story line make it perfect for when you want to lighten up.  Yes, it isn't perfect.  I had trouble keeping the 5 friends separate at first but that doesn't really matter.  If you want a perfectly crafted book, find one of the classics but if you just are wanting a good, funny read , pick up this book.  I gave it a 5 star rating because of the joy it brought me and everyone I gave it to.  Laughter rates 5 stars in my book every time.  I am also a huge  fan of the Anne George Southern Sisters books. I was terribly saddened at her passing.The Red Hat Club is even more unbelievable and funnier.  I was glad to find something to raise this Northern woman's spirits. I am now nearly finished the sequel which I think is even funnier than the first. 
 Wow..."A League of Their Own" was by far the best movie I have ever seen.  For any softball player out there from child to adulthood there is something in this movie for you.  The casting was done very well with the comedy of Madonna and Geena Davis.  These women along with all the others showed the transition these women made and the trouble they went through to do the thing they loved.    In reflection of what was said prior on here I agree with the fact that there were many differences between the movie and the actual progression of Women's Professional Baseball League.  Even though they did stray somewhat from the actual series of events, they managed to capture what happened in a way that is enjoyable to watch yet gave a real sense of the sport.  Overall the movie is one that can not go without being seen.  Whether or not you are a softball player, a baseball fan, or nothing at all there is something in this movie for you.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever truly loved a sport 
 I love Southern Living cookbooks. Every recipe I try is a success and becomes a family favorite, "tried and true" recipe.

 Set in the sleepy German town of Bremen, the 1922 German silent film "Nosferatu" is based on the Bram Stoker novel, "Dracula." The film company was unable to obtain the rights to the story, so the names of the Stoker's main characters were changed to avoid legal complications. Bram Stoker's widow sued anyway, and won. All existing copies of the film were ordered to be destroyed by the court handling the case, but since many copies were already in circulation, "Nosferatu" was not lost.  In this version of the vampire legend, a young married man, Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) is commissioned by the peculiar, repulsive Knock (Alexander Granach) to visit Count Orlock in Transylvania. Count Orlock, apparently wants to buy a house in Bremen, and Knock tells Hutter to travel to Transylvania and make the necessary arrangements with the Count. Knock tells his employee not to pay any attention to the stories of phantoms--it's all nonsense. Hutter, who imagines that he's hit the big time with this commission, travels to Transylvania leaving his wife, Ellen (Greta Schroeder) behind in the care of friends.  The trip to Transylvania builds up the suspense as Hutter travels closer and closer to the lair of the Count. Locals at an inn near the castle are full of dread, but Hutter laughs off their horror by blaming the rumours he's been warned about. Even when he's taken by coach to the castle, and dropped some way off because the coachmen fear to go closer, Hutter still proceeds on his journey. The Count's nightmare castle is incredibly atmospheric, but it isn't until Hutter slices his finger while eating dinner that it begins to dawn on him that there's something wrong with this situation. The Count--who doesn't look human--expresses an inordinate amount of interest in Hutter's blood.   While Hutter becomes the Count's next meal, his wife back in Bremen experiences horrible nightmares. Meanwhile the Count travels back to Bremen via his coffin in the cargo hold of a ship. The people back in Bremen begin to read newspaper accounts of the plague spreading throughout the region, and after Nosferatu's coffin arrives, residents are found dead in their beds. Naturally the blame falls on the plague--a disease shrouded in mystery. Fearful residents in Bremen stay isolated in their homes, but death still finds them.  The element of sexuality always evident in later vampire films also exists in the symbolic surrender of a victim as she presents her neck to Nosferatu while collapsing on her bed.  While the film is of great interest to anyone who likes silent film or German Expressionism, it's also fascinating to watch the film and see how the Dracula legend mutated over the years with various versions. Modern versions of Dracula tend to portray him as an accomplished, enigmatic seducer. Nosferatu--on the other hand--looks like a ghoul.  F.W. Murnau's film is a masterpiece of the imagination. Nosferatu is a nightmarish figure--a ghoul who rises from his coffin to relentlessly seek his food. The film--devoid of the special effects that dominate today's cinema is gripping, and the scenes of the rats pouring out of the coffin are unforgettable. This Alpha DVD was fair quality given the film's age. It was certainly watchable--one note however, in the subtitles, the original names--Count Dracula, Renfield etc. are used--displacedhuma

 Since I just retired after 33 years at one company, I wanted to read about help in what I should do in my retirement. This book gave me some good insight. I recommend it 
 As anyone who knows me, knows that I love prison films (Escape From Alcatraz, Birdman of Alcatraz, The Shawshank Redemption) and TV shows (Oz.) This is no exception. Tom Selleck is very good as a man framed by two inept and corrupt cops (including David Rasche, in a 180-degree turn from his Sledge Hammer character.) Laila Robins is wonderful as his wife, who stands by him through thick and thin. Well worth a rental, or even a buy, as the DVD is priced very low 
 This book is the Bible of information security.  I stumbled into the 3rd edition (published in 1995) years ago and found it quite helpful, but dated by the time I acquired it.  I was simply stunned and enthralled when I discovered a 4th edition had been published. I ordered it immediately, and waited impatiently to arrive... (2 day air)... I received it today, and I can't put it down.  It has completely exceeded my expectations, which were considerable given I was very much impressed with the 3rd.  This book belongs in any security professionals library.  If you haven't got it, you are missing the definitive compendium of security information. Once you have mastered this text, other books do an excellent job of drilling further into the details, but few can exceed the sheer scope and thoroughness of this tome.  For those worried about acquiring obsolete texts, this edition is completely current and up to date!  Very impressive. Highly recommmended 
 Jaded from having read almost every major treatise on legal writing written in the past twenty years, I was surprised by how much I liked Professor Stark's book.  It's practical, comprehensive, (I especially liked  that he even gave advice about how to write reply briefs, amicus briefs,  and e-mail, subjects rarely considered elsewhere.  Bravo!),  bathroom-readable, and funny.  (He titles a chapter "Yes, Virginia,  you can even make patent applications more readable by studying board games  and cookbooks,")  For the price, it's an excellent value, especially  when compared to Bryan A. Garner's bloated, ego-driven behemoth "The  Winning Brief," which, while making good points, also includes several  idiotic ones.  Unlike Garner, Stark never succombs to trying to be  different simply to stand out from the crowd.  For that, he gets my highest  praise 
 This is an incredibly honest and inspiring story.  I laughed and I cried along with Ms. Gilbert.  She says things I have thought but never thought could be said out loud.  I am recommending this book to everyone I know 
 It is so wonderful to see the continuation of Chicano/Mexicano cultural production that exclaims to the World, we are still here. The songs performed are reminiscence of the Mexican classical masters of the past, i.e.  Cuco Sanchez, Migel Mejia,  and Jose Alfredo Jimenez. All the Musicians on this album are superb and accomplished musicians. If you love Mariachi or Mexican music, you will truly love This album.  
 From the beginning to the end was excellent. The music played throughout the movie wasnt scary but funny in a scary twisted way. I think it is a great movi

 Although I admit it is nothing all that groundbreaking from a quantitative perspective, it is GROUNDBREAKING in the Software Domain. Demarco and Lister have produced another must read classic. They shatter the fallacy of the binary project plan success/fail model. GANTT Charts going out beyond a few weeks are not worth the paper they are printed on. The only value would be if it is understood that this one possible reality is just that. It is a `possibility' that could range from 0% probability of success to 100% with 0% being (as the book shows) far more the norm today. People bet their careers on plans every day that have no possible chance of succeeding in software and WE ALLOW IT TO GO ON when we know better! We waste billions and as far as I can tell other executives are too intimidated, scared of technology or just plan hoodwinked into letting this sham go on. IT MUST STOP.  Managers cannot predict the future. The only way (and this is common sense to anyone OUTSIDE Software) is to use statistics and probabilistic measures to predict future, uncertain outcomes. If every CEO were to read this book and made sure an IT manager was never forced to commit to a single immutable date, with X dollars, Y Resources, Z Scope, and production quality, we might just make a dent in the absolute joke software development is in Corporations today. Are their exceptions? OF COURSE! But they are not the rule, they are just that: the exception.  Is it a universal failure based on a fundamental lack of knowledge or desire to learn? I have no idea but any risk manager worth a cent knows that the current status quo is a joke in software. Why do you think the most volatile C-Level position is the CTO/CIO and the least likely to be promoted to CEO is the same position?  Don't believe me? Just read the latest Standish group study.

 What it is: A political history of the US focusing on the 2nd quarter of the 19th century.  This book is so well researched and written that even the footnotes are of interest.  What it isn't: A biography of Andrew Jackson 
 Blew through this one in a few days - highly entertaining, excellent read.  Fun fun book.  Such a great story and great characters.  This should be a movie but they'd probably screw it up.  It's a great read - sad to finish it really.  But glad to discover another writer I like.  Can't wait to see what else he's done and see if it's as good.  Or better!  Read this book it's GREAT 
 I attened High School from 1962 to 1966 and grew up on this kind of music.  So anybody in their mid 50's should enjoy this DVD.  You can't avoid singing along while clapping your hands. If you have kids or grandkids you can show them what real music and real singing was in "your days" 
 Beginning Perl, 2nd edition, by James Lee, et al., is a splendid introduction to the Perl programming language, version 5.8.3.  The flow of the book is logical, straightforward, and highly readable.  Text is heavily sprinkled with program examples that the reader can easily try out along the way, as well as exercises at the end of most chapters, with solutions in the appendix.  Chapters are short, clear, and engaging.  After a brief discussion of the history of Perl and a listing of numerous helpful online resources, the book quickly moves on to the logistics of running a Perl program, followed by descriptions of basic program elements and control flow.  Then it's ahead to more sophisticated data elements - lists, arrays, and hashes - and finally functions and subroutines.  After a solid and seemingly effortless explanation of these "basics," the book moves to one of the most powerful features in Perl - regular expressions - and how these can be used to access files and data.  From there, the discussion expands to string processing and references.  The book concludes with discussions of more "advanced" Perl features, including object-orientation, modules, and use with webservers and databases.  Regardless of topic, the writing style stays crisp, clear, and example-filled, making this book a highly effective and enjoyable way to get a jump-start into Perl programming for the novice or a quick refresher for the expert wanting a Perl 5 update. 
 Howard Hewett was one of the 1980s best R&B crooners but he was not able to realize his full potential. Lovely ballads such as "I Commit To Love", "Stay", "I'm For Real" ,"Once Twice Three Times" and the immortal "Say Amen" will show you the magnitude of his talent 
 This is book three in a series, and you should read the first two books to fully understand the setting.  It can be read as a stand alone book, but you will lack some of the background.  It is a complex plot involving elves (mages and not so magical), humans (free and slaves), halfbloods (who mostly seem to have wizard capability), dragons, and some really dangerous creatures that inhabit a particular forest, including an invisible ambusher.  The elves, who have invaded the planet through a magical gate, only occupy part of the territory.  They have long lives, but a low birthrate.  Considering the various intrigues and dangers, it is amazing that they could last as long as they have.  Everyone seems to lust for power, but power corrupts.  A revolt by younger sons (mostly somewhat inept), various slave revolts, halfbloods seeking their own power, attempts at assassinations, interference by dragons, and creatures that eat occasional wayfarers make for an interesting plot.  Some of the action seems to drag at points.  It was not a page turner until it got towards the end.  Various inconvenient characters are removed, not quite like Mark Twain's device of having people wander out into the yard and fall down a well, but by introducing various dangers they encounter, inserted into the story for that purpose (a large carnivore, a murderous machine, or just being carried off by a hungry demon looking for dinner).  Some characters are nasty pieces of work, so one does not waste much sympathy on their plight.  Somehow the white hats survive.  The hero, who is against slavery, has a couple concubines purchased from the market.  He is a long-lived elf, and at thiry is still in his adolescence, so has not found a wife.  He is living with his mother, and has not seemed to reach the maturity needed for a marriage (or maybe he is just overly picky) 
 I was completely blown away by this book.  It is easy to read, and has solid advice without any hidden agenda.  I have purchased 6 copies so far and given them to family and friends.  (My own copy is currently being borrowed by a co-worker.)   It is sad that so many people fail to plan for retirement.  They don't have the basic knowledge about investing and for some reason our current education system perpetuates it.  A little education goes a long way and I would agree with the person below that this book would make a great gift for your children.  It would be especially useful for those in school who will be entering the workforce soon.  
 Carl Sagan defined what a true scientist should be like, a skeptical, logically thinking, intellectual person. He truely delites word by word page by page. You can almost imagine him speaking to himself in that unique voice that carried with it a  love for truth, knowledge, and such a vast amount of respect for science... Everyone should read it Period

 This book has made my top ten novels of all time list. The last 100 pages are so intense I defy anyone to put it down. Suspence, Horror, what a ride. The characters were great but the setting was a character unto itself. A great fun book to read 
 With the plethora of study material now available to any student of any level of learning, a "study" Bible is a little obsolete.  Space constraints in study Bibles require limited notes on even very important subjects and no notes at all on many others.  It is also virtually impossible for the compiler of the study Bible to avoid personal slants and interpretations in his or her notes.    These considerations suggest an alternative approach to the Bible student's library, i.e. a good "plain" Bible for reading and a separate collection of excellent reference material for study.  The Cambridge KJV Large Print Bible in French Morocco Leather perfectly meets the need for a good reading Bible.  The print is well-sized for easy reading and avoiding eye fatigue.  The book itself is kept to a manageable size making carrying it to church or other meetings a pleasure rather than a chore. The binding, cover, and fit and finish is of the high quality for which Cambridge is famous.  This Bible can be expected to give years of pleasurable service.  An excellent value for the student, pastor or ordinary Christian seeking a good quality KJV Bible just for reading and enjoying.  
 I understand that compressing five very detailed books of the Bible into one 3-hour movie is going to require some "simplification."  But, strangely, PART 1 follows the text of the books very closely, but then PART 2 almost completely departs from the text.  Admittedly, this is because Part 1 (fully half of the movie) takes from 1/2 of one book (out of five), and Part 2 then attempts to cover the remaining 4 1/2 books.  Part 1 adds some "dramatic effect" which I don't completely object - mainly stuff that makes sense: Moses has a certain affinity for his Egyptian "brother" with whom he was raised.  I can understand that.  And Part 1's treatment of how God talks with Moses is really good.  But by Part 2, God has become an "eerie inner voice" or a "spectral influence" that leaves you wondering, "perhaps it's all in Moeses' head?"  But the Books of Moses, in the Bible, show God as a very present, driving force.  It says that God spoke to Moses face to face as a man talks with his friend.  But Part 2 has Moses thinking he is hearing voices whispering in the wind.    And all throughout the scenes of Part 2, in every instance where Moses has some inner strife about what he is doing, in the Books of Moses it is very clear that God is speaking to him plainly all the time, telling him exactly and precisely what to do.  At one point, God is so much a figment of Moses imagination, that he says "they have to win this victory themselves" and "they have to travel through the dessert without him (God)" to prove themselves.  This is, of course, nonsense.  God was with them at every step.  They were in the desert in the first place because God led them there.   Apart from that, there are the very many parts that just have to be left out to get it crammed into a 3 hour slot.  But it seems to me that some of these are important parts.  And it seems that, unfortunately, a lot of truth is sacrificed in order to accomplish this.    For instance, a lot of the times where people are punished, it appears that Moses has, under pressure, made a judgement when actually, in the text, GOD made a judgement and instructed Moses to carry it out.    Even in Part 1 there was the beginnings of this treatment.  All of the plagues that visited Pharoh, God had told Moses specifically what was going to happen, and WHY!  And He specifically instructed Moses what to say to Pharoh.  But you can miss that with this movie.    Ultimately, this movie is about WWMD, not WWGD or WWJD.  Overall, though, worth watching.  Just realize that for the full story, you really need to READ THE BOOK.  
 Reading Ezra Pound is a remarkable experience.  I find it amazing how attentive Ezra Pound is when it comes to the 'sound of poetry.'  Reading his poems are aesthetically pleasing to the ear.  It is consistent with his  doctrine, "Behave as a good musician will do" when it comes to  poetry.  I find his translation of "River-merchant's Wife: A  Letter" as one of the greatest highlight in modern poetry, along with  many other poem included in this book 
 Excellent!  I gave this book to my sister who lost her granddaughter to cancer and she said it provided the most help of all.  Thanks so much 
 Shore Leave is one of the best episodes of the classic series. It uses all the sci fi props but also has a great story, if you don't even care about Star Trek and have to watch one, watch this one.  
 Harb is the best ski writer & teacher in the world, with the possible exception of his friend Lito Flores (see his books, videos & website titled Breakthrough on Skis).  The book is not real easy reading, but it is worthwhile plowing through it, and his theories and technique work.  If you are not interested in technique and knowing why methods work it's probably not for you.  There is also a PMTS website for discussion which you can find by Googling it. PMTS is Harald's method. The video is also good 
 I have always been a fan of Judi Dench; her acting has inspired me.  I enjoyed the book very much.  I have never bought a book about an actress in my lifetime but I couldn't resist this one.  It's on my table in the living room and everyone scans it and tells me they are going to buy it too 
 The Black Moon marked Winston Graham's return to the Poldark series, which he had inexplicably allowed to lie fallow from the 1953 release of Warleggan, to the 1973 publication of this extraordinary novel. The title of this book comes from an ancient myth with roots deep in Cornwall's Celtic past, of an astronomical/meteorological condition called a "black moon" and the curse it is said to place on the life of any child born under it, as the son of Elizabeth Warleggan (nee Chynoweth, later Poldark) was. Though George Warleggan, now married to the woman he has long loved from afar, Elizabeth, should be a man at peace or one at least basking in the glory of at last achieving a great ambition, he quickly becomes a figure lost in a personal torment that may or may not be linked to the curse of the black moon. Where he might be thought pleased with his new wife...and son...his titanic fortune, his power, now so great that this blacksmith's grandson can easily buy his way into the nobility, George becomes more restless chapter by chapter, and his hatred for his old rival, Ross Poldark, magnifies till it seems ready to consume him.  Against the menace of Warleggan's stormy soul, Demelza's two brothers, Sam and Drake, honest young men of ardent Methodist leanings, appear in the series (and are soon at odds with Warleggan)  as does a shy, scholarly cousin of Elizabeth's, Morwenna Chynoweth, for whom George Warleggan arranges what should be a suitable marriage to a well-placed churchman, but which is in fact the last thing the introverted Morwenna ever wanted, and is in all reality a tragic disaster. In this book, Dr. Enys, having accepted a position as a surgeon aboard a warship, is taken prisoner by the French, and Ross and a party of mercenaries he assembles travel across the Channel to secure his friend's release.  Amid all this one finds remarkable tales of the niceties and unpleasantnesses of eighteenth-century Cornish life. There are also larger-than-life characters, exciting situations, and informative moments that highlight the influence these earlier times in our culture's evolution had on what is, temporarily, the present 
 This band produced alot of good songs back in the 60's. Their most well known song and a huge hit was House Of The Rising Sun.Thats got a tune that just seems to stick in you head.Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood is another one of my favorites here.Eric Burdon and the band had a special sound.We Gotta Get Out Of This Place is another big hit i love that tune.It's My Life is another well known song from the Animals.San Franciscan Nights is a song i also like. Bands like this were around for a shore time,but made some of the best songs. 
 This is a good book if one buys it to just have something to read, but I had to buy it because it was being used as a textbook in my class. It's very interesting, but not the typical textbook set-up, which I would've preferred. I guess, though, that maybe this book isn't usually used as a textbook. Anyhow, it's very interesting, and I think someone interested in the Middle East would enjoy it. Bernard Lewis is an excellent writer but like others have said, he lacks any kind of humor or colorful writing. It is a little dry and boring in some parts.   Lewis talks about the Golden Age of discovery and cultural achievements, and although I've read from other sources that this was during the reign of the Abbasids, Lewis rarely hints at what part the Abbasid reign played in sponsoring these achievements. This made it very difficult to write a paper for my class on the Golden Age and how the Abbasids contributed to it. It also didn't list many dates for these achievements which was upsetting 
 If anything, this first volume is even more entertaining than Volume 2.  The spoofs are funny, the serious stories deep and interesting, and overall it stays true to the spirit of Star Wars.  My favorite was probably the one detailing Darth Vader's conflict with the Dark Woman, but I could find something awesome about every story in this volume.  This is a comic book, but it's well put together and durable, so it gets a definite five stars from me.  Good for all ages 
 This book should be right up there with Elaine Pagels' work on the Gnostic Gospels and Margaret Starbird's work on Mary Magdalene. In her characteristically sophisticated and trenchant style, Spretnak interprets and advances the case for the current grassroots resurgence of Marian spirituality, restoring her as a mystical female embodiment of power, compassion, and grace.  In doing so, she gives Mary -- BIG Mary, in all her fullness -- BACK to progressives inside the Catholic Church, as well as those who have left the Church, particularly on feminist grounds. She also introduces her to Christians and others who may never have had the benefit of learning about this powerful manifestation of the Sacred Feminine in the West.  What's more, by movingly sharing her own love and spiritual connection with Mary, Spretnak invites the rest of us intellectuals who have been cut off from spirit in this post-modern world to open our hearts to new mystical possibilities.  As someone who grew up Catholic but has since become disenchanted with the Church and all of its male hierarchy, I was ecstatic reading this book about the Great Mother who has been in my backyard all along 
 This is an excellent book and really addresses writers' fears.  It does give you the courage to write.  I strongly recommend this book to both new and old writers.  This is a keeper 
 Brother Cadfael is both pleased and displeased when his old love, Richildis, arrives at the Abbey with her husband, to take up residence as a permanent lodger. In return for permanent food, shelter and all things comfortable, Richildis's husband, Gervase Bonel, proposes to deed the ownership of his manor to the Abbey, a fact which does not sit well with his stepson, Edwin, to whom was promised ownership of the manor. In old age, Gervase had grown cantankerous and had taken a spiteful pleasure in goading Edwin into a rage about reneging on his promise of passing on the ownership of the manor to him. After eating a highly spiced and sauced dish of partridge, Gervase dies, and suspicion immediately falls on Edwin. The dish was poisoned with monkshood, an oil made of which, was brewed by Cadfael to use as a liniment for the old and arthritic monks. As usual in a Cadfael story, there are several characters who have equal reason and opportunity to have committed the murder, so it's up to Cadfael to sort out the mystery. It's another fascinating story, set in the 12th century, with a wealth of detail about mediaeval life and with Brother Cadfael sorting out the clues 
 This workbook provides comprehensive and practical information for one of the greatest issues in our society today.  It includes an explanation of the costs of anger, undertanding your anger, and a myriad of techniques to effectively control your anger including relaxation skills, Cognitive Behavioral skills, problem solving and much more.  this book is a great resource for clinicinas working with anegr in theoir careers as well as those who desire a resource to help them explore and handle the anger that resides within them.  Highly recommended 
 This is great kitsch. Some will long for a world like this but of course it never was like this. But if you want to know why ALCOHOLISM means death to the nation, and why plain laziness is the trouble with many, this book is for you 
 Purchased this tricycle for my grandson - 3rd birthday - a huge success!!!!  Not only was it reasonably priced, it came w/free shipping - great deal 
 The process of eliciting requirements suffers from some of the same problems as the process of collecting information for expert systems. A person does not really know how much he or she knows about a subject.  Each of us knows something so well, that much of what we know is not part of our conscious awareness. It is hard to bring that information to the conscious mind to share with another person.  What this tells me is when I am in the role of eliciting requirements from another person, I need many different ways of getting information, because different means will achieve different results. I can take an analytical approach (tell me about...), a physical approach (show me ...), and a creative approach (let's play a game ...).  The more approaches I use, the more information I will get.  What I love about Innovation Games is that games use a part of the brain that we tend to ignore when "at work", bypassing the analytical parts and tapping into the fun, creative areas.  This is a great way to find new information about the requirements of a product or service.  I think it works especially well because most people I interview are expecting an analytical approach, and using games brings a fresh perspective.  Luke Hohmann has really captured a great set of games. He explains the games very clearly, and gives detailed instructions for how to organize an Innovation Games session so that everyone can make effective use of his techniques.  Thanks so much Luke for bringing us another great book. 
 This book along with the "202" book by the same author are "must have"s for costume jewelry collectors, buyers and sellers.  I can't rate them highly enough.  
 I am very pleased with this bagpack. It has a lot of space, useful pockets and wears easily. The only disadvantage is that it is a little heavy even when it's empty. It's made of fine materials, very good quality.  
 Even if you've been graphing for decades or are a scientific or statistical sophisticate, this book is more valuable than you'd guess.  You may know some stuff to help make your graphing better, but I bet there are many more principles, features, and techniques you simply never thought of.  This book has these.  But for even more incisive visualizations, you should get also Cleveland's "Visualizing Data".  You'll need both books really. (There's not much overlap.) Even though making use of graphical perception principles increases the power of your graphs (the main topic of "Elements of Graphing Data"), there are even more incisive graph types you need to learn about; only a couple of these are in "Elements"; the others are in "Visualizing Data".  After digesting Cleveland's two books, you will be a master data-behaviour elucidator.  Once in a great while you may need the old statistical inference paradigm (test-statistics & p-values), but much more often you will be so glad you have the power of Cleveland's visualization paradigm to use instead.  But again, you will need both "Elements of Graphing Data" and "Visualizing Data".  Start with "Elements" though.  The book reads easily, is interesting and has a bonus for those into perceptual psychology.  A neato tidbit:  the author's research results on graphical perception were given in part as graphs -- leading to the nifty "the medium is the message" thing.  No matter what aspect of "Elements" you look at, it is simply marvelous -- all substance, and several points (not just a single point for a whole book like Tufte did in his book) 
 There are enough reviews here to cover the major topics of the book.  Allow me to add that it is also very enjoyable to read.  If you love politics, or are just interested in what qualities a good leader should have, buy this book 
 Let me begin by saying that, had I discovered this book on my own, without Mark Moskowittz's STONE READER documentary, I would have been recommending it to every serious reader I know. I approached it with some reservation, expecting to find an overhyped work that had gone out of print for good reason, but I was utterly captivated within the first five pages. Fifty pages in, I was saying "Wow!"   Dow Mossman's THE STONES OF SUMMER seems to attract a remarkable degree of vitriol from reviewers. Readers apparently either love it or hate it, perhaps somewhat the way people respond to modern art. It is surely a far from perfect work, but rather than pick nits about individual sentences and images, I found myself reading right through them, accepting them for the atmosphere they create as if I was reading poetry. For me, at least, the story flowed into a larger societal picture that resonated with the sense of betrayal and despair generated by the antiwar,  counterculture movement of the late 1960's.   THE STONES OF SUMMER is a remarkable first novel, and sadly, an apparently last novel as well. As past reviews suggest, it is also not everyone's cup of tea. This book is not a mindless summer read, nor is it a page-turning thriller. But readers whose tastes run to Saramago, Pynchon, DeLillo, Faulkner, or Garcia Marquez are likely to find Dow Mossman's book intriguing and enjoyable (if less polished), a deeply felt story wrapped in prose so exuberant, so manically transcendent, it practically leaps off the page and grabs you by the throat. Unlike so many popular works (Ludlum, Grisham, King, Cussler, Clancy, etc.) whose stories are as memorable as last week's hot dog, this is a book you will never forget.   On its surface, THE STONES OF SUMMER tells the coming of age story of Iowa-born Dawes Oldham Williams (D.O.W.) in three segments.  The first takes place when a precocious, eight year old Dawes visits his grandfather's racing greyhound farm during summer vacation, with flashbacks to Dawes' relationship and adventures with a troublemaking friend named Ronnie Crown. The second segment occurs 7-10 years later, during Dawes' rather wild and crazy high school years, ending in tragedy on his last night at home before college. The final section takes place another ten years later and finds Dawes on his way to, and living in, Mexico, still trying to cope with personal losses, hopelessness, and borderline schizophrenia.   Each section of the book speaks in its own voice. The opening, 1949-1950 segment is densely written, filled with the soaring, spiraling imagery for which the book is best known. We are introduced to Dawes' ineffectual, Donna Reed mother and nearly as bland stepfather, a dark and imposing grandfather with a hair-trigger temper and dog-eat-dog temperament reminiscent of Joe McCarthy, and a sybil-like neighbor woman named Abigail Winas who raises chickens and all but reads their entrails. The second section, 1956-1961, is more chronologically told in somewhat more straightforward prose and dialog, suggesting the sexual and cultural revolution just then beginning. The final section, 1967-1968, is almost hallucinatory, filled with journal writings, letters, a short novel by Dawes, and a story line about sanity, drugs, Vietnam, and the sexual revolution.    THE STONES OF SUMMER deals with the great American awakening from 1950 to 1968, culminating with the tragedy of the Vietnam War and the death of American innocence. It is a novel about personal identity and individuality, alienation, the role of history (both personal and national), and the relativity of truth. In the end, it is also a story of rebellion against tradition and cultural mores and the burdens falling upon those who rebel. The message is classic, the execution is powerful, the story is tragic. Writing in 1972, Mossman proved prescient about the absurdity of American culture and political values, going so far as to conjecture about the ridiculous notion of Ronald Reagan as a President! Dawes Williams would have laughed until he cried if he had seen what has come to pass with the Bush Administration's manufacturing of its own history with regard to Iraq: WMD's, toppling Saddam's statue, Jessica Lynch, the Thanksgiving turkey, "Mission Accomplished," "We're making good progress. They all love us," and the like. He had seen the enemy, and it was us. Aaatttssssss Dawes!  There is certainly room for valid criticism of this book. The female characters lack depth, the prose is sometimes just too extravagant, the literary allusions lack subtlety, some of the dialog is pretentious to the point of self-parody, and the Huck Finn references (particularly Dawes having a girlfriend named Becky Thatcher) are overplayed. Yet despite these drawbacks, Dow Mossman masterfully captures America's own coming of age story in a way few authors have 
 This book is the most eye-opening, amazing, enlightening and practical work I have ever read. There were so many jewels of wisdom and edifying anecdotes in these pages. Anyone who is serious about improving their relations with others on the job and socially should read this work with the utmost attention. If everyone practiced these simple principles, this society would be truly utopian. That is why I bought 12 of them: to be able to give it to friends and associates who I believe would really benefit from it 
 Adam Kahane (2004) said that a friend of his told him that the old "1960s slogan `If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem' actually misses the most important about effecting change.  The slogan should be, he said, `If you're not part of the problem, you can't be part of the solution.'  If we cannot see how what we are doing or not doing is contributing to things being the way that they are, then logically we have no basis at all, zero leverage, for changing the ways things are--except from the outside, by persuasion or force" (pp. 83-84).  Any problem is part of a system, in other words, and if we are experiencing the problem, then we must, by definition, be a part of the problem.  This book explores this concept and provides many tools and examples to help resolve conflict through deep listening and generative dialogue. 
 Here is a fine collection of songs you will not find anywhere else;  and at a good price.  I have to admit I'm not a big fan of Ferlin Husky's voice (I find it too "whiney"), but his biggest hits are included here, and the sound is excellent.  Included on this album are his signature songs "Wings of a Dove" and "Once";  as well as a fair rendition of Don Gibson's "I Cant Stop Loving You".  
 This book is a must for anyone dealing with either Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's Disease.  I put off buying this book because I have Crohn's disease, but I must tell you it was one of my biggest mistakes.  If you, or someone you love, is dealing with IBD get this book.  So many of Rolf's feelings and thoughts were the same thing I was thinking when I first had to deal with this disease.  Rolf is an inspiration, he proves that you can live your life with these diseases and live it to the fullest 
 This is a great end to one of the best franchises of my life time.  I saw the movie at a prescreen and loved it.  I left the theater thinking "Rocky Should Have WON!!!!!".  I had the same feeling I had after not watching number one for awhile and going back and seeing it. After watching the movie again on bluray and doing something ive never done before (watched all the extras)I decided I think the ending is just fine.  There is another ending of the movie that is in the extras that while it felt good it didnt leave the same depth and contentment that the movie version had.  I must say this is one that should have been made instead of 5.  (even though I liked 5) 
 Great story on how an African-American male and a Jewish woman become great friends.  Very few movies keep my attention, but this one did 
 Tim Robbins (Woody Blake) and Gary Sinise (Jim McConnell) star in this exciting and entertaining film about the first manned spaceflight to the planet Mars.  The mission is under the command of Luke Graham (played by Don Cheadle), and after six months of spaceflight, the group of astronauts finally lands on the red planet.  However, the Martian landscape proves to be most inhospitable, as some unseen force from beneath the surface of the planet unleashes its fury on the small band of astronauts.  Luke is the only survivor.  He somehow manages to send a cryptic and garbled last message to NASA describing the events which befell his group.  NASA immediately launches the Mars Recovery Mission, led by McConnell and Blake, to investigate the mysterious happenings and bring back survivors, if there are any.  Also along for the ride are Phil Ohlmyer (played by Jerry O'Connell), and Terri Fisher, Woody's wife, (played by Connie Nielsen).  During the flight, the ship encounters a micro-meteor shower, and the hull is breached.  Working quickly, Jim and Woody manage to seal the punctured hull (or so they thought), but when they begin their descent to the Martian surface, a tremendous explosion rocks the ship.  The crew is forced to abandon ship and try to reach a smaller scout ship which was inside the larger one.  Due to poor calculations, the astronauts must navigate in space with jet packs to reach the smaller ship.  Unfortunately, Woody overshoots the ship, but the others reach it safely and descend to the surface.  Once on Mars, the crew finds Luke and learns that he has made an amazing discovery; there is a large white face on the surface of the planet, but he doesn't know how it got there.  When the astronauts go to investigate, they find that many of the secrets of the solar system are hidden inside.  Will the crew make it back to earth safely?  This is a very good movie.  The acting, especially by Sinise and Robbins, is excellent.  I've always been a big fan of Gary Sinise and his movies, including "Apollo 13" and "Forrest Gump", and he's just as good in this movie.  Robbins gives a performance on par with his "Bull Durham" role.  The special effects are eye-popping, and the dance scene, complete with Van Halen's "Dance the Night Away", is one of the movie's best.  I recommend this movie very highly.  Science Fiction fans will be sure to enjoy the secrets that lie on the Martian surface 
 Plenty of interesting ideas and some new takes on old information but otherwise a very badly written book in serious need of editing and counseling. Material is repeated and re-examined endlessly throughout the book giving the impression the authors initially finished at 88 pages and realized they desperately needed to pad the thing to get it published.  I'm still stuck on "Mortal Error"--the book that gives a whole different take on part of the assassination, that the last shot was an accident. That book, right or wrong, has very interesting explanations of a lot of material and the author is a ballistics expert.  The Kennedy Assassination was not an isolated event--as the public and even conspiracy theorists like to view it--but a "systems" event of astonishing complexity. This book, despite its huge flaws, is one of the best to tap into that mentality. There explanations of French politics of those years in regard to Algeria and Viet Nam and subsequently the assassination are cogent. I just think a systems approach was a bit beyond the authors.  We need to understand, especially today, that an assassin, or anyone else, can be a terrorist, a double-agent, a patriot, a mobster, a politician, a drug dealer, a compassionate and loving parent, and a number of other things somewhat simultaneously. There is a front office world and a deep dark back office world and unfortunately that back office world, especially since WWII, is really what's now driving the modern world. One can find a straightforward conspiracy or two behind Lincoln's assassination or simple motives behind Garfield's or McKinley's but Kennedy's will always be elusive. It gnaws at us, whether we realize it or not, because it was the first major global event to publicly, even if for a few moments, reveal the workings of that hidden world.   The assassination did not go off as planned. As the authors state, Officer Tippet was certainly supposed to have killed Oswald and Oswald would have been yet another kook killer in the history books. Case closed. Jack Ruby was pure desperation and subliminally we all caught that. That single moment in the basement was the point of ignition for doubt. It looked and smelled so wrong. If the last shot was also a dumb mistake then this one probably had even the insiders panicked for a few days until the information got sorted out. No triangulation--one shooter, one patsy.   Don't blame the Warren Commission--all nice guys who weren't about to rock the boat. They looked at all the info, realized what it meant, and did the best PR patch job they could. Nobody had to say boo to them, they just all had to be individuals who knew how the system worked, not even active participants in that system. What was to be gained by the truth? Nothing but disruption, nothing but wearing on the nerves of a lot of content and sleeping people. What was to be gained by letting Kennedy live? Less than nothing--the man was a major liability on too many fronts alive and a major asset to too many people--even his own party--dead. This wasn't about anti-communism or oil or even heroin, as the authors speculate. All that is linear-think. This was about the maintainence of a smoothly functioning global system.    
 This book was beyond my expectations. I've been a knitter for over 30 years now, but I never thought one could knit such pieces. They are works of art more than knitted pieces. This book is a joy to look at, over and over and over again. It helps thinking outside the box and that there is more to knitting as one would believe. Great book 
 Darwin on Trial was responsible for alerting many among the public and in the scientific community to the deficiencies of Darwinism. UC Berkeley law professor Phillip E. Johnson applies his skills as an analyzer of evidence to ask if Darwin's theory holds up to scrutiny.  Johnson begins by recognizing a stark contradiction in the law: creationism has been banned by the courts because it is "religion," yet evolution is permitted despite the fact that evolutionary literature is full of anti-religious arguments.  Johnson might be willing to tolerate this hypocrisy if evolution proves correct.  But he argues that when natural selection proves to be a tautology, whose empirical power has proven to cause little more than oscillations in the sizes of finch beaks, he has just cause to be skeptical.    When looking at the fossil record, Johnson finds a landscape starkly lacking in evidence of evolutionary transitions but rich in stasis (i.e. no significant change in a given biological form).  The few which are allegedly called "transitional" do little to tip the scales in favor of evolution. Molecular evidence for evolution turns out to be based upon assumptions, and molecular evolutionary intermediates are beyond the reach of scientific investigation. Finally, Johnson reveals that the evidence for prebiological evolution is contradicted by geochemistry.    Evolution clearly loses a trial based upon the evidence.  Why, then, does the jury of the scientific community overwhelmingly vote in favor of Darwin's theory?  Johnson argues that Darwinism is propped up by a question-begging definition of science, one that requires naturalistic causes in keeping with the philosophy of naturalism.    Though many volumes by design proponents have covered similar topics, none summarizes the range of evidence against evolution and its philosophical underpinnings more lucidly or succinctly than Darwin on Trial 
 a very rich collection of every Beatles story, hundreds of full color pictures, anecdotes, just everything that was "the Beatles". a brilliant result of the last time Paul, George and Ringo got to work together for telling us their compelte story as the band which shaked the world. hard cover, luxurious publish. Beatles excelence 100 
 This was the textbook in my Native American History Class this summer at the University where I am persuing a History Degree with a minor in Teacher Certification.  I must say that this is one of the best textbooks that I  have used since I began college.  The author has taken a wide and complex  field of Native American (Indian) History and has effectively narrowed it  to interesting and important events.  This is a textbook that reads very  well.  The tragic story of the Native American is told with sensitivity and  accuracy.  From the beginning of recorded American Indian History to the  tragic consequences of dealing with European Invaders-Explorers and its  aftermath.  The accounts of the Colonial Indians, 5 Civilized Tribes,  Indian Wars to present day wounded knee, and so much more are given  excellent focus to the student/reader.  I highly recommend this book to any  Professor who will teach Native American History 
 I finally bought a copy of this book for myself after having to borrow it from my plant friends and professors.  They would not permit it out of their sight!  Anyway it is a very good start to getting accustomed to grasses.  They can be quite challenging to identify but this book is very helpful.  It is pretty basic, to the point and recommended.  It may be a bit challenging for a newbie, but really there is no easy way to learn plant terminology.  This one is a good ice breaker 
 Here's a poet worthy of that label they've slapped on her: genius.  No need to be jealous, just willing to learn from her 
 I thoroughly enjoy my Audubon field guides and the Mammals of North America is the most Interesting of the list. It is definitely a must have for anyone interested in animals. With tons of color photos of virtually  every species in North america this is a great buy! Descriptions are longer  and have more information than the Peterson series but some photographs are  hard to see the identifyable traits of the specimen. Perfect size to throw  in the pack and head out to the field to spot your favorites 
 BOBBY BARE IS AS WARM AS HIS MUSIC. I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE AND PRIVELAGE OF MEETING HIM AS WELL AS HIS DEAR WIFE, JEANNIE AND SON, BOBBY JNR. WHAT GREAT PEOPLE. IN MY OPINION, BOBBY IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY SINGER OF ALL  TIME AND CAN INTERPRET A SONG LIKE NO ONE ELSE CAN. HE HAS FOR SOME UNKNOWN  REASON NOT BEEN GIVEN THE RECOGNITION HE DESERVES BY THE COUNTRY MUSIC  ASSOCIATION. HE SHOULD BE IN THE COUNTRY HALL OF FAME FOR ALL HE HAS DONE  FOR THE COUNTRY INDUSTR 
 I really appreciate the work. I was teaching trough Wayne Grudem's "Systematic Theology" when the footnotes mentioned this book. The approach made me an instant student of the histtory of theology and the church fathers, whereas I was not interested in, nor had the time needed to try to search out what has been said in history on these various subjects. These authors gave me a great foundation in learning to use these various disciplines to do theology 
 "Gargantua and Pantagruel"  A 16th-century medical doctor and Catholic monk, François Rabelais spent decades writing a series of five books, collectively known as "Gargantua and Pantagruel," that became wildly popular for their dark and bawdy humor. To this day, the massive tome still ruffles religious feathers. The current edition of The Catholic Encyclopedia calls Rabelais "a revolutionary who attacked all the past, scholasticism, the monks; his religion is scarcely more than that of a spiritually-minded pagan.... His vocabulary is rich and picturesque, but licentious and filthy."  Sex, drinking, utopian ideals, and heretical philosophy populate this fantastical saga that follows the adventures of a giant and his son. What's even more intriguing are the multitude of hidden messages, Gnostic insights, alchemical secrets, and herbal obsessions (e.g., cannabis) that bubble far beneath the surface of these tall tales.  Hey, the book is dated, no doubt. But it can still get the Church's metaphorical cloisters all bundled up in a ruffle... so don't let the Pope catch ya readin' it, son.

 I was introduced to the Goldberg Variations through Perahia.  I then went back to the Gould interpretations which I found to be skillful, but rather heavy and rushed in comparison.  Murray Perahia is a poet of the piano.   
 Maybe not, but the spirit of the great gypsy guitarist lives on in this fine musician. The ensemble is as infectious and delightful in their approach and execution as the original Hot Club. Taped at an outdoor concert, this project is superb in it's content and technical quality. The audience is totally in awe of this great group. This DVD is almost 3 hours long and full of the exuberance that defines gypsy jazz/swing. Fans of Reinhardt/Grappelli will not be disappointed 
 The book's title and author intrigued me in the first place. I'd heard about Maslow's hierarchy of needs in college. Usually, about half a page or  so was dedicated to it in general college psychology textbooks. What a  disservice! Dipping one's big toe in the swimming pool is not the same as  plunging into it. This book deserves to be plunged into, marked up,  highlighted, commented on, thought about, and discussed. It is brilliant,  original, fascinating, and readable.  I'm not sure how to say it because  there is so much, but I would say that what makes it especially unique is  its study of psychologically healthy people (Maslow calls them  self-actualizing people).  This book will turn your brain on.  I am not a  technically/medically trained person. It took time to read trough  Motivation and Personality, mostly because I wanted to stop and think about  what it was saying. It's not a rush through kind of book. This book, as  well as Dr. Peck's "People of Lie," exposed a whole new layer of  the world I live in. I believe it fine tunes perceptions and make one so  much more aware and alive 
 The details of everyday life in A Confederacy of Dunces add up to a complex picture of New Orleans in the early sixties.  We get a sense, as well, of the changes coming on a broader level:  the old world is passing away, and a new world is coming into being on the streets of the Quarter.  Critical Theory students at Louisiana State University are analyzing this text nine different ways, and finding a multitude of meanings.  They understand how New Historical analysis proves especially delightful and insightful 
 i'm black, have kinky hair, and i've been relaxing my hair for about 25 years. i've used many many types of relaxers to my dismay:- hair falling out, breaking, dry, etc. so i let my hair "rest" for about 5 years then i tried the relaxer thing again after i found phyto. i've been doing my own hair now for about 1 year, and it's been great!- except for the price. my hair still feels as if it has life in it, it it is not breaking, it is not falling out. it burns like regular straightener. i use vinegar to neutralize it, then use the neutralizing shampoo with indicator to check for pink. please, there's not enough neutralizing shampoo to get rid of the staraightener. the price is scary, but i'm more afraid of having my hair fall out and having to fix that.  soon, i'll have to get a hairdresser though, because my hair has now been retaining it's length and growing - and it's harder to straighten it myself. 
 Wow! I listened through the whole album and then listened to it again. I near burnt a hole in the disc because of "Tears Dry On Their Own". I agree that Aguilera kinda waded in the "time warp pool" and it was great but Ms. Winehouse dives all the way in and delivers a more authentic homage to the soulful stylings of a music era gone by. Some might be turned off by the sampling. It's a who's who of samples from famous hits from the soul/ doo-wop era. But I loved it. It's a great album with a classic sound and Ms. Winehouse has the kind of voice that makes you sit up and pay attention. If I had to compare I would say her voice is a combination of Shirley Bassey, Billie Holliday, and Lauryn Hill. It's an amazing album with awesome songs and groovy beats. 
 Death Race 2000 is a film where a cross country race in which points are gathered by running over pedesterians on the road.  It is a very dark and very sick, yet very funny at the same time.  I especially like a pre Rocky Sylvester Stallone as one of the contestants who probably enjoys the race too much.  This movie goes to show that you do not have to spend a lot of money to make an entertaining film 
 The book is about a girl named Hilary, who is a neo-Nazi, who gets in a motorcycle accident and goes into a coma. In the coma she slipped into a dream of someone else's life. The some one else is her hospital room mates life, Chana. Hilary sees into Chana's past, when Chana was a young woman who lived through the Nazi reign of terror and survived. The story is told by Chana and Hilary. 	The author did a good job making the book a page turner because of the conflicts and dramatic situations that occur throughout the story. It was very compelling and was able to draw readers of both genders and all ages into the book. The author uses a creative narration style. She goes from Hilary's mind set to Chana's. It is a good way to narrate the book with both stories told simultaneously. I was able to relate to some of the feelings that both Hilary and chana felt during the book. I could with relate with Hilary because of her hatred that comes from annoyance with her mother. I could relate with Chana when she cannot understand why something is happening to her when she did not do anything wrong and when she felt hatred towards God because of what is happening to her family. If I had to give the book a rating on a scale of one-to-ten, I would give it eight and a half because the beginning was a bit confusing when I was introduced to the characters and all that is going on with them. The middle of the book was also a bit boring because the surroundings in the book don't change quite as often as they did in the beginning and the same thing happens to chana day after day. I really recommend reading this book because it gives me both points of views, one of a modern-day neo-Nazi and also what it would feel like to live through Hitler's reign of terror 
 A great classic cult movie, estevez, i really remembered him in this. Shot in downtown Los Angeles it definently has a very LA flavor, a native would understand what I mean. The whole thing with the aliens, the punks,and mexicans, homeless guys, and the classic car, with a nuclear ray in the trunk, very LA. The loser jobs, and the shot out to scientology in the end was great. The humor in this movie is too much, the scene where he's eating dog food and asking his parents for money. Classic 
 Released in 1979, Richard Pryor's first concert film is a landmark of comic brilliance that he never could surpass -- though "Live on the Sunset Strip" certainly has its moments. Pryor sets the Long Beach theater ablaze with a rapid-fire array of personal and social observations that made him one of America's most incisive humorists. "Live in Concert" remains the ideal showcase for his unique talents and the best way to remember him 
 Bean faces the world in a more personal way than ever before.  I liked the conflict Bean explores within himself.  While Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon provide the reader with a satisfying conclusion, this seventh volume leaves you yearning to read the eighth 
 I bought these for my dad for xmas... he loved them....they are so soft and very high quality 
 I have been listening to this CD since it was released. Sure, I am a huge Fleetwood Mac fan and a fan of Lindsey's previous releases, but Out of the Cradle... well, I connected with it completely! Perhaps it has something to do with both Lindsey and I coming to grips with our fathers' deaths. I can't say for sure, but this CD touches my soul.   I do NOT care for This is the Time. I skip it every time and have eliminated it from personal recordings, but EVERY other song on this CD brings tears to my eyes. Lindsey and I apparently have very similar experiences growing up and dealing with our fathers' passing.   Perhaps this review is too personal, not revealing much about the music itself. For that, I apologize.  Anyone that loves Fleetwood Mac should adore this CD. It is consumate Lindsey, the driving force of the later Mac.  Thank you, Lindsey, so much, for pouring your heart into this recording 
 Great study material - very difficult read, but a must read that should be taught in high school.  Buy this if you support free trade, less government, and the American dream. Beware, this books represents everything a liberal opposes, ideals which are deeply hated by those who support liberal gods like Barak Hussein Obama and Miss H. Rodham 
 Let me begin by making it very clear that this is neither an instructional manual, historical view of absinthe, or a trashy neo-pagan text equating alcoholism with spirituality.  "Absinthe" is a brief and lucid illustration of an absinthe bar in New Orleans in the early part of the 20th century.  It captures the psychology of absinthe wonderfully, especially the poisonous absinthe of New Orleans, and the beautiful torment of a person enjoying its spell.  The work is typical of a Crowley short story he decided to transcribe from one of his diaries verbatim, and his characteristic oscilating precision tempts the reader into experimentation.  "Absinthe" is absinthe from the inside of a drinker's putrefying brain.  By no means am I discouraging the exploration of the drink.  Like most things worth trying, the risk is negligible 
 Very, very good introduction to databases. I'm mostly self-taught in the DB field, and felt that although I knew and understood most concepts at a reasonable level, there were a few bits and pieces missing. I bought this book in the hope that it would help me find those bits and pieces, and wasn't disappointed. This book would be excellent value if it cost more; at it's current price it's mindbogglingly good value 
 I have an infant in-home daycare and needed a quad stoller for my four babies.  When I first found these connectors, no one could tell me if they would connect two tandem double strollers together.  I asked every store in town almost (some didn't even know what they were!). I just decided to buy them and hoped that they would work.  So I went out and bought two Kolcraft Lil' Limo strollers, not knowing, of course, if it would work or not.  I'm happy to say that they seem to work really well!  I did have to buy a second set, though, so I have five connectors on mine(couldn't find room for the sixth one).  Just lock the two inner front wheels so they can't turn and you're off!  It is a little hard to turn corners(just take them at a wide angle), but otherwise it works great!  I ended up spending just under [price] for the total cost of it, much less buying an actual quad stroller.  I hope this info will be helpful to someone else also. Good luck 
 'Kotler on Marketing' provides a concise overview on modern marketing principles. Despite the condensed nature of its content, many illustrative examples are included throughout the book. It serves well as a great 'appetizer' for readers who are interested in marketing 
 Alan Lawrie and Robert Godwin are to be commended for assembling this fine volume on the Saturn V. The Apogee series is the best set of books on space ever assembled, and this volume documents an often overlooked part of the Apollo program, the booster development and history of the Saturn V. Although the earlier Saturns are mentioned in passing, this is essentially devoted to the larger Saturn V.   The book details design and history of all stages and engines by serial number. All stages including test stages and battleships are detailed as are all test runs. The technical data including configuration changes are well documented for all engines and stages, and the history of the test areas and test stands are also addressed.   Despite the fact that a large part of the book is a historical stage by stage accounting, the book is still quite readable and enjoyable to a space enthusiast. Certainly, this is not a book for the casual reader, but the Apollo-phile will love the newly revealed information that has been unearthed for the first time in thirty years.   Also included is a DVD which features even more technical and production data in PDF format, as well as wonderful films of Apollo stage production, testing, and the Apollo 11 launch, the last four minutes of which are synchronized with the MOCR audio recording. The editing of the videos is a bit choppy at times, but the material is so good that I can't imagine any serious complaints.  This is a great volume, and I highly recommend it to anyone with a deep interest in space. 
 A well documented book, that is slow going at the start,but gives adecent report on the IWW.  I think the author was a little weak on the genesis of the union, but he gives a good feeling for the times in the blow-by-blow actions by and against the IWW.  The book was written in the late 1960's, but really has a conservative edge more like you'd read about the 1950's.  A good primer on the IWW--it got me interested in finding out more 
 Pursuing a college degree in my late 30s, I found this book to be superb in every way. It reveals how little almost all students know of how to study and reach their academic potential. Have never been disappointed with any of Buzan's books 
 This is the last recording of the Trio as we used to know it, and I love it. If you are a Brad Mehldau-fan only because he occasionally covers Radiohead, this might be over your head .But if you loved PLACES or Elegiac Cycle and love the original compositions that one can find on all of Mehldau's previous releases, go for it. These songs are truly beautiful and as with all of his originals: they grow on you intensly. Jorge Rossy plays his [...] off here. If you loved Art of the Trio, this is a gorgeous swan song for the first Mehldau Trio which should not fail in your collection. 
 This book reminds us that we can all make a difference.  John's candid and entertaining personality.  His book is a written account of one man's journey from corporate bureaucracy to making a phenomenal change in people's lives. Dennis J. Schleicher Author of an explosive and controversial memoir; Forbidden Love with a Married Man; E-Mail Diaries  
 i have never had an experience on amazon like this before! arrived so quickly that i didnt even believe it had come until i opened the package and saw that it was indeed what i ordered. amazing service!!!!!!!! 
 Anyone who is into hypnotherapy should read this book.  Three people suggested I read this book when they learnt I was studying Hypnotherapy.  Dave Elman was certainly a head of his time and is still unfortunately under rated.  Hypnosis is more than having someone close their eyes in a comfortable chair.  Hypnosis occurs when suggestions are believed wholeheartedly 100%.  Like the book suggests, it is a beautiful natural state that should be learned from the inside.  Unfortunately there are too many people just learning about it from the outside and are afraid to use it.  
 Wedding Blessings is a lovely book to give or own. I bought it looking for readings to use for my wedding and found much more. A beautiful volume of verse that will soften even the hardest of hearts and move you emotionally. 
 The Musician Institute's books tend to be very useful, with superior lay-out and graphics. the approach  is just right for popular music performers. In my opinion, "Harmony and Theory" is a winner. The first half explains the basics of music notation, intervals, scales and chord formation. I already had a decent background in music theory so it is hard to tell how easy it would be for a first-timer, but on this book the subject looked very clearly explained. Very important: Every chapter  has a number of exercises (with answers at the end of the book), so a reader can apply each new concept as it is presented. The second half, exploring harmony, was gold! The content is based on the diatonic rules, but also covers virtually every exception you are likely to find (and apply) in popular music. Because I was already familiar with most of the topics, I read many chapters in a single sitting, but I would recommend this book to be approached by a new studentas as a "course" : one chapter at a time, and be sure to do the exercises! Pick up your guitar and piano and play the chord progressions, chapter by chapter. feel the sounds and then go read the "logic". music is primarily about emotion, no doubt about it, but the analytical understanding of its principles can be so much fun and will arm you with more tools to express your own artistry. Very useful and I am sure it can benefit many musicians 
 Pasqual's is kitty-corner across Water Street from the St. Francis Hotel in Santa Fe; we time our trips to get into town late at night, but before the St. Francis' bar closes, so we can check in, grab a quick drink, and then roll out of bed the next morning and hit Pasqual's for breakfast.  Tamal dolce, big mug of coffee, newspaper, see if the rocking horse is still in the second floor window of the store across the street (hasn't moved in four years, so far, and counting.) We love Pasqual's, its food, its Ann-Arbor-in-the-Southwest feeling ... and the cookbook is a nice souvenir thereof.  The recipes? Well, plan on mail-ordering a lot of different kinds of chile powder unless you live in New Mexico.  Great stuff, though, if you have the ingredients and the patience 
 What could be funnier than the premise that God has his own little plot of land (doesn't it all belong to him?) which keeps getting moved around to make way for yet another fruitless dig looking for gold where none has ever been found. Set in the old (1920's-30's)poor south, poor farm owners dependent on their share croppers working their farm which provides them all a living because the resident farm owners are too lazy to farm and too busy digging for gold, the property is all pot holed from past digs and God's cross that indicates his ownership keeps getting moved around when the patriarch of the family gets a new inspiration where to dig and it is usually right where the cross has been relocated. Lust and greed, longing and jealousy, violence and avarice, faith and hope, all in one story. Erskine Caldwell was a great writer, this and Tobacco Road are hoots, great actors star in this flick. Of course it is slightly sanitized from the actual book but it's still pretty faithful to the story line.  
 I really enjoyed this novel. All the characters were unique. I dont konw, everything about this book just worked for me...right down to the description of the pies Agnes would bake...yum. Its horror suspense, religion meets quantum mechanics. An ambitious novel in which I savored every moment. Junior Cain was a great villian.  
 Steve's Reiki products are a wonderful gift to the world.  I started my Reiki path with the "traditional" day school and expensive level 1 attunement. Most of the class time was spent on politics and differing "histories" of Reiki. I was surprised at how little of the actaul Reiki practice and "hands on" there was.  I had been a natural energy healer for years and some of the stuff that they taught really didn't make sense to me, based on my many successes with energy healing.  So instead of staying for the 2nd say - I bought Steve's 3 books and 4 DVDs (level1, level2, master, and psychic attunements) and loved them them. The attunemants are at least as powerful as the in person one I had, and I am VERY sensitive to energy.  After Steve's attunements and books I have a definite "feeling the flow" of Reiki every time I invoke the power.  Steve's books made so much more sense than the "traditional" school to a healer like myself. It is obvious he really understands the energy he works with and the true power of intention.  Highly Recommende 
 The new Jeff Bates CD, Leave the Light On, was delayed several times before it was finally released in April. Bates decided he wanted to do fewer songs on drinking and more on love and relationships. Some things are worth waiting for! The CD is packed with the kinds of ballads and love songs that were just made for Bates' deep, sexy voice.  A new version of "Long Slow Kisses" makes the first track and is followed by the remake of a Craddock classic "Rub It In." Bates helped to write several of the songs on the CD. "No Shame" is an upbeat love song and the title song, "Leave the Light On," is made even more romantic by the deep richness of his voice:  "So baby, leave the light on I wanna look inside your lovin eyes And watch you when you breathe So leave the light on  When you're making love to me."  "One Second Change," is the first single and Bates claims it's his personal favorite. It's the humorous story about life in jail and how difficult it is finding work as an ex-con and the final song, "Mama Was A Lot Like Jesus" is about a poor backwoods woman, like his own mother, who could "make a bag of groceries last two weeks" and always gave forgiveness and love.  "What I Know" was recorded live. The song simply tells about the end of a relationship:  "I remember when you left I recall you made as hell I know where you told me to go Oh but I went somewhere else."  The audience gives a lasting applause at the end of the song. Many listeners will find much to cheer about with this CD - Bates has the ability to write and sing songs that everyone can identify with - either in finding love, losing it or just enjoying it while you have it.

 Well Walter Brennen should be in every home, it would have to come under  the heading of naration, Listen to the message within they are funny, tear  jerkers, so readily able to relate to. I remember when I first heard these  they were on 78's, boy am I glad they reproduced these as it would be a  shame not to give other generations the chance to hear such tracks.Just  think they are the very best, and I know of a lot of people that love the  opportunity to listen, it gives such enjoyment 
 Sabrina Petra Ramet is by far one of the most respected authorities on the subject of Balkan politics. Her skill as a political scientist and her sheer knowledge of the area and the topic come through completely in this volume. That this book got a glowing introduction by Dr. Ivo Banac - another great authority on the 20th century history of the Balkans - is a testament to its value to the literature.  In reference to the previous reviewer - this is an account that is not at all biased. And Prof. Ramet can hardly be blamed of warmongering. If lamenting the indecisiveness of the world community to react to attrocities and war crimes not seen since WWII is warmongering, then I don't know what isn't. Prof. Ramet is spot on in her analysis. I warmly recommend this book to anybody who wants to really learn about what once was Yugoslavia and why it fell apart. 
 A brilliantly written autobiography by an academic, who leaves her conservative Christian upbringing to discover that one can bring meaning and "significance" to one's life without the security and structure of organized religion. Written with wit and charm, she takes us on her own journey past the nihilistic despair that often is associated with existentialism, to a wonderful place that is tender and life-affirming. Her last chapter, reflecting on aging and mortality, may be her best. It may not be an easy read, but Hazel Barnes tells her story without a hint of academic hubris. A must read for anyone wrestling with the angst, it is a privileged peek into the life and mind of an extraordinary human being 
 I loved this book. The first few chapters were dedicated more for metaphysical stuff, but after those there is some really good information in this book, to those who are open in their trains of thinking. This is my favorite book thusfar regarding this subject. It has the most information, I have found in one spot. This book touches many subjects such as Nibiru, The Annuaki, timelines in history, and other interventions in our history. The author often asks what most people don't. This talks about forbidden history, the effects of other cultures on ours, and how all of man-made religions were made. A Great read 
 This book is touching, heart-breaking and most of all, realistic. I could not help but thinking how would I feel if, as a little girl, I would have been torn away from my culture and my recently-deceased parents' world to live with relatives in an unknown, mysterious place on the other side of the planet. That is how much impact the book has-- you feel the pain, love and feelings constrained by cultural norms that every character is burdened by.  What is wrong and what is right takes many different meanings.  The book makes you reconsider values that are culturally accepted but that go against the human spirit.  How hearbreaking it must be for a parent to cut all ties with a beloved child because of a marriage against his/her wishes?  As a reader, you can't stop thinking about that either 
 Being a person who works and speaks with at-risk students (who aren't these days) engaging their culture can be one of the most frustrating yet rewarding experiences.  It is difficult keeping your message relevant.  This book was engaging with its useful information and insights.  It has helped me look at what I do differently and has changed the lens in which I look at things.  Highly recommend it. 
 I can't say I find Toole's writing to be flawless; he strikes me as someone who had a hard time presenting more than one fascinating character per story. But there are certainly some vivid, wonderful moments here, and the detail - about boxing and about life on the fringes of society - is certainly memorable.  The two stories that make up the movie "Million Dollar Baby" are both here, and if you like that movie, they are both worth a read. Clint Eastwood made some interesting adjustments to them, but much of what Toole wrote is in the movie. 
 Reach454 could possibly be the BEST thing that has ever happened to music. Not only is this CD the freakin best, they rock in concert to. Be sure to get this CD and check them out in concert! I love these guys. If you buy any CD this year, make sure it is Reach454's!!! 
 This was the first movie to be shot of the six films. Since this movie has barely any violence in it and only occasional very mild thematic elements in it. This movie should be fine for kids ages 10 to 21 years of age and older. The reasons why I recommend this for ten and up is because the gags used in this comedy movie are the old school slapstick gags that have been used since 1950s and earlier. These old school gags may be to confiscated for kids under the age of ten to understand. The other reasons why I recommend this movie for ages ten and up is there are a few brief scenes thrown into the movie occasionally with the use of Champaign and other alcoholic drinks.. In this movie Inspector Closeau is hot on the trail of a notorious criminal. known as the Phantom. Can the young detective catch this thief who has been dogging the police for twenty years? Find out in the hilarious funny conclusion. 
 It was really good, it gives you an idea of what the other J.D.Robb books are like if you have never read one before,this one is very short, but enough to get you hooked. I have read all the in death books, they are great!!!Thank you S.C 
 If you're in a hurry--or you're like me and you tend to fall asleep before you take your makeup off--keep these by the bed!  They're so wonderful and soothing, not too dry/wet, and not thin.  Makes you look forward to your new nighttime routine!  Clean skin--fast 
 I love Tracy Hogg! All of her books are awesome helps! Her advice is packaged common sense. She has helped me be an aware parent, so even if I go against her recommendations (which I have often done because nothing is set into stone), I am aware of the possible consequences.   To be honest, I had to read it four times to really get all the information I needed. However, by then, her techniques were so ingrained that I could then help other moms with their babies.   Tracy does not say that all babies fit into one of the five types; she says that many are more than one type.   She doesn't just give lists of things to do. She gives examples and tells stories, and it's up to you to figure out how that applies to your baby.  As with any advice, you must take into account your baby. AND, don't feel guilty if you decide to do things a different way. Her basic techniques are awesome tools to branch out from.  BENEFITS *I taught my baby how to go to bed at 7pm, instead of when she wanted to-- at 10 or later! *My baby has known how to put herself to sleep since she was 2 months old! No rocking or walking around with her! *Once I started the routine, my baby slept 6+ hours at night. And I've been getting a full 8 hours of sleep for months!  If you invest yourself in her techniques, you will see the benefits. And trust me, your baby will be the envy of the neighborhood. This is the case in my experience, and my sister-in-law's. You just have to read it more than once. But really, that will save you time in the end! 
 I saw the title of this book and read the review while searching for a Scott Hanh book - Lord, Have Mercy: The Healing Power of Confession.  I ordered it and it lay in my study for a couple of weeks until I decided to read it.    Unlike the many books I have read, this one touched the depths of my heart.  I would read a few pages and put it down, not wanting to read the details of this genocide. I am a practicing Roman Catholic and I had to pray and ask God to forgive me for my thoughts and feelings on what took place in Rwanda.  I cannot imagine the pain Immaculee and the Tutsi's suffered, but I am encouraged by her faith, trusting at all times that God would take care of her and what was left of her family.  To forgive is easier said than done. When I read that you took Felicien's hand and said "I forgive you".. I was crushed completely, tears poured down my face and I begged God to help me to forgive as you have forgiven.  This is truly an AMAZING book, one that I would read over again to keep me focused on what is really important in my life.   Thank you Immaculee for the heart rending details of your life, by writing this book, you truly made a difference 
 I am so glad that I picked up a copy of Allergic to Pets?  The book contains lots of great information about pet allergies that I haven't read anywhere else.  My husband and son can now live with our adorable "Jake" and the visiting "grandkitty" Gus!    Jake's mom 
 Gary Zukav and Linda Francis did a wonderful job in bringing those who have a hard time feeling and dealing with their emotions a powerful book that will help you journey "from your head to your heart."   This is a great book for people who feel a lot of anger, who try to stay in control, and have difficulty relating to others from the heart center with genuine authenticity. If you tend to run away from your feelings, only to find yourself feeling unloved, or thinking you are unlovable, than this book will help you with the many diagrams and self-help techniques. From sex addiction to drinking too much, to using outward activities to not deal with your emotions, The Heart of the Soul will help you uncover and notice what is blocking you so that you can embrace your truth, and learn how to express it genuinely from the inside out.

 My dad has had this edition on his desk for many years. I think it is the best all-in-one edition of Tolkien's classic fantasy novel 
 Clear and to the point.  Every yoga student should read it, particularly if they want to start their journey into themselves 
 Gosh! This is for people who count, what else does a combinatorist do? Before people dismiss me as somebody who don't know hoot about math: I took a class with Prof. Stanley (the author) in college, and I had actually used vol 1 as a text. The material is highbrow (I agree on the 'hardcore' math observation) but the main theme of the book is how to 'count' -- needless to say not in the sense of everyday counting, but in the sense that 'topology' is 'coffee-to-donut transformation' and 'analysis' is 'honors calculus'. You have to know how to count, and comfortable with combinatorial proof to actually learn from this. I like the fact that Prof. Stanley asks for combinatorial proof to some known results, marking them as unsolved -- he really elevates the status of combinatorial proof, a method many dismiss as 'handwaving'. There is a number given to each exercise, according to the level of difficulty: [1] for trivial, [5] unsolved. I saw a professor who worked in differential topology for 40 years refer to this book -- and first year undergrads thumbing through the pages for exercises marked [1] and [2] to solve in spare time. This is a book for all levels of mathematicians: I am sure even the armchair amateur mathematicians can grasp some of the materials after a hard day's thought. I dont see this book as any less than a definitive text on enumerative combinatiorics 
 I found this book to be really interesting except for the fact that every now and then the co-writer 'Willian Baker' would talk more about himself than kylie, more about his super hero 'Boy George' than Kylie and reveal anecdotes of his adolescence that really aren't to the point. If we wanted to read a review on William Baker or Boy George, we would have bought their own autobiographies but we bought one called 'KYLIE : La la la' and expect it to be about her. I thought the parts she wrote were most interesting and I loved the pictures. This book is done tastefully and isn't the smut that some have blasted it to be. I live in Australia and the cover of my copy is different but the content is all the same. It's a fantastic testament to her career and really shows in visual form the history that has been her performing life so far. A great companion to any album or concert release, I found it most interesting and I good read 
 Heard the taped version of WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE by Harold Kushner, a Jewish rabbi . . . although written some 25 years ago, it is still amazingly relevant . . . and, in fact, it was reissued in 2001 with a new preface by the author.  Kushner originally wrote the book when faced with his own child's fatal illness . . . it deals with death and, also, with other situations where evil enters our life . . . though it gives no easy answers, WHEN BAD THINGS got me thinking about with this one particular bit of advice . . . he urges people not to  ask why all the time, but instead ask this question: What can  I do now?  What Kushner has to say applies to people of all religious  faiths . . . I urge you to get a copy of this short book . . . like me, you'll want to go through it more than once.  There were many worthwhile tidbits; among them: * God never gives you more than you can bear.  * We can't make sense of God's thoughts by saying it is God's will.  * Things of nature don't make exceptions for good people.  * We suffer because we misuse our power to choose.  * God intervenes when in a tragedy, he takes ordinary people and has them behave in an extraordinary way.  * If you know somebody who has been hurt, reach out to him or her.  * People don't want theology, they want reassurance.  * When we most need it, God gives us more strength.  * You have no control of the past. You have a lot of control over the future.  And, lastly, this one: God has given us the tools to live meaningfully in an unfair and  unpredictable world.  
 I love this book, & I carried it wherever I go. Stefan Zweig is the greatest writer I ever known. His stories are so intriguing it's hard to put it down. His writing skills are so lively that even though his books are translated, they are still extraordinary works. But I must point out that in the case of "letter from an unknown woman:, Jill Sutcliffe translated & brought Stefan's work to life so much better than E & C Paul. I have the 2 translations & I have to say Jill is a much better translater in Stefan's work. I love all the stories in this book, & I hope Jill will translate more of his work. His books should be the must read books in class. 
 The use of an Integrated Development Environment [IDE] for a user to learn a language in, and to then program within, is well known. Microsoft has made powerful IDEs for its languages. And the open source Eclipse can be used for Java. Along these lines, Ducasse offers his book. It teaches Smalltalk using the Squeak IDE.   The twist is that Squeak uses the visual metaphors of robots and robot factory, to convey the crucial concepts of objects/classes. As Ducasse explains, Squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger. So a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital, given her limited background and possibly limited attention span.   Squeak uses Smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language. If you come from C++, Java or C#, you may be struck by its simplicity, compared to the oodles of classes and notational intricacies of those languages. Which of course also makes it easier for a young student to learn Smalltalk or Squeak itself.  I wonder a little about the book itself, though. A motivated high school student could easily use it. But for some younger students? In that situation, it may well be that the book could be best directed at a teacher, who can then instruct from it 
 The Brothers' Grimm wrote beautiful fairy tales, and they can be enjoyed by all ages.  I think I enjoyed them most when I read them to my own children, but I have read them again since, and enjoyed them again.  I read this collective edition in order to get all of them at one go, so to speak.  The Brothers' Grimm were not writers by profession.  They were scientific philologists, but decided to make up a collection of folktales.  They spent thirteen years gathering the tales from various sources, and then put them down in writing in order to preserve them.  Everyone knows these tales, but to name a few - The Frog Prince, Rumplestiltskin, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty.  These tales have endured and been loved for many years, and Disney has made some very memorable animated movies out of quite a few of them.  Read them for your enjoyment, and to recapture  a little of your lost youth 
 This is an awesome book! Has beautiful patterns and wonderful wearables anyone can make. Newbies should not be intimidated by it, these are pretty basic stitches for the most part.. 
 this came out when i was still in high school...whip smart lyrics...blazing fast riffs...this is a great album...precursor to 'No Control' chronologically and musically; and, i think a better album...i find myself hummmin songs from this album even today...especially good tracks are 'Forbidden Beat,' '1,000 More Fools,' 'Pessimistic Lines' and the title track 'Suffer' though the entire album is worth a listen...this is still a 'punk' album as it seems later stuff drifts from the punk format 
 When you are very young (I think back on those days), your skin cells in the epidermis are constantly in a state of rejuvenation. The skin renews itself approximately every 28 days. As we all age, this process can start to take twice as long. So, skin cells start to build up on the top layer of the skin. This causes a dehydrated, rough and dull complexion.   Slower cell production, free radical damage and the breakdown of collagen and elastin encourages those little wrinkles to start to appear. You can start to use a vitamin C skin cream and hope for the best, but really you are still fighting all those dead skin cells which can clog pores and promote sebum build up (the cause of breakouts and blemishes).   The best skin care regimen also includes exfoliation, topically applied antioxidants and sunscreen! Try the Vitamin C cream by Avalon Active Organics and CoQ10 Facial cleansing Crème.   All the Zia products are most impressive. I'm quite in love with all the products I've tried so far. The Fresh Papaya Enzyme Peel is no exception.   This is a smooth earthy almost scent-free green mask contains papain that is activated with water. Papain is a protein-digesting enzyme that dissolves dead skin cells without disturbing the live, healthy ones. It is found in unripened papaya fruit.    It is all natural, non-abrasive and is an exfoliant. It removes the dead surface skin on your face to give you a more even texture. Most traditional scrubs are too harsh and use granules to strip the top layer of skin, healthy cells and all. This can result in irritation and over-production of oil and even scarring.   You cleanse your skin and then apply a small amount to your damp face. The enzyme is supposed to stay active for up to 1 hour. The first time you use this, you leave it on for 5-20 minutes. Then you increase the time to 40 minutes, etc.   Before rinsing, you reapply some water and massage gently, then rinse off with warm water. It is recommended for use at last three times a week, but is gentle enough to use every day.   You will notice a difference and a more vibrant look to your skin after using this product a few times. I've noticed that in dry weather the mask tends to dry a bit on my face, so keep a spray bottle of pure water handy to keep the mask moist. This is not a mask you want to let dry.   When you go to a spa, they always have a steamer on your face during the enzyme treatment phase, so you might also want to use this product the same way. Just don't let this get in your eyes! Putting a saturated cotton pad over each eye might help.  It contains: Green Papaya Concentrate, Sunflower Oil, Unfiltered Hawaiian Honey, Citrus Oil Extract, Vitamin E Acetate, Ceteareth 20, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea.  Helps to repair sun damage, remove age spots and other discolorations.   Also try the Zia Acne Treatment Mask which can be used for spot treatment or to help control breakouts. It contains Colloidal Sulphur, silica, Camphor and Tea Tree Essential oil. Look for the Pumpkin Exfloiating Mask and Citrus Night Time Reversal.   Zia Products are cruelty free!    This product is a must for all skin types!  ~TheRebeccaReview.com 
 If you have ever wondered about the Mossad and how they came about this will answer all your questions.  A really good book 
 I put this book to use the very same week I bought it. One of my creative writing students at the local university where I teach was having problems writing dialogue. When I met with him, I brought along my "Building Blocks" book. In addition to what I had to say, it was great to offer him the advice of some of my favorite writers, including Charles Baxter, Amy Bloom and Dick Bausch. I felt as though I was leading him down the corridors of the ultimate English department, and every door was open.   The excerpts are golden nuggets of writing wisdom: short, conversational and enlightening. I'll definitely consider using this book as a required course text in the future. It covers everything I need to address in my writing class: point of view, voice, place and setting, character, description, use of language, dialogue, etc. - without sounding repetitive or pedantic. The variety of voices, perspectives, interviews and excerpts keep the topics interesting and fresh.   As a writer myself, I've found that the book offers more than just "building blocks." I turn to the book when I'm feeling stuck, and when I need to get a fresh perspective on the craft. It's often helpful to remind myself that even the best writers experience roadblocks and frustrations. Unlike a lot of books on writing, this one tells it like it is, while at the same time offering helpful strategies and techniques -- from writing a novel for the first time to paragraph breaks and punctuation.   
 Excellent, easy-to-read book about how modern humans dispersed and populated our world. Tracks human colonists to Australia, across the bitter Russian steppe to Siberia and Americas, etc 
 First, let me state I have often judged other people by their past actions. Was Kazan wrong for providing names of alleged Communist Party members? I can't answer this, and you shouldn't answer it, not until you read this book! Yes, Kazan named names. Yes, he did ruin the careers of certain artists. Please, don't judge until you have read his story! This is an honest, masterful show business autobiography! Kazan was a fearless, authentic, visionary director. He admits to adultery, poor parenting skills, and using people for his own good. Alfred Hitchcock allegedly tortured Tippi Hendren during the filming of the THE BIRDS by having the little critters thrown at her face in repeated attempts. Why? To foster the character's psychological terror. Would you want that man house-sitting for you while you are on vacation? Hell no......Can Kazan be rewarded for his art, yet  escape judgement for his past behavior? You decide, but read his story first! Kazan's films never shirked from dealing with pressing social issues, yet the movies are visual poetry. Hey, you try to make a movie about corruption on the Brooklyn docks! Oh, and make it a heart-wrenching allegory, a love story, and a black-and-white masterpiece! One other thing, don't forget that the Mob basically controlled the docks at that time and were not too keen on being protrayed in an unflattering light!!    One of Kazan's gifts was his tremendous empathy. Kazan the author allows us to develop this same empathy. He is a wonderful story teller, relating anecdotes about personalities like Tallulah Bankhead, Tennessee Williams, and Brando.  Granted, he worked with a pantheon of American writers, like Tennessee Williams and John Steinbeck. Granted, with source material like A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and EAST OF EDEN, and actors like Jessica Tandy, Marlon Brando, and Julie Harris, he clearly had an edge over other industry directors.   Again, before you judge his character, read his book, sit down and watch his complete output of films, and draw your own conclusions. Don't let Nick Nolte or Ed Harris, both of whom refused to applaud or stand when Kazan was given his lifetime Academy Award, decide the issue for you. This book should be a must-read for young people considering a career in film or theatre 
 I thought that this book was exciting, and I couldn't get my eyes off the words. I felt like I was a spy following Bobby's life. I recommend this book to poeple who like adventure and people that are clever. In this book Bobby was clever and also calm at the same time. I also thought that the protagonist was also careful.For me, I thought that the antagonist, Bobby, was causing problems for himself. I thought that the antagonist was dumb because everyone wants a happy life. The antogonist is making his life harker and people want their life to be easier 
 One of the more interesting characters we encounter in this story is Tinker Burns, a spry old ex-French Foreign Legionnaire and maybe the only living American veteran of Dien Bien Phu. TWILIGHT AT MAC'S PLACE is one of the best novels I have read about espionage and Washington intrigue 
 Harper's is easily my second favorite fashion magazine, second only to InStyle.  It is great and packed with great fashion.  It actually does have some good articles too that I thoroughly enjoy reading.  (The articles are MUCH better than the ones in Elle.)  If you can only get one sub, get InStyle.  If you can get two, get InStyle and Harper's Bazaar.  It is well-worth the money 
 Author Sandy Polishuk reflects the determined efforts of her subject Julia Ruuttila - people who fight for their beliefs with little reward but the satisfaction gained from doing something right.  The plight of working people is keenly felt as Ruuttila recounts the suffering at the hands of mill owners and indifferent public officials.  Some things don't change.  Whether you're a logger whose job is gone because companies decided to overcut forests, a tech employee whose job has gone overseas, or a retiree whose lost savings filled the pockets of self-serving CEOs, we all have lessons to learn from Polishuk's book and Ruuttila's story.  It's a startling insight into our past, and a sober vision of our future.  This is oral history at its best and most respectful 
 This is one of the finest WWii movies as it focus' on leadership. The DVD version enhances the realism of all the scenes 
 Would highly recommend this book to all!  Covers many sound Design ideas, a must have for any designer or architect 
 Well, I'm going to keep this short; I don't see any reason of boring you. I had high expectations for this book. I heard that it was one the best vampire books ever written, that it was scary, and so on and so forth. Anyway, this isn't scary at all, nor was it meant to be. Instead, this is a sympathetic view of vampires and shows how they live their lives. I have no problem with this, and applaud Rice for doing something original. I love the detail she puts into the scenery and makes the New Orleans of the past come to life with ease. Also, the character development of Louis is great, and the detail in other character (though coming from Louis's view point) is good. Unfortunately, the story suffers from Louis's narrative. He complains too much, continually debates if God and Devil are real or not, complains that he always wants to die but then admits every time he doesn't have the guts to do it. Really, if I wanted to listen to whining and complaining, I would listen to emo. Fortunately, this is a relatively short story; only about three-hundred and fifty pages or so. Another thing I like about this book is that it is a fast read. One could be done with it within a day to five days (just depends on how fast you read). All in all, this is a pretty good story. Not perfect, but definitely worth its price 
 Now that "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" has been ended since the show took it's final bow in 2003 (*sniffle*), fans will really get a kick out of this blast from the past -- Buffy style!  While any and all Buffy novels that have been produced since 2003 must choose  a position on the Buffy timeline with which to create their new tale, it is pleasantly refreshing to see one that hails from the early season 2 timeline.   "Bad Bargain", in relation to it's timeline and setting within the Buffyverse, actually takes place during Season 2, before Angel turns evil. By my estimate, it would need to take place sometime after the episodes "What's My Line? parts 1 and 2" (because we know Xander and Cordelia have begun their secret tonsil hockey sessions in various broom closets), but before the episodes "Surprise" and "Innocence" because Angel is obviously not evil yet.  Buffy novels have evolved beautifully, coinciding nicely with the evolution and sophistication of the show. One of the things I loved about this novel was that it truly represented the whole Season 2 vibe in it's storyline, dialogue, and writing style. It would be easy to read this novel and be able to completely picture it being an actual episode during that season, which I think might have been the feeling author Diana Gallagher might have been trying to invoke. There are many incredible Buffy novels, but at the same time it is not always easy to try to picture some of the stories being an actual part of the Buffyverse. They are fun and entertaining, but also a little constricted with a this-doesn't-quite-feel-like-a-real-part-of-the-story kind of mentality. "Bad Bargain" is 100% a season 2 episode!  Another fun thing about this novel is that it (like all post 2003 novels) has the advantage of knowing where things are going. It can easily slide into it's place in Season 2, while at the same time constantly foreshadowing things to come. Jonathan and Andrew make an appearance, while Mayor Wilkin's darker dealings are alluded to -- and all without breaking it's own storyline. This book doesn't bog itself down by trying to do nothing but foreshadow, but it does throw enough little winks our way. The actual story, which has Buffy dealing with the bizarre and increasingly alarming behavior and physical symptoms of students and teachers who have seemingly come into contact with a mystical ailment contracted from various items during the school's fundraising bargain sale, is admittedly cheesy at times. However, then again, so were parts of season 2!  Bottom line, it's a light and enjoyable read for the average Buffy fan. 
 The ideas in this book are returning to favor -- this time possibly based on serious research 
 The Discussing the Da Vinci Code Curriculum Kit by Lee Strobel and Gary Poole contains three items: a DVD, a group discussion guide, and the book Exploring the Da Vinci Code by the same authors. In this review I will cover the DVD and it's discussion guide. The accompanying book will be reviewed independently.  This curriculum was put together with "seekers" in mind. "Since the primary audience for this guide is the not-yet-convinced seekers, the ideal place to use Discussing the Da Vinci Code is within the context of seeker groups." (10) The emphasis is group discussion such that if the proposed schedule is followed participants will spend about 17 minutes watching the DVD and 43 minutes conversing per session.  The DVD and discussion guide are broken down into four sessions in which Lee Strobel visits some of the historical locations utilized in The Da Vinci Code and interviews contemporary scholars. In the first session, the topic of historical analysis is discussed with historian Paul Maier. The second session poses the question "Can we trust the four Gospels?" to New Testament scholar Scot McKnight. Strobel interviews Kathy McReynolds in session three about the role of women in Christianity and Jesus' relationship with Mary Magdalene. The final session deals with the divinity of Jesus with scholar Mark Strauss.  Considering the proposed "seeker context," the discussion guide is very well done. It provides great questions for discussion while provided many quotes from scholars, Dan Brown, and facts throughout the booklet. In the back of the guide are several appendices that recommend further resources, state the facts, and give arguments for the true identity of Jesus that is affirmed by historic Christianity.  While it's neat to see Lee Strobel "on location," he doesn't really engage the sites he visits, so that seemed somewhat pointless. Strobel is more known for his investigative journalist approach, which he applied well on the DVD. He asks good questions that provoke good responses form the reputable scholars.  The DVD also has some promotional trailers, which could be shown to get people interested in joining the discussion group. The graphics and navigation of the DVD are extremely well done. The DVD together with the group discussion guide make Discussing the Da Vinci Code a thought provoking curriculum that will be useful for seekers and curious Christians alike 
 I love the City. Its particular rhythm and energy is like no other place in the world. 'New York Magazine' captures some of this , and works to be fashionable and fast, glossy and up-to- date, stylish and hip( If that is still the word.) I sort of like some of this, but a lot of it seems to me trivial and idiotic. And a lot of the trendy stuff is just way out of my league. But 'New York' often has wonderful writing. I cite here James Atlas as a particularly good contributor. And it tells you things about the City no other magazine does. Some of those things old conservative me will not read.  But at times there are pieces here that cannot only be 'fun' but give a real feeling why the Big Apple is still the 'Empire State Building( or Flatiron Building) of all the great cities 
 I loved this one better than DaVinci Code. Illustrated version makes it easy by avioiding you to google up every little detail mentioned in the book. A must read... 
 The book has all of the good aspects which other reviewers have given it, but Smith should have given it a re-read before publication. It reads as though he rushed through it to get it on the market, and re-used material from his other works. (He says as much at the beginning and at the end.)  I am pretty sure that he knows that the word "Christ" comes from the Greek, not the Hebrew, (as the text says), and that most New Testament scholars think that Paul did NOT write Ephesians as his very clever illustration on p.24 says. These appear to be mistakes made in the haste of writing. Still, this is a very helpful book, even though it is not quite up to the standard of C.S. Lewis's "Mere Christianity" or even Marcus Borg's recent elucidation of the essence of Christianity. His critiques of both fundamentalism and the modern religion of scientism are on target, and worth the price of the book 
 I was required to read this text for a class.  I would not have normally picked something like this to read for pleasure.  I found that this text is very attention grabbing, and it is extremly informational.  I would recommend this text to others 
 This graphic novel is a wonderful way to tell the stories of operas. Operas have complex plots, bigger than life characters and lots of action. P. Craig Russell captures all of these in his graphic novels 
 This book is my french bible. I use it everyday, especially for my AP French class. It is something I couldn't do without 
 The title track is basically the only "new" song on this album, other than the two instrumentals. If you are unaware this is the soundtrack to MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE, the movie that was actually directed by Stephen King himself. The movie is the balls, man, if you've never seen it. King, notoriously a huge AC/DC fan himself contacted these guys to write a score for the movie that he was putting together at the time, and what evolved was the song WHO MADE WHO.  PISSER! If you think about, this song probably contains the most thought provoking AC/DC lyrics that there ever were. It is based on the movie, which is about an evil spirit that brings machines to life (its sooo good, did I mention that yet?). The song in similar vein basically is about how one could believe machines are taking over but in the end we are human f'in beings for gods sake and how are machines gonna destroy us? WE RULE! WE RULE THE FOOD CHAIN! WE RULE THE FRIGGIN' WORLD! Computers? Computers are fags. They ain't got nothing! That goes for you too robots! By the way, the boys are IN the movie too, as themselves. They actually get killed by the demon (you gotta see the movie man!)  As for this album, it rocks A TON! The only problem is that its all previously released songs from other albums... but hey, casual liteners no doubt will dig. Its like buying a greatest hits almost. The songs are mainly from the eighties (all excellent tracks though) except for RIDE ON, the only BON SCOTT track represented here from Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (that happens to be MY favorite album, you should check THAT out. 
 Oh, what a naughtly little treat this is!  Garbo as Queen Christina does all sorts of stuff that could not have been depicted on screen just one year later, after the Production Code began to be enforced.  She appears to be bisexual: there is an implication of a lesbian affair with one of her maids-in-waiting, and she is clearly having a non-marital affair with her treasurer (male).  On a trip to the country, when she is disguised as a wealthy young man, an innkeeper offers to procure a young lady for her--and does so.  Then she spends several debauched days in a room at the Inn making love to the Spanish ambassador, etc. etc.  Who would have thought that a 1933 B&W film would be so racy!  
 In this book, Robert Hass treads close along the confessional risk line but never quite seems to slip over it. This avoidance is tricky, given the highly personal material in most poems here. (I'd define the CRL as the point at which a poet fails to generate sympathy in the reader when discussing what is posed as personal pain - truly autobiographical or not.) He manages not to trip up by the masterful use of several strategies:  1. Distraction: when approaching the kernel of pain in a poem, he mouths around it, noting with palpable wonder the beauty and strangeness of the natural world before returning to the kernel for another little gnaw. Eventually acceptance - not so much resolution, which is hard to find in this book - is the reward of rationed philosophical nibbling. In poem after poem, Nature is a necessary source of healing distraction, and occasionally so are the imagined lives of other people. What's implicit is a deep sense of trust in the process of healing, which requires time and attention, but not necessarily to the pain.  2. Fluidity: structural as well as tonal. Distracting himself and the reader when things start to sting could very well make for clunky, ungenerous verse, but his casual tone (which rarely if ever asks for pity, instead lingering over what excites his curiosity) somehow brings us along willingly. Even when the interruptions are overt ("Interrupted Meditation", "Regalia for a Black Hat Dancer"), he doesn't derail. Perhaps this is because the reader has been coaxed into accepting Hass's constant shuttle between private musing and scrupulous description by  3. Beautiful, accurate language: Hass has a fine eye, and a fine ear to match. "dragonback of pine", "toss off grails of pure white idly" - the book sings often enough to singlehandedly justify the reader's attention. It's nice that Hass mostly refrains from simply treating his natural materials as springboards for hokey or artificial metaphors - as the old man says in "Interrupted Meditation", Hass doesn't excel at metaphor - but he does excel at bringing non-human life to vivid presence on the page.  This book is largely about overcoming pain - not in the sense of triumph, but in the sense of swallowing, ingesting, receiving, and transforming. The ideas aren't all that big - just big enough to be useful and pleasurable. As Hass navigates his sorrow, we're glad he invited us along 
 Very comprehensive quality handbook. Dealing with the latest tools and techniques and theoritical basis as well. I would have appreciated if some topics were more detailed (ie: six sigm 
 The project was started in the late Nineties but was never completed.  In 2004, the executive producer and Nonesuch Records President Bob Hurwitz came across the unfinished album and resuscitated the project. Twelve very different performers cover some of her best-known numbers, in a dazzling variety of styles: Björk beguiles in her slow, breathy ickle-girl version of "The Boho Dance", Prince wails seductively through "A Case of You", Caetano Veloso gives "Dreamland Brazilian swing", Elvis Costello chews at the tragedy of "Edith and the Kingpin", kd lang epitomises the elegant and witty chanteuse in "Help Me". Such a range of big names - Emmylou Harris, Brad Mehldau and Annie Lennox are among the other contributors - suggests the extraordinary breadth and depth of influence that Joni's work has exerted since the release of Ladies of the Canyon in 1970. Somehow, their efforts fail to cohere. It's partly the choice of songs: an avoidance of the obvious early hits   and a desire to emulate the sophisticated eclecticism of Mitchell's later recordings, which often simply dissipates the subtle sophistication of the original melodies. The best moments bring the individual artists' trademarks to the songs: Caetano Veloso's "Dreamland" has a festival tristesse; Sarah McLachlan's layered, acoustic "Blue sucks the air from a room",  James Taylor's homesick "River" aches with his neighbourly sincerity, Emmylou Harris's "The Magdalene Sisters" blows her own desert dust into Mitchell's laundry lyrics, while "Don't Interrupt the Sorrow" finds jazz pianist Brad Mehldau in Keith Jarrett mode, cycling ostinatos forming a bed for more inquisitive explorations.   Cassandra Wilson's "For the Roses" - one of the few covers for which Mitchell herself has expressed admiration - is sung in a rich and sultry dusk that blows the fading petals of those lovely lines into a warm wind of bass and harmonica: gorgeous, classy and true. If you like Joni's music and you want to make comparisos, you will be disappointed. Please, do not compare ! Listen to this record  just as a new album paying homage to one of the great singer-songwriters of our time 
 If you have studied matial arts, or are in the least bit interested, this book will give you an outlook that you will not see from many of the writers out there.  It provided me with an overview or outlook of the things that had been learned by a person who has studied may different styles of martial arts and who has also been very suggsessfull in his own proffessional carrer. His honesty concerning elements of martial arts that are not usually talked about were very informative and refreshing 
 The most beautiful & easy to understand beading book on this topic I've ever seen.  I love it!  Great pictures & information.  Highly recommended 
 This book is good for people that are first starting out with an interest in the RMS Titanic due to the fact its filled with over 800 questions and answers that covers the building, sailing, rescue, aftermath and after the section talking about the finding of the titanic it goes to the movie facts for a few of the titanic movies 
 You will use this book over and over. I teach gifted upper elementary and middle school drama students. This book is one of my favorites - it is likely to be one of yours too 
 Even though I had questions about some of the assertions in this book, I found the psychological and biochemical research supporting Stout's thesis convincing. I also found her case studies extremely compelling. If nothing else, this book is chilling food for thought and got me thinking about human behavior in a way I hadn't previously. I recommend it to everyone as a heads up about what the behavior you observe might be telling you about people you know, people you read about -- and above all, people you should avoid. I feel better informed, less naive, and, oddly enough, safer because of having read this book 
 I really enjoyed this movie, All the action passes always checking the clock, shows as the desperation is taking a young person who always were correct and nice in an apparent ruffian and bad student.  Very good music and photografy, a detail:  the starring actor like his against figure (a young R Tyson)  have 26 years old each one and they simulate to be 18.   Comment in spanish for people who speak Spanish:  Toda la acción transcurre checkeando siempre el reloj, muestra como la desesperación va llevando a un joven que siempre fue correcto y pulcro en un aparente rufián. Muy buena la música y la fotografia, un detalle : el actor protagonista al igual que su contra figura (un joven R Tyson) tienen 26 años cada uno y simulan ser de 18 
 This is an excellent and needed book in Civil War literature.  Too many folks seem to think the war was entirely in Virginia, between the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac.  In  fact, much of importance took place in the Western Theatre, where one of the principal Union armies was the Army of the Tennessee. It is almost shocking to consider that, until this book, no one had written a history of the Army of the Tennessee.  The army is mostly associated with U.S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman; it was formed from the force that Grant used to seize Paducah, Kentucky, in the early days of the war and grew to the force that took Forts Henry and Donelson, fought the savage action of Shiloh, took Vicksburg, fought the Battle of Atlanta, and then marched to the sea.  The men came from Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, and Kentucky. (There was even a regiment from Nebraska!)  The book starts out very well.  Woodworth describes the war fever in the Midwest which led so many men into the ranks and provided the army with many of its leaders.  He then progresses into the narrative of campaigns, first under Grant, then under Sherman.  As a summary story of the western theatre of the war, the book is outstanding.  Alas, the book is not perfect.  Many have commented on the lack of maps, a criticism I share.  Woodworth's focus is also uneven. At the beginning, the reader is treated to biographical sketches of many of the men who would lead divisions in the army, but this ceases after awhile, and the book is poorer for it.  One could also launch into a small list of omissions and errors, something almost any book has.  But the bottom line is that this is a very well-written book which tells a story that needs to be told.  Buy it, read it, enjoy it.  You'll be glad you did 
 This author writes very interesting works that make you sure to look for more of her titles when you are ready for something else to read/listen to.  
 Our kids LOVE reading this book!!  The get so involved and like the way the words flow from page to page. They bounce up and down and pay close attention 
 This is a great way to study the different elevations/styles that can be applied to the same basic floorplan.  Also a quick reference for the many Architectural styles of the U.S 
 I think this book was a real page-turner, with the descriptions of the chocolates making my mouth water. This story is a suspenseful mystery story with a love story twisted cleverly into it. I highly recommend it to mature kids and above. Overall, this was a great book to read. 
 This is a really great knitting book. If you could only bring one knitting book with you to a deserted island, this one would be it. I think it was originally published in the 1940's, or perhaps it was earlier in the 30's, but its contents are still contemporary to this very modern day. Mary Thomas explains in a very clear and easy-to-follow way all different types knitting patterns that can be used for different results, as well as different ways to change the patterns to suit your needs (ie. different needle sizes, etc.) A portion of the book covers garment construction, providing a good foundation for those who would like to venture off and design a garment of one's very own. I was surprised to even find a section on seamless knitting for sweaters that I had thought was originally a certain reputed knitter's idea and which this book outdates... I guess a good idea will never die, only to be passed down to the next generation... There are also some good sections on shaping and an amazing section providing different ideas on finishing touches for the final product.  I highly recommend this book. Not only will it be an inspiration, but it will prove to be an excellent resource of information that I find myself reaching for often 
 History used to be a subject that one could view as somewhat ancillary, as an interesting subject but one that was not really needed to function in the modern world. One could dispense with studying history and still maintain a proper perspective of world events. Any inaccuracies in the reporting of world events were the responsibility of reporters, and historians were viewed in general as occupiers of an ivory tower. They were held to be trustworthy because not much weight was assigned to their scholarly activities.   In general, this attitude about history and historians is now considered to be a mistake. Because of some very volatile and dangerous events in the early twenty-first century, the study of history should be viewed now as one of the most important, if not the most important scholarly activity. One can easily observe the enormous weight that is placed on events of the past, due in part to the ideological agendas that are deeply embedded in contemporary politics. And some historians have chosen to use historical analysis to justify a political agenda, or have acted as sycophants for the institutions that host them. It would be fair to say that some historians are now viewed with extreme skepticism, and many are therefore looking into the historical record and seeking answers on their own. These historical auto-didactics are hungry for tools of analysis in which to study and interpret past events.   This short book gives an introduction to these tools, and any reader, whether of the afore-mentioned type or not, will gain a lot from its perusal. It gives much insight into how historians view and find sources, and is primarily written for non-experts (such as this reviewer) in historical analysis. Philosophers and economists will also discover how the study of history also intersects to a large degree with their own fields.   There is a wealth of information in the book, and many questions are answered as well as raised. Some of these include:  1. What is the nature of historical interpretation? Can historians put themselves in a position where an historical source can be read without giving attention to the historical context that give it meaning?  2. How can an historical source be characterized?  3. Are historians ethically responsible for the content of their works, and if so, to what degree?  4. Is there any value in oral records for historical analysis? In interviewing?  5. What impact has information technology had on historical analysis?  6. How are archives useful for the historian, and does a given archive, taken to be reliable, expand or shrink with time? 7. Will the advent of software to analyze historical texts eventually result in the automation of historical analysis?  8. How do historians assess the accuracy or authenticity of sources? 9. Does the interpretation of an historical document always involve the determination of its intended meaning? 10. Should "firsthand" reports of events always be taken as true? 11. How do historians compare different sources relating to the same historical event?  12. The authors refer to `reasoning by interpolation' or `by analogy'. What exactly is the nature of this kind of reasoning? 13. When can a historian claim that his analysis is correct? Is there a way of quantifying the point at which enough evidence has been collected?  14. Can participants in events claim any special insight into these events over and above what can be obtained by an observer (an historian) who is not, or has not, participated in these events?  15. Can historians view events and documents from an apodictic point of view, i.e. free from bias and any implicit assumptions?  16. Should historians focus on what people did in the past rather than what they thought or felt?  17. Should historians concentrate on deducing the motives of the people in history from their visible actions?  18. The authors point to the use of fields such as psychology to study the "feelings in history." Could the relatively new field of cognitive neuroscience be used to do the same, or even more generally to study the motives, decisions, and mental limitations of people in history? One could view this use as a kind of "historical neurocriticism" and its use could possibly shed considerable light on how people, through their cultures, construct meanings of their experiences and make history.  19. The authors refer to human life as being "too complex" to be analyzed with historical models. What notion of complexity is being used here, and given current methods for dealing with complexity in model-building, would these be of any assistance in the study of history, especially those that attempt to understand to what extent events are caused by human actions?  20. Should historians focus more on studies of "popular culture" and not on "learned culture", i.e. should they analyze historical events in terms of what has recently been called "people's history?"  21. What is the difference between a `linear' theory of history and a `cyclical theory', and is the former always more optimistic than the latter?  22. Can technological innovations and development be used as a reference of time for historical change, i.e. as a kind of clock or calendar in which historians are to delineate events? Such a calendar would not necessarily be a linear ordering of events like the ones that are currently used. In periods of rapid technological development, time will be more compressed than in periods of slow technological development. History could thus be viewed as moving more quickly in the former than in the latter.

 So you get five film starring this LEGENDARY ACTOR who never gave a anything but great performances... Even in so-so films, Gary Cooper would shine all over with hos leading style... his easy command of the screen... his magnetic persona... his sincere smile and on-screen will that would drive you love him in any character he portrayed.  In THE FOUNTAINHEAD (my favorite here), Gary gives one of his best performances as Howard Roark, an architect (inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright, no less!) who was in a constant battle against mediocre styles. Someone trully creative and visionary who would not compromise. "I don't build in order to have clients. I have clients in order to build!"  But another thing about this film is the eye-popping sets and designs. INCREDIBLE... I still love that building all made of glass!!!!  In SERGEANT YORK, Gary portrays a pacifist (who is enlisted during WWI) who will discover the true meaning of fighting... and what being a Hero is all about. JOHN HUSTON was one of the screenwriters of this GREAT 1941 film who, I'm sure, did back then much more than just entertain. In fact, this is one of the best Hollywood war films during the 40's...   And, of course, with HOWARD HAWKS, you can never go wrong.  THE WRECK OF THE MARY DEARE is a big CinemaScope film where special effects trully shine. Again, here Gary cooper gives a superlative performance.  SPRINGFIELD RIFLE is a smaller Western by ANDRE DE TOTH with another great performance. Here, Cooper joins (undercover) a group of criminals in order to solve a mystery of stolen guns. This is an above average B-movie with a good script.  DALLAS is a post-Civil War drama of a man returning home to seek revenge. Another B-film with a great performance.  This box is worth buying because of two reasons: You get five films (three are trully great, two are trully good) for easily the price of just two or three...  ...then, why not get them all?  
 We're mostly on opposite sides of the politcal fence, nonetheless I love Scott Ott. Take it from the resident leftie at the Detroit News weblog, even when he's mocking us, his humor is at worst wry and his more non-partisan pieces are universally on target and painfully funny. Put this book on your gift list for anyone, progressive or conservative, who's hooked on politics. But caveat emptor, do not read Scott Ott while consuming beverages. I've already ruined a keyboard and my favorite dress just reading his work at Scrappleface. 
  According to Weiner and Brown, their book "defines the ABCs of clearly seeing patterns, weighing choices, understanding trends, getting the future right, making good and innovative decisions about the future, and, indeed, influencing what that future will be." Frankly, my own crystal ball imploded many years ago but, that said, I am grateful to Weiner and Brown for providing some truly unique and thought-provoking perspectives on how to "think [more] clearly in a time of change." Weiner and Brown respond to a number of critically important questions:  1. How can (and do) "personal traps" such as individual biases prevent us from recognizing and then understanding change?  2. How can (and do) "organizational traps" also do so?  3. How can we avoid (or extricate ourselves from) these "traps" in order to see what Weiner and Brown characterize as "The Big Picture"?  4. How can we use metaphors to help us to "see" more...and to see it more clearly?  Rather than "give away the plot" by attempting to summarize Weiner and Brown's responses to these questions, it would be more appropriate for me to provide some brief excerpts from their narrative. In Chapter 2, they suggest: "The important thing to remember is that both trend and countertrend present opportunities for profit. At the fork in the road, businesspeople should not merely ask which is the best road to take. We should also ask how our assets and constituencies can be used to our advantage on either or both roads." Why? "Not realizing that every trend creates a countertrend will leave you confused and surprised by unfolding events and changes ahead. Understanding the existence of countertrends will untrap your mind and allow it to process change much more accurately."   For example, understanding disintermediation which involves bypassing traditional channels for the delivery of goods and services, offering lots more options, choices, and sources of information.  Then in Chapter 7, Weiner and Brown example the mental trap of entropy which can be especially difficult because its requires thought and action which most people prefer to avoid. What to do? "Give up many `sacred cows' and start over...Pick your fights more wisely...Lose the fear of experimenting, particularly with less significant things...Be more aware, active, and informed politically...Give up relying solely on the best practices of others in running your business...[and finally] Stop trying to fit every opportunity or challenge into an old framework."    Weiner and Brown conclude Chapter 14 with a recap, noting that "football is a useful metaphor for how sellers must approach the modern marketplace. There's first down, which is some combination or price, quality, convenience, and assortment. Second down is personalization or customization. Third down is company reputation. Fourth down is the punt (giving up and going on defense), the field goal (a business-to-business strategy), or the touchdown (the relationship)."  Granted, these brief excerpts are taken out of context but they at least offer a sense of how innovatively Weiner and Brown think when focusing their attention on situations and circumstances which seem so familiar that most people give them little (if any) rigorous thought.   To me, Chapter 15 (all by itself) is worth far more than the cost of this book. Weiner and Brown suggest how to manage effectively by "harnessing evolution." Darwin's Theory of Evolution has two major components: differential reproduction and sexual selection. Weiner and Brown observe that a "newer, disputed addition to evolution theory is [in italics] punctuated equilibrium [end italics], which is when a sudden event, such as a natural catastrophe (a crisis) or a mutation (a new development) creates an abrupt new path toward development." That is, it disrupts what is generally referred to as the process of natural selection. To decision-makers in all organizations (regardless of size or nature), Weiner and Brown recommend what they consider to be "the next big management tool." Specifically, the idea of time-pacing which involves "deliberate recombination, procreation, and mutation [in all areas of operation within an organization] at predetermined intervals." Only then can flexibility be the central characteristic of an organization's culture. And only in such a culture can those who share it function effectively at a time "when evolution moves so quickly that it becomes revolution."  In Leading Change, Jim O'Toole examines various barriers to change, suggesting that the worst of them is what he calls "the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom." Presumably Weiner and Brown agree. In FutureThink, they suggest that, in fact, there are no effective barriers to the process of natural selection and that the velocity of this process continues to accelerate rapidly and irrevocably.   One final point. If I understand Weiner and Brown correctly (and I may not), what we do now to avoid or extricate ourselves from the personal and organization "traps" they have identified may not be wholly sufficient in years, perhaps even in months ahead. But at least understanding the "16 proven mental paths to insight and foresight" which they recommend in this volume will help us to respond to change in the future, whatever its nature and extent may prove to be.  
 Ooooh baby, is this a fun book. Five beautiful children are photographed by Penny Gentieu as they interact with their parents. The focus of each photo is the joy-filled face of a child. The children are shown eating, splashing, playing and most importantly, looking into their parents' eyes. The background of each photo is pure color, orange, green, yellow, blue and purple which matches the clothing of the baby and parent. Gentieu's photos glow.      Hey, baby!     Look at you, looking at me,     looking at you, looking at me.   This would be a terrific baby gift or a nice present for big brothers and sisters-to-be. Who doesn't love looking at pictures of precious children? Just imagine holding this book in your lap with a little one tucked in beside you. Children (and babies) love looking at faces. Oh Baby, look at me reading with you, look at you reading with me 
 Okay, stranger things probably did happen in real-life besides enemies  exchanging vital resources while continuing their fight. However, the  motive supplied for the Hagannah's violent intervention was unjustified,  potential of failure high with great risks of exposure.  Secrecy was the  key to the success of the Tortugas players (ie, to get what they wanted and  avoid being exposed for dealing with the enemy).  All the Haganah needed to  have done was make some public exposure, or even give just a hint to make  things hot for the players and all Tortugas players would be stopped cold.   The rest of the book was okay, fast moving and the action sequences rather  lame. That David Spaulding led such a charmed life that his life was  continually spared while Ed Pace was snuffed out was rather hard to  swallow.  Furthermore, no explanation was given about Leslie's mention of  Bonner 
 As compelling as it is informative.  These Titans of Enterprise inspire, fascinate, and fire the imagination 
 A thoroughly researched, highly detailed, and well-written look at a frequently forgotten footnote in football history.  The book puts the merger of the Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers into an excellent historical context.  It should also be a real eye-opener for football fans who only know the NFL as the Goliath it is today.   -- Mitch Teich, Milwaukee Public Radi 
 "...the beauty is in the flaws."          The First Lady of Christian Chick-Lit has done it again.  The second book in this Collection, is about Spa Girl, Morgan Malliard.  Morgan is the socialite of San Fransisco.  Her life consists of expensive shoes and purses and showing off her Daddy's diamond collection to boost sales at his store.        Morgan opens the book finding herself in a scandal that she unknowingly started in She's All That .  As a result she lands herself in the newspapers, yet again.  All Morgan wants is to be rescued by her knight in shining armor, and yet seems to attract just the opposite.  Like always a quick trip to the spa with the girls will solve all her problems.  Little does she know that by the time she leaves the spa her world will be turned upside down.       Morgan, returns to San Fransisco and must pause to find out WHO she really is and WHAT she is really made of.  Is her life really as perfect as she has always been led to believe? Is there more to life than expensive things?  Has anything she done in her life mattered to this point?  Who's will does she need to follow- her Daddy's or Gods?  The answers to these questions are life changing for Morgan.       Billerbeck is first rate in reflecting the main character's view point.  It was interesting to see how Morgan viewed the personalities and the relationships of the Spa Girls. It was quite the turn from Lillie's perspective in She's All That.  There were also a couple of turns in this book I just didn't see coming.  It is always fun to read a book that keeps you guessing.  Billerbeck does a great job of showing that all the riches in the world don't buy you happiness.  Life is not always going to be perfect as determined by the world, yet it will only be perfect as determined by God.  Courtesy of Lone Star Latte-n-Libr 
 "You Can Heal Yourself" is one of two books that I often refer to for emotional healing and clues into physical illness.  This book helped me personally as I journeyed through depression.  Today it is a useful tool in my toolbox as I often refer to it in my line of work.  This book often reveals needed clues to help my clients find the root of their physical issues.

And pleasure it is from start to end pendulum rolls out dance floor rippers and some seriously hard tunes. If you like hard drum and bass this is definately for you...if you are not into drum and bass give this a try YOU'LL LOVE IT 
 Twenty-nine year-old rookie homicide detective Toshiro Mifune has his gun stolen.  Agonized with guilt Mifune goes out in search of his gun.  Day and night he pounds the crowded post-War streets of Tokyo until he learns that his gun is being used by a "mad dog" that is growing increasingly violent with each crime.  Mifune must stop him.  This was my first Kurosawa film, so I can't really compare it to his others, but I thought STRAY DOG was very well made.  The script was well paced, the acting made me smile and the camerawork left in in awe.  I actually paused the film a few times just to look at the beautiful image on the screen.  The movie is also intriguing, thanks to it's realism and use of actual locations in showing Japanese life after WWII.  Inoshiro Honda (GODZILLA) had to secretly shoot the sequences of black markets and flophouses cause they were real 
 This is Bernard Malamud's best book. It is written with a kind of understated beauty . The story of Frankie Alpine the assistant who works in the grocery of Morris Bober , and connects himself in suffering with Jewish identity contains the heart of Malamud's 'universalization of his own Jewishness'. The book is a moving story, including the love story between Alpine and the elderly grocer's daughter. Malamud's tender and humane ironic tone informs his warm relation to his characters.  One of those rare books which seems to fully make concrete an abstract ideal of human goodness. 
 My story is about LeBron James and how he grew up. When he was a freshman in high school he won tournament MVP for the state, which is amazing. 	The beginning starts at his childhood and continues so on. My favorite part in the book is when he's a freshman and he played football. Their team made it to state. They lost in the finals, but he got All State. That means hes one of the best in the state. Later that year he made the basketball team. They made it to the state finals. They won and LeBron got MVP. That happened for the next three years. 	Ryan Jones is a senior editor at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine. He lives in New York. I would recommend this book to sports fans that like LeBron James. The age and gender I would recommend this book to is ages 13-35 and boys.   
 Death in Lacquer Red by Jeanne M. Dams is the first entry in the Hilda Johansson series about a Swedish maid in 1900 South Bend, Indiana.  This doesn't sound like an interesting premise for a mystery series, but Hilda is a strong, sympathetic character.  When Hilda stumbles upon the body of the next door neighbor, she's drawn into a murder that's implicating foreigners by a police force that wants to quickly hush up the death.  Hilda has an overblown sense of justice and wants to prove that the poor Chineseman who's been accused of the murder is not lynched for a crime he didn't commit.  She overcomes her fear of Catholics and losing her job to find the truth.  Dams does a nice job of writing accurately about the times without making the book feel like a history book.  She weaves the prejudices against foreigners and Catholics into the story naturally.  It's a very relevant book for the times that we're living through now.  The most unbelievable part of the book was Hilda keeping her job when all is said and done, but for that I'm grateful, because it means that there is a sequel 
 Very written and directly accessible to the non-specialist general reader, Hydrogen: Hot Stuff, Cool Science by Rex A. Ewing offers an informed and in-depth study of hydrogen that can be easily grasped by the non-scientist with an interest in this subject. Hydrogen introduces the reader to the every aspect of the manifold uses of hydrogen, what the chemical really is, where hydrogen comes from, and how it works as a fuel. Ewing presents a remarkable reference for anybody without much scientific background with a true interest in hydrogen and all of the extensive and innovative uses for it. Also very highly recommended reading from Pixy Jack Press is Rex Ewing's "Got Sun? Go Solar: Get Free Renewable Energy To Power Your Grid-Tied Home (0965809870, $18.95) which he co-authored with Doug Pratt 
 This book discusses the abundant gifts that God has in store for us each and every day. The author not only urges us to discover these gifts in our own lives, but also shows many examples in these devotions. By living in an  expectant fashion, we discover and are amazed at what God does to  personally affect our lives. I would recommend this book for all who  believe in God. Busy people who would like to take the time for a short  devotion will appreciate how quickly it reads -- but the message of each  devotion will touch hearts 
 Of course, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an excellent book, one everyone should read but don't buy the paperback. The print job is sadly lacking with it's variations in the ink from dark to light, poor paper quality, and tiny jammed together font size. My fingers smeared the ink while I was trying to hold the little book open. Better to find this at a used book sale or yard sale 
 While this documentary could have been an incestuous, self-congratulatory promo piece for director Stacy Perralta, he manages to present himself and his childhood pals (the title's "Z-Boys") from an outsider's point of view. Perralta attempts to show a "warts and all" portrait of he and his group. While there may be "sins of the past' that remain out of the camera's view, these are secondary to the wider scope of the film.  DOGTOWN AND Z-BOYS focuses on the history of skateboarding, from its surf board origins to its explosive rebirth in the mid-70s. Perralta (co-founder of skateboarding company Powell-Perralta) and his hometown cronies comprised "Team Zephyr" and helped revolutionize the "sport" of skateboarding. Told in vignettes scored with an incredible soundtrack of guitar rock (the music rights probably quintupled the flick's budget), DOGTOWN AND Z-BOYS occasionally resembles a bigger budget "Bones Brigade" video. The form lends itself to fleshed-out chapters of information along with occasional skate breaks that highlight the poetry of the sport.  The skating speaks for itself and calls attention to the narration of Sean Penn who trips over the overwrought prose of writer Craig Stecyk. Far too often, Penn sounds like he's reading his Ninth Grade term paper on skateboarding.  Perralta's film moves at a good clip, only bogging down towards the end with long-winded vignettes focusing on he and two of his other Dogtown chums. Yet, at no time does DOGTOWN AND Z BOYS ever wear out its welcome. If anything, I'd have liked the film to go farther into the post Z-boys era and the metamorphosis of skating 
       I am a 15-year-old and have been interested in drawing comic book art for a few years now. I started out buying How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way. It was really good, yes because well-established comic book artist wrote it, but it didn't really grab my attention. Then, I saw How to Draw Cutting Edge Comics. This book really got me into drawing comic book characters. Then, I saw that he had a new book, How to Draw Cutting Edge Anatomy. I was especially excited because drawing the actual people interested me more than drawing anything else in comics. I quickly looked through it and bought it. I have never looked back.        It honestly taught me so much. It starts with skeletal structure which, I believe, has to be the first thing an artist needs to learn before learning the rest of the anatomy. Then, it goes on to basic muscles. After this, it has many sections focusing on different muscle groups and parts of the body. While the pictures do help, it was what he wrote that helped. They way he explains what the muscles look like and how they move is very understandable. I loved it.       I have been looking for an anatomy book that's at least moderately clean - I'm just not comfortable with drawing nude figures; I just want to draw comics. There are not very many comic book drawing books out there that focus on anatomy and are still modest. This one does a great job of it and it is one of the cleanest ones I have found. Some of the pictures of the girls are seductive and immodest, but I try to not focus on that. There's so much more to learn in this book!        The styles of other how-to-draw-comics just didn't catch my attention like this one did. You see, I don't want to develop a Stan Lee or George Perez style, I want my own. Learning from an author that isn't an established artist in the comic book world seemed to ease the pressure of making my style like his. All I can say is that I love this book. It has its flaws, yes, but every how-to-draw book has its flaws. I read this drawing book, and others, but especially this one, to help me draw better. What can I say? I love it 
 I haven't tried any of the recipes, but absolutely LOVED the essays in this book.  Most of them are hysterically funny.  I've never read any of Mr. Conroy's novels (though I've seen the films) -- but I certainly plan to read them now.  The book also makes me want to visit the Carolinas.  
 And it has made all the difference.This is a great album indeed.Jimi was moving on and into a new soulful blues path.He did the flower-power gigs,because he enjoyed it and he could sell it.He was just in the process of rediscovering the blues,that had influenced so many rock artists,without them even knowing it. His musical magick lives on 
 I feel I need to write something on this album, artist.  I'm 50 years old tomorrow 11/23/05. Leon has been the inspiration of my musicical enjoyment for over 30 years.  I was recently asked that if I were to be put in confinment and were to be allowed 1 CD/ALBUM to listen to for the next 5 years of my life that I would choose this one.  I do a radio show here in southeast Alaska on public radio KRBD Ketchikan. I've been doing it since 1989.  Leon Russell is the heart of my music.  His soul,his voice, his song writing  will live on forever as long as I'm still around.  I've been lucky enough to have captured him live in Seattle with Edgar Winter a couple of times and even danced to his music...Too cool.   Thank you Leon....How many days has it been since I was born...How many days till I Di 
 This book was very helpful to me as a beginning teacher.  I highly reccomend it to anyone who teaches writing for any subject 
 I derived many things from Ernest Becker's "Denial of Death".  I went from agnostic in my outlook about the universe to Christian, realizing that "The Denial of Death" is fundamentally an anatomy of evil, a diagram of man's skewering in a universe he finds wholly incomprehensible.  Taken on its own, this book can be cause for serious reflection of one's ambitions in life; Becker carefully reveals what man is really up to throughout history.  The unfolding horror of the book's pages begin to describe a hopeless and paradoxical situation for human life.  Anyone who allows Becker's thoughts to sink in...to really understand what he is saying will, in my opinion, continue to seek out answers about human nature and the condition of our world.  The relevance of "Denial" is that it can be applied as a psychoanalytical tool for viewing mankind through the ages, from primitive being to Donald Trump.  Some argue that this book is too pessimistic, too dark of a view of mankind.  Again, very correct! Becker is, in my understanding of this profound book, simply describing the mechanism of evil, where man goes awry and why he continues to act in ways contrary to what he knows best.  Anyone who has read The Bible, cover-to-cover, will find in these pages an intellectual's 285-page descripiton of evil, based in human nature, acted upon by man in his world.   There are few solutions to the portrait of evil that Becker so carefully paints for us.  The pan-drippings, so to speak, of "The Denial of Death" is Becker's next and last book, "Escape from Evil".  This makes perfect sense, as "Denial" is a careful and horrifying analysis of ourselves against the universe.  What Becker describes in "Denial" is so penetrating that little hope is found in "Escape".  One year after reading "Denial" I was convinced that man, indeed, destroys his world because of his very nature, his false illusions about what is meaningful.  Where "Denial of Death" gives you a diagram of what's wrong with man, The Bible offers hope only through the Christian God--man is born in a world that will corrupt him--Becker explains the details of this corruption.  The Bible asks, in essence, for you to reject your nature and live "the narrow path".  Becker shows you how wide the evil path is and why man conceives of it. I am a student of human nature.  My only "escape from evil" was a complete paradigm change for man.  Man, burdened with his ego and a zillion personal attributes, is condemmed to live in a world of paradoxes, a world of hypocricy and a world of perpetual angst and agression, both starting and ending at zero.  Man exerts great energy going nowhere, like a hampster running fast on a wheel.  The illusion he props us is that he is actually moving, but Becker takes us outside of the cage and shows us what is really happening.  The integrity and truth of a book lies in its inability to be reconciled, just like the true artist who asks more questions than he answers.  You owe it to yourself to read this and then try to reconcile it in your mind.  "Denial of Death" is a needed rung on your ladder of intellectual evolution.  Some are beyond the material and already understand it.  Some will be paralyzed by it, others will deny it...but if you integrate what he is saying, and attempt to construct your life knowing that you are living a paradox, you can step up to the next rung on your ladder and move your mind forward.  The next rung on my ladder of evolution was a spiritual awakening towards God.  What book can do that 
 I am a very picky reader. Not many books get to me but this was one of the few. I laughed, I cried, and I read non-stop. If you like fiction/fantasy and you like AD&D ( Advanced Dungeons and Dragons)  this book is for  you 
 This is the best book on child development I have ever read.  Dr. Hymes was my college professor and his understanding of children's needs at different stages is amazing.  We raised our 2 sons with his insight and  have personally proven these principles to be highly successful.  Dr. Hymes  helped me to understand the very critical stages in a young child's  development.  He fully explains in a clear and entertaining way, the  child's need for security, autonomy, and inititive and what obstacles stand  in the way of achieving these.  This book is the very best and I recommend  it to every new parent 
 I have to admit, I hate princess romances for the most part.  Most of them are filled with ridiculously whinging heroes, and they have two plotlines:  the hated arranged marriage, where it turns out the prince is really some hot dude; or the kidnapped princess saved by the grotty--yet surprisingly tender--mercenary.  Dodd kicks all those stereotypes to the curb.  "The Prince Kidnaps a Bride" is not helped by a fluffy cover of a girl holding up a beautiful dress.  The heroine is headstrong and just a little naive.  She is also willing to say the word--which Amazon won't let me write--but let's just say, think of a rooster crowing, and subtract "a-doodle-do."  This book is hilarious, witty, and a rousing read.  Because after you get to the rooster crowing, trust me -- you'll want to see that table, too 
 I bought this CD in 1990 after seeing the movie.  I was looking for one song that was in the film.  I went through the disc quickly and when I didn't find the song, I was so annoyed that I didn't listen to the CD again for a while.  (The missing song was "Weinerschnitzel" by the Descendents, by the way).  When I did listen to it again, I discovered music from many essential bands of the pre-Nirvana era; back when grunge was still an underground thing.  The tracks on here are incredible.  I think the Pixies' slow version of "Wave of Mutilation" is worth the purchase price.  It is completely different than the Dolittle version; so calming and breezy.  Then Soundgarden's "Heretic" jumps out at the listener, a wonderful track that epitomizes their Louder Than Love era.    The Bad Brains and Henry Rollins explosive cover of MC5's pre-punk anthem "Kick Out The Jams" is a needed track for any punk fan.  Top off the CD with Peter Murphy (Bauhaus), a Sonic Youth song from their Goo era, and some Concrete Blonde; it was had to be disappointed in this CD that was missing a few great tracks.  Basically, if you like the early 90's alternative scene, this is definitely a CD to pick up 
 This fabulous collection of images lends itself to many uses.  As a middle school math teacher I have used this book as an artistic supplement to geometry lessons.  As an artists I have used this book for inspiration for quilt design, stencil design, and needle work design. As a mom I sit and just color for stress reduction. Quite a lot of uses for just about (...) 
 I love this collection of songs.  There are several that stick in your ear long after the music is played.  Johnny Tarr even had my neices and nephews singing and asking me to replay that song over and over again.  Swimming in the Sea is another of their and my favorites.  The haunting, "I thought I knew you" reminds of 'someone I used to know.'  A good mix of tunes that will keep you humming for hours.  Gaelic Storm is one of my favorite bands and if i ever get the chance to see them live, I'm there.  
 I'm not sure how long this will last. Had it on for nearly ten hours straight and never saw the battery bar on the iPod dip below full charge. Used it for the next three days on and off for a total of maybe 6 hours and still didn't see any change in battery level. Would be nice if it came with a car charger if your traveling to the outdoors and won't have a pc to charge it through 
  This one if functional (has been using since a month), but looks very flimsy. Probably becauses of low weight, which is a plus 
 This incredible account of the two year adventure of a father and son in paddling 12,000 miles down the west coast of the Americas must be read to be appreciated. It was inspired by a similar paddling, accomplished 60 years earlier by Dana and Ginger Lamb (from San Diego to Panama) and recounted in their classic ENCHANTED VAGABONDS (now out-of-print). For those interested in human endurance and cunning in the face of overwhelming adversity see the Lamb's spirited QUEST FOR THE LOST CITY, described by the NY Times as a "sort of overland Kon-Tiki.&quot 
 Somewhere in this book the author uses a word to describe somebody who is in love with words, it should be written above as a title to this review because the author is a prime example, but  unfortunately I have forgotten it already along with a whole plethora of other fascinating information. So in a few months time I may have the pleasure of reading it more carefully a second time, whilst the first time reader will be indebted to him for his many instructive references to Marcel Proust whose name might well have been included in the list of subjects covered by the title, had this not made the title too cumbersome. 
 My daugher is 2yrs old and really enjoys getting to put a sticker on the chart next to the potty. It has helped a lot with her potty training since she doesn't get a sticker unless she goes. I would recommend the book to anyone 
 Now you see it is one of my favorite books, it kept me going and I found I couldn't put it down. It was somewhat short though and I found myself a little dissapointed that it ended so suddenly but I would gladly read it over again.   It is of a girl Wendy who discovers a pair of sun glasses that let her see an unknown world of great adventure and in which she discovers new friends and learns not to judge someone on their looks. 
 Seierstad writes a compelling book about cultural and personal differences.   I actually can read between the lines the efforts of a man who is trying to find his own voice in a system that does not work as we think.  With Seierstad's candid observations, one might feel compelled to shout and scream... but yet any body who does not have the opportunity to stand out and taste criticism will shield from taking actions.   I loved the way the author was able to clearly state facts and jumped into her emotions (and I can only imagine the shock). Most people will fail to recognize the main character's effor to provide for an honorable way of living, help his younger wife to read, and do his best.   When we read the book without judgement, we are able to understand how we differ. I actually think I can understand why this or that happens.. Reconstruction after war is hard, anybody who has had to live and survive a very strict regime builds up character or shuts down. I usually found myslef thinking what would I do as any of the character's personalities emerged... it was fascinating.   I smiled at the young teenager boy... thinking of my brother, then my son..  of my feminist father and how he would try to emancipate his daughters and truly believe the guy is making a difference in HIS culture which might be less shocking than if we took someone from OUR culture to make drastic changes.  The insecurity portraid by the female characters also happens to so many people (mostly woman who chose to stay at home to care for kids for a while) who leave the competitive world to nurture others.   but most importantly, the book is a gift of courage on everyone.. to tell how they see it, and not pretending to live in a perfect world. I admire their courage, from the comfort of my house, with water and electricity, glass windows and no fear that I'll get bombed.   I couldn't put it down...   IF you want a TOTAL SHOCK, READ IT WITH 'EMERGENCY SEX'(and other desperate measures 
 As a child, I grew up in a family that devoured the stories of James Herriot. You will laugh, cry, smile at the stories that are shared with the readers. At times I feel like I am right there by his side as he operates on an animal. At the present, I am re-reading the whole series. PBS movies are good-but not as good as the books. This books deals with the beginnings of his vet practice, and I get a kick out of James being an "uncle" to a dog and a pig 
 A review of famous modern architects' buildings, starting with H.H. Richardson and ending with Wright's Usonian houses. Shows how each's ideals regarding architectural honesty are revealed and often compromised in their buildings. The theme is really not important, as long as it provides a framework for discussion of construction methods, which is the real heart of the book. (For the sequel, another theme, the influence of industrialization, is added to the discussion.) You'll learn interesting facts: Greene & Greene's Gamble House is post and beam only where it shows; FLW's Martin house owes its distinctive style to framing with structural steel and brick piers. Combine this with the second volume, and you'll be familiar with all the important Modern buildings and architects 
 James Ellroy is likely America's best active crime fiction writer.  In his dark and disturbing vision of Los Angeles in the 40's and 50's the bad guys are pretty bad, but the cops are even worse.  Partially based on real incidents, and interwoven with real historical characters, Elrroy finely crafts a thrilling fictional story.  If you liked the movie, you will like the book even more.  Although quite long, I couldn't put this book down until I was finished 
 I could not wait to start this book and see where our heroines were headed. Again, I was not disappointed 
 I read Lucky Child before First They Killed My Father. Although I had her first book on my shelf, I needed reasurance that everything would be "ok" in the end. It also prepared me for what I would read in the first book. I'm not recommending that you do so, but I'm a very sensitive person so that is what I did. So let me tell you, I think about both these books on a daily basis. I read books one after another and fairly quick, so it is rare that a book will stay with me for months after I read it. The courage Loung Ung has is astonishing. She is not just someone with a story to tell, but an amazing writer. I highly recommend this book 
 It's been many years since I've actually indulged my love for cooking. My food preparation had long been limited to two choices: (1)add Lawry's seasoning salt and bake/fry/broil, and (2)fast food. Recently, I became reacquanited with my inner chef and became obsessed with cookbooks and books about food. I came across More Home Cooking during one of my recent trips to the local bookstore. I was intrigued by the tag, "A Writer Returns to the Kitchen." (I love good writing and I love good food.) The chapter titles sounded promising: Why I Love Cookbooks; The Case of the Mysterious Flatbread; How to Cook Like an American; Turkey Angst...Plus, the book had recipes! This was clearly a writer who had more than a passing interest in food; this was a true believer. So, what of this book? It's simply wonderful. It's not a book you rush through all at once, but rather one you can carry with you and savor in those brief windows of time throughout your day: during lunch break, while waiting in a line, in the car wash...Colwin's writing is so well-done it seems effortless and comes across as a conversation with an articulate friend who loves to talk about food. She's opinionated, good-humored, and honest in her essays about the merits of certain foods, the drawbacks of others, advice about food and living, and events from her own daily life. From her chapter entitled, In Search of Latvian Bread, regarding her attempt to replicate this bread:  "The results were, to my mind, mixed. An Estonian came for supper and said it tasted exactly like the bread he had had in Moscow. I was not sure that this was a compliment. A dancer friend, also at dinner, tasted it and said he liked the other bread (miche from the greenmarket) better. My husband said that it was wonderful, but that I should have added rye flour. The Estonian said this bread would keep forever. I was not sure that this was a compliment." It's these little moments about her curiosity about food, her willingness to experiment, and her genuine fondness for food and the people it nourishes that make this book one you'll read through once and then pick up every now and again, just to enjoy a chapter or two once more. Incidentally, it wasn't until I was nearly finished with this book that I read the "About the Author" paragraph on the back cover. That's when I learned that Laurie Colwin had died in 1992; I felt a flicker of sadness. I would certainly have looked forward to future "conversations" with this engaging writer 
 My brother-in-law had loaned this book to my dad, but I found it extremely handy for someone in my situation: a nearly-graduated college student getting ready to join the "real world." From buying a car to getting out of debt, Clark Howard shares practical tips to help you save money and be a smart shopper. While I may not get rich from reading this book, it has definitely helped to steer me in the right direction 
 Before the extension the movie was 4/5. After the extension the movie is still 4/5. The additional 8 min. didn't add that much more to the movie that we didn't already know about. Just minor slow paced extensions of sceens that were in the previous cut. There's a reason why these extensions didn't make the final cut in the theaters, because they wern't necessary for us to gain any more understanding. Do yourself a favor and avoid buying this edition if you already have the original copy and get the Blue Ray high-def when it comes out soon 
 This album is not actually agreatest hits collection because not all these songs are hits!! The 'Boys' took 5 songs that got radio play and plugged holes with songs of lesser notice but all good material and excellent musicianship ( Brian Jones was still w/ them, that figgers ). If you want a quality album that is a greatest hit #3 then this is for YE. Buy it - enjoy it 
 I purchased this in conjunction with the DVD to use for a paper I wrote about "Into the Woods" and its commentary on children's literature and the very notion of childhood. I'd urge anyone to buy the book if they love the show and are interested in looking at it line by line to absorb even more clever subtlties. Great for any ITW fan who is looking to delve deeper into the show's magic and message 
 Transcends blues to be just a fun, sad, uplifting, great cd.  Recommended for anyone 
 Some of the episodes have not been digitally enhanced, so the film imperfections are apparent.  Otherwise, if you are a Babylon 5 fan, this is great 
 I was impressed with this film. The actors Orson Welles, Edward G. Robsinson, and Loretta Young live up to their names and don't disappoint. Edward G. Robinson in particular plays his detective smoothly.  Robinson stars as war crime investigator Wilson, sent to hunt down a concentration camp officer (Welles) who is hiding in America. The storyline basically works like an episode of "Columbo" - we already know who the criminal is, but the real drama comes from the criminal and detective looking and trying to outfox each other. Wilson is in particular an interesting character who definately knows his stuff. He isn't a Sherlock Holmes kind of detective who can see a footprint on the ground, tell how tall the man is, what he was wearing, what he was smoking, and what kind of pizza he likes - but he isn't stupid either.   The film overall isn't a classic and its story may be simple, but it nonetheless is a good watch. Even for a one-time viewing, I would recommend it 
 My children and I love to flip through the pages and look at all the differant types and species of animals. And I know that as they get older, their interest in this book will not wain. They will continue to derive wonderful information from it. Great Book 
 This is an excelent book on political theory and also one of the best defenses of democracy as a political system I have ever read. Specially good it its chapter on "guardinship", contradicting the most common arguments in favor of different "tutors" of the people 
 This is a broad collection of readings that exposes the roots of what is now postmodern urban theory as seen by most of the major thinkers of the LA School. It is an intellectual contemporary of Soja's Thirdspace, and predates Michael Dear's "Postmodern Urbanism" by two years. This was one of the first coherent statements of purpose from LA School, and as should be expected from a nascient effort it is a bit scattered and not very convincing for the reader who is not aware of the ontologic project that motivated the collection. In short, this volume was a concerted response to the reassertion of cultural materialism led by David Harvey and others against the wave of postmodern theory that swept urban studies following the publication of Soja's "Postmodern Geographies" in 1989.  For those who find Keno Capitalism an interesting metaphor for the city I strongly suggest "From Chicago to LA" (Dear 2002, Sage,)which is a much more mature statement from some of the same authors and a much stronger collection. I give this book high marks more for its value in tracing the intellectual geneology of the authors and for its importance as a respose to David Harvey's critique of Postmodern Theory than for any of the articles in particular 
 I loved this book and read it a few hours.  It gives a very quick biography or a dozen or so female pirates throughout history, accompanied with some great, colorful illustrations. I really like the pictures. It is not a serious or scholary book on the subject, but rather a fun and campy look at a bit of history.  I'm not so sure how accurate the accounts are, but it is an entertaining read none the less.  I would recommend this book for highschoolers as a way to introduce them to and spark some interest in interesting characters from the past.  The author includes a list of further reading at the end of the book if you find your are further interested in reading up on pirates 
 What a beautiful and heartbreaking movie.  When I first saw this at the theaters, I swear I wasn't only crying - but sobbing.  I still sob watching this moving movie.  This was an original idea for a movie at that time; Bob Jones is dying (played by the gorgeous Michael Keaton) and his wife Gail is expecting their first child.  So thinking he may not be around long or at all after the birth, he tapes his life for his child to look back on as they get older.  I don't think anyone in the universe could watch this dry eyed.  He goes and revisits the house he grew up in; he teaches his son how to shave; he gives all the fatherly advice to his future son that kids learn from their living parents.  It's a beautiful, heartwarming story that is acted well and will flood your house.  You must see this if you are a fan of a love story between husband and wife and father and baby. Look out for Queen Latifah as Theresa, the nurse and listen out for the beautiful score in this movie.  
 While omissions in a short volume such as this are inevitable, it's nevertheless interesting, sometimes surprising to see what Lewis chooses to comment on versus what he chooses to leave out. The contents and index are available on Amazon, so I won't litter this review with the details. But do take a look at the TOC/index to make sure what you're looking for is here! Nevertheless, Lewis's writing is remarkably clear and his analysis is insightful and always interesting. A very worthwhile collection 
 Still one of my favourite films (though if truth be told the list is getting longer by the week and will soon become a worthless measure of a films greatness)  No idea why some people hate it, as I find the writing some of the best of recent years. Genius is a term too frequently thrown around and I guess it would be unwisely used here, but I do think the writing in this film borders on genius or at least ingenius.  So there 
 Digital Domain is James Cameron's special effects firm in Venice, California. The book is a story of their challenges and success in creating the new worlds of techno-media where we are immersing ourselves within the story because of the power of special and visual effects. Titanic, Terminator and more -- are used as examples. Visually gorgeous, great cover and lots of terrific information. Focuses JUST on Digital Domain but does introduce us to the world of visual effects that is being created as you read this by the melding of art and science in the new multimedia environment. Beyond the technology there is a brilliance that is influencing all of our communication today -- from the rise of the SCREENAGER who uses multiple communications devices and techniques to the interactive experience that even shopping has become. Shoppertainment, infotainment, edutainment and more -- all are being changed by firms and innovators like Digital Domain and ILM of course. Not easy to read but great to thumb through and then focus on later 
 I was only about eight or nine when I first learned about Stephen King. I saw a copy of Desperation that one of my family's friends was reading and I was just fixated on the cover art. That was what started it for me with King. I didn't read Desperation until some five or six years later while I was in my freshman year of high school. I had read a few King books by then (Needful Things, The Shining, Dark Tower I and II, It, 'Salem's Lot) and was fascinated with Desperations weird story. Being a fan of gore and just plain strangeness, Desperation, in short, delivered. I picked up a copy of The Regulators (Don't read The Regualtors without first reading Desperation) shortly after, read about 140 pages, then put it down. I don't know why really.  A few days ago, I saw the Regulators sitting on my shelf and decided to read it. I was soon absored and addicted to it just as I was to Desperation. The novel has the same characters from Desperation (except they have different roles and different ages)and the same nemesis, Tak. In short, the story is similar to Desperation, except while Desperation takes place over a day, The Regulators' story takes place in a few hours. The Regulators is pretty violent. It's probably the most violent of any King book I've read yet. Numerous Characters are mutilated in various ways from double-barrel shotgun carnage to catci-suicide.   Though I really liked it there were some flaws. It really didn't feel like Stephen King wrote it. I don't know why, I just got that feeling. Yes, there really isn't a lot of character development, but that doensn't bother me as much as it might others. Some of the parts are, well, kinda cheezy if you ask me (some of the things the characters say in the situation really bothers me at times), there are some gross, akward things (Seth's bathroom visits), and the ending is sudden, but really gorey. It won't end in the way you probably think it would. It's a happy ending though (in a way).   Overall, it's not King's best, but far from worse. Very far 
 Worth every penny of the price. Good for a strong foundation in German grammar and phrase construction 
 My seven-yr-old requested this CD after hearing it at a friends house.  It is a fabulous CD to be listened to anytime of year.  The songs are funny and are easy to sing to.  Highly recommended by this mom 
 This is the best source out there innovation, in my opinion.  This book is a good, clear and concise statement of what is necessary to be successful in innovation.  After working in this field for about 16 years, and learning through trial and error, you don't have to follow my experiences to find out what is necessary.  Read this book and practice it - focus on it - leverage it and you will be successful.  As mentioned in one of the reviews below, the best chapter is number five which describes the process of creating a innovation value proposal - the NABC process.  This acronym stands for Need, Approach, Benefit (or value to the customer) and Competition.  The authors not only clearly define how to do this, but they give examples, and explain clearly what is necessary to do this effectively, e.g. iterate, iterate and iterate, and e.g. "watering holes" (their term for learning communities).  This is only one example - discipline 2 - provide value to the customer.  The rest of the four disciplines are handled similarly.  My suggestion is that if you are interested in learning more about innovation but have time constraints, and can only focus on one source, this is it.  The best source out there for innovation 
 this cd is love in the making........what a great cd.....the brooklyn  bridge outdid themselves time after time.....and this lovely record proves  it...........it has all their hits and will take you back to an era when  words and music gave you the feeling that someone cared, if you loved each  other, you could make it through the roughest times......johnny mathis,  move over..just a tad.......i'd forgotten....my heart melted as these tunes  flooded my memory......enjo 
 I've read Sarah Mlynowski's four previous chick-lit books (Fishbowl being my favorite) so I was eager to read her newest one. I picked Me vs. Me up on a Sunday for a trip later that week and read the entire book on the plane (between going and returning). I found it to be a very light, very quick read, which is exactly what I was looking for.   In addition, it was an interesting concept for a book: a character that gets to live two lives - see how her life would play out if she chose one future versus the other. (I think we've all at some point in our lives wished we'd have that option to see where the "what if" takes us!) It was definitely fun to experience it through someone else.   All in all, Me vs. Me was not my favorite Mlynowski book, but that's probably because I really loved the split points-of-view in Fishbowl and Monkey Business so much. However, the switching between Gabby's two lives worked in a similarly enjoyable manner. I definitely recommend this book to her fans and to those looking for a cute light and quick read 
 This is a wonderfull book for young adults.  When you first start reading this book it may sound tasteless and uneventfull, but as you read further , you will start to enjoy it more and more.  This book has a well developed  plot that you will grow to love 
 I thought this might only interest science enthusiasts or real film buffs, but the acting and chemistry between Greer Garson (Mrs. Miniver) and Walter Pidgeon (Forbidden Planet) really  make science romantic.  There are other stars in the supporting cast, and they all do a great job bringing this slice of science history to life, including Robert Walker (Strangers on a Train), Van Johnson (30 Seconds Over Tokyo), Henry Travers (It's A Wonderful Life), C.Aubrey Smith (Beyond Tomorrow, Five Came Back), and Margaret O'Brien (Meet Me In St. Louis).  My favorite movies of this type are Edison The Man with Spencer Tracy, and Young Tom Edison with Mickey Rooney; but the sheer quantity of raw talent makes Madame Curie just as good as those favorites 
 In 1973, I was an un-soldier stationed at a remote U.S. army outpost in South Korea. We lived in metal Butler huts (hooches), 12 people per hooch; and most of the guys in my hooch were draftees like me. We spent a LOT of time sharing aromatherapy materials and listening to all kinds of music, including Eddie Kendricks, Pharaoh Sanders, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Al Green, Donny Hathaway, the James Gang...and Spirit.   Many nights I would fall asleep with the Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus playing in the background, over and over again, on a small portable cassette player that had been left running because someone had been too stoned to turn it off. The player was set up to auto-repeat every time it reached the end of the tape, so this album was literally the soundtrack of my own dreams for months. I never got tired of it. It's magical music.   These songs have always been out there just sort of weightless, floating above all of the other tunes in my musical subconscious. I've never completely figured out the lyrics to "Nothing to Hide" or "Life Has Just Begun" -- the lyric translations submitted online are just laughable -- but it doesn't matter. My own personal soundtrack has changed over the years, so I hear different things now than I did when these 12 songs first got under my skin, 34 years ago. Sardonicus still gives me goose bumps today. 
 After the density of "Ghost In The Machine" and the brilliant pop glow of "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic," The Police did as abrupt a course change as anyone could have expected. Sting had become the band's major-domo (or an egotistical maniac, depending on your point of view) and demanded that Stewart and Andy strip their music down to the barest of bones, and then see if the parts gelled by happenstance. Thus came "Synchronicity."  This is the album that pretty much defined The Police for many, and it really is a crowning achievement. Sounding only like The Police yet totally unlike their prior four albums, it remains an uncategorized success. Sting's lyricism became more fatalistic and poetic, trying to say as much in three words as most men dare to in novels. Songs like "Walking In Your Footsteps" or "King Of Pain" explore emotional territory in a sensitive and literate way.  But nothing here came close to "Every Breath You Take." Probably Sting's pinnacle as a songwriter, this tale of obsessive love to a classic pop melody became a rightfully deserved popular smash and drove the album to number one. Even the videos for "Every Breath You Take" and "King of Pain" reflected the shift in tenor. Instead of the near seizure inducing freneticism of the typical music video circa 1983, "EBYT" utilized long, slow shots with carefully motioned camera sweeps. (Thanks to the still eye-popping work of Kevin Godley and Lol Crème.)  The band did not forget how to rock. "Synchronicity II," with its howling bursts of Summer's guitar, actually cracked the Top 20. Stewart's "Miss Gredanko" was an "Avengers" themed political commentary. In fact, the only bad thing about "Synchronicity" is Andy Summers' virtually unlistenable "Mother." Other than "Mother," The Police used sophisticated production and arrangements to craft 1983's best album.  It was also The Police's swan song. The individual members never reached these heights again. As an additional note, the original vinyl album ended with the melancholy "Tea In The Sahara," and "Murder By Numbers" was a b-side. It was attached to the original CD issue in an effort to lure in fans of 'bonus tracks,' but it has always been my contention that it was off the album for a reason. The re-mastering also shows up the song's shortcomings - it is nowhere near as smooth as the rest of the CD. Thank heavens for CD burners; you can recreate "Synchronicity" without "Murder By Numbers" and "Mother." It makes for a much better experience. (But this is still a classic. You like 80s music? You must have this. 
 While reading this novel you will be caught off guard by the relevancy of Sinclair Lewis's insights into the priorities and caste system of the typical American small town and it's surprising relevance to current American surburbia.  Fantastic novel that needs more attention 
 When I read Oliver Twist, I literally could not put it down. I was getting in almost 90 pages per day!! It was so enticing, exciting, funny, suspensful, scary, whitty and downright fun. This is a testiment to Dickens' mastership, for it was his second book that he wrote. And personally, I think it is his best. Fagin, Oliver, Bill Sikes, The Artful Doger, Nancy, Mr. Bumble, Mr. Brownlow, Mrs. Maylie, all are wonderful characters that fit perfectly in this timeless masterpiece. Each of them have distinct personalities that are wonderful.  However, I deeply implore yo to READ THE UNABRIDGED VERSION!!! You will not understand most of the plot unless you read an abridged version.  Other than that, enjoy this wonderful masterpiece.  Oh and, Bravo Mr. Dickens, Bravo!! 
      What is the use of publishing a rock biography about a band hardly anyone has heard in America.  One appearance on Jay Leno and two short tours resulting in stolen equipment.  Why?  The Suede story is more than a jumble sale of business meetings, hype, and record deals; it's epic, spanning, even "Machiavellian" according to lead chanteuse Brett Anderson.  All right then, power to the princes of Britpop.        David Barnett has a stunning go of following Brett and the gang from diapers to drugs.  Highlights include the courting of Justine Frischmann (later of Elastica fame) in a love story that will have any girlie agog and the polarization that forced Bernard Butler to leave the band.  Barnett's descriptions of all events, down to dress and décor, are as colourful as a girl on the cover of a magazine.  He sculpts each member fully as a character, except for pop-tartlet Neil Codling whose brief stint with Suede, other than a few common stories, is discussed to a minimum.        Unlike later bands only qualifying to fling themselves on a bandwagon of media frenzy, Suede was the grandfather of Britpop.  Don't let the nomenclature stop you.  This isn't a Blur or Oasis tale of rabblerousing fools.  Suede's intellectual, artistic sensibility, in this biography, as in their music, is given priority.        Moreover, Barnett has credibility.  A member of the Suede team for a number of years, he includes personal anecdotes not only enhancing the story but also giving it a flash, friendly style.  Knowing the band is, honestly, half the battle especially when it comes to Suede.  Reclusive, psychotic, artful, and unmatched, this biography takes you all the places you wanted to go: from Spain to Camber Sands and back again. 
 Very different from the movies, but very good in its own righ 
 I'm only able to listen to audiobooks because not many are produced in braille, and those that are are so ridiculously high in price range.  So when I saw the Talisman on audio on Amazon, I knew I had to read it.  Frank Muller narrating the book was also another reason why I snapped it up.        These two authors work extremely well together, and Muller delivers an absolutely stunning performance.  Yes, its a bit lengthy, but I for one enjoy reading epics such as this.  The main characters are easy to identify with, and due to Muller's methods of portraying each one through outstanding vocal performances, it was very difficult to see one of these characters die midway through the novel.  Yes, I had to stop the tape and just cry for a few minutes.  I mean, the guy's that good at making you become attached to the characters.  I'd give you a synopsis, or try to analyse this thing, but its been done before.  If Amazon still carries the unabridged recording of this book on either cassette or cd, and if you have the cash, why not experience this novel in audio format?  And if you've never listened to anything performed by Muller, here's one of his best.  
 When I saw "The 13th Warrior" is the theater, I was struck by the number of similarities it had to Beowulf. I didn't realize until a few years later that was the point of the movie. Nor did I realize then it was based on a novel by Michael Crichton.  The movie and the story work well together in a simple format. An Arab courtier, after a dalliance with a married woman, is "promoted" to ambassador and sent on a doomed mission. On the way, his band encounters a band of Viking warriors. He is conscripted to journey to their homeland to fight an ancient evil, monsters in the mists. Along the way he notices the great cultural differences between himself and the Northmen. His records of the sexual prowress and daily hygine definitely stay with the reader.  Despite the artful telling of the story and the true writings of Ibn Fadlan that are used as a foundation, it still can't compare to the rustic beauty of the original Beowulf poem. Nothing against a great writer like Crichton, but there are some things just best left as they are

 This volume contains the early work of Eliot before the conversion to Christianity and the writing of the 'Four Quartets'. It contains as signature poem Eliot's famous early work , "The Wasteland". The "Wasteland" is in a way a poetic parallel to Joyce's Ulysses, in its attempt to reread parody incorporate and transcend the entire literary tradition which preceded it. Its great opening " April is the cruelest month/ breeding lilacs out of the dead land/ Mixing memory with desire/ Stirring dull roots with rain. " is the parallel to Chaucer's greater opening" Whanne that Aprille with his shoures soote/ The droughte of March hath peerced to the rote. " Eliot in his work on "Tradition and the Individual Talent" stated how each new work that becomes part of the Tradition transforms the way we read all which precede. This is what the "Wasteland " attempts to do , and his world devoid apparently of spiritual myth and meaning incorporates fragments which only fiftully ' shore up the ruin' of Western Civilization. Again this work is the first stage of Eliot but the one attuned to the spirit of the time, and the devastation wrought by the First World War.  Eliot is without question a great poet of memorable lines. This volume contains some of the famous shorter pieces including "The Ballad of J.Alfred Prufrock" Unfortunately Eliot was tainted by displaying at times the social anti- Semitism so prevalent in the upper reaches of the British society he aspired to belong to.  Writing this review a question is raised which occurs unfortunately time and time again in encounters with creators , whose artistic works may be admirable, but whose moral principles fail the test.  In regards to Eliot this is not simply a question of Anti- Semitism, but also of a kind of snobbish, effete high- culture Anglo- worship which even made him slightly contemptuous of his native America and its culture. This small volume again contains the major poems of his early years and is in this way highly valuable. 
 As someone who loved this wonderful series during the 50's and in sindication in later years - I still love it today - at age 51. As many have said - it seems that George Reeves was the one and only person to portray Superman. He had the charm, charisma, the classic fine features, sense of humor, as well as very appealing vocal and acting qualities many actors today I'm sure - wish they had. And of course - that wonderful smile of his that few could resist. I have read that he was a very nice person to work with on the set and was always very sensitive and kind to others. However - I'm not sure if everyone out there who loved him in the role knew how much he loved children and how much he did for them. I've heard and read many interviews about him and his portrayal of Superman and how he would devote many hours entertaining sick children in hospitals as the man of steel. Many children indeed - looked up to him as their own Superman and the great and wholesome role model he portrayed. "Around The World With Superman" the last episode in the second season dvd, very nicely shows George's sensitivity and love for children as he tries to help a young blind girl regain her sight and takes her on a once in a lifetime flight around the world - in his arms. When he first visits the girl in her mother's apartment as Clark Kent and as Superman - with the aid of the wonderful background music that made the 50's series so memorable and enjoyable - one can clearly see George Reeve's love for children in his voice and the things he says to her and way he looks at the young girl.  Indeed - a very touching and sensitive episode, and in my humble opinion - a very nice and memorable tribute to George.     
 I've only had this cookbook about a month, but have tried several of the recipes and have received great reviews from 4 picky children and a husband who will eat anything!  Living in a small town I need recipes that take "normal" ingredients, and with 4 kids things need to go together pretty quickly with our busy schedules.  The recipes are easy to follow, and you truly can put them together in 30 minutes or less.  The authors of this cookbook also make the book an interesting read with great tips and ideas for a busy cook.  Everything from stocking the pantry and freezer to ideas for easy short cuts.  You'll love it 
 I rated this book a four instead of a five for one major reason.  The book's poses and postures arn't in a very clear order, and certainly not done by experience level.  The book is WONDERFUL in discussing what lead her to yoga, medititation, and the history of yoga.  Overall, I highly reccommend this book.  As a poor college student, its cheaper then a gym membership and keeps SOME of the stress from school down : 
 There appear to be several tangled threads in CANE that join the three parts of the book together. The first thread unifying the collection of poetry and prose is the way it was put together. In book one you have the narrator observing rural negroes in the south. In book two you have the narrator express-ing the discontent of urban negroes. Then, in book three, you have old Kabnis, a northern negro, trying to escape his pain by returning to his roots in rural Georgia. Coming full-circle. And yet not. Part Two should come first, with its discontented youth, then "Kabnis", then Part One. Why does Toomer choose to progress from spiritual unity to disunity? Is it because the book truly represents a cycle which has no beginning and no end? A clue to this is in two poems, "Reapers" and "Harvest Song". Both are written on related topics, and yet "Reapers" is the first poem of the book, and "Harvest Song" the last. In "Reapers" a rat is injured by a scythe, and yet "the blade, blooded-stained, continues cutting weeds and shade" oblivious to or uncaring of the rat's injuries and pain. In "Harvest Song" the narrator is a reaper who, at the end of the day, with his work still unfinshed, fears his own hunger so much that he distracts himself with pain, "...My pain is sweet...It will not bring me knowledge of my hunger." What, exactly, is it that Toomer's characters hunger for?  Another thread appears to me to be the striving for unity. This desire for unity is expressed in the ways in which the men and women in CANE strive toward unity in their relation-ships. Admittedly, they fail miserably. The women in the book are terribly one-sided--sex objects that are either passive, as with Karintha and Fern and Avey, or active, as with Carma and Louisa and Bona. However, for all their being available physically, the females Toomer portrays in his cameos are untouchable or out of reach spiritually. The men are also one-sided--rational and yet passionate, often overcome by lust and rage. These probably function to demonstrate Toomer's personal views on what men and women are, and how their desires for unity in healthy relation-ships produces a significant amount of pain as a result of their oppositeness.  Pain is yet another thread that unifies the poetry, sketches, stories and drama of CANE. After all is experienced, the pain is what is left, the only significant fruit of their struggles. In Part One, the pain everyone suffers seems to be symbolized by the ever-present cane. The cane, which can cut the skin, must be ground, the juice boiled and cooled, in order to obtain it sweetness. Is the pain which the characters savor the sweetness in their lives? And if so, wouldn't the cane also represent the sweetness (pain) in their lives? In Part Two, which takes place in the urban North, the Negroes live repressed, frustrated, and sadly warped lives. The pain is intellectualized, yet it is still there, doubly so. Is this a result of being separated from the soil--that which is perceived to be source of their spirituality--as well as their failure to form meaningful relationships? The pain in "Kabnis" is more incoherent, the pain of an urban negro who has returned to his roots only to find that he cannot accept them, is alienated by them.  It is impossible to discuss all of the tangled threads that weave CANE into the powerfully moving and unorthodox novel of Toomer's voyage of self-discovery. It is often incoherent, filled with evocative recurrent images, and powerful character sketches that leave the reader unfulfilled, confused, and hungry for more. Perhaps it is Toomer's own hunger, expressed in his writing, that the reader picks up. If there was more to the novel, perhaps one could pin down the more elusive points. Then again, perhaps not.  
 This is one of the best watercolor books I've seen. It is well written, has lots of detail, and Nita Engle is generous with her information, e.g.her color choice and palette arrangement, two of the most difficult items to manage in my painting.             I immediately attempted to take a seminar with her which, as to be expected, was full and has a waiting list. Next year I'll be first on the list. Seeing her tenichques is most interesting, even for those who may adapt them 
 Overall, I like this.  Evanescence gave an outstanding performance (although some songs sounded a little alike), and I was surprised at good they sounded live.  Also included are the band's music videos to date, which are worth checking out if you haven't seen them before.  The "insightful" behind-the-scenes segment offers a personal look at the band, revealing a free-spirited (although sometimes silly) side that one would not expect when considering the content of their music.  That said, this package is still far from perfect.  My cheif complaint was the videography itself.  There are lots of unnecessary special effects edited into the performances, and the cameras switch so often and so quickly that it actually makes the show uncomfortable to watch at times.  Also, the CD track listing is incorrect, and this could potentially cause some problems when trying to copy songs from the CD.  Because of those complaints, I would recommend this primarily for Evanescence fans, especially those who have never seen them play live.  For everyone else, I suggest checking out the "Fallen" album first 
 James comes through again. A real page turner. Andrew Gross picked a winner to collab with 
 I'm not going to write a very lengthy review because when people write paragraphs on a product I don't bother to read it. What I'll tell you is that I am a seventeen-year-old avid music listener and The Lost Trailers could perhaps be my favorite band. Their music is rock with a bit of country in it. For those of you who do not like country, neither do I and I love the Trailers. Please Please Buy, I swear you won't be disappointed 
 As a student of history and politics, I was stunned at the depth and heretofore unknown facts that established the court as it functions today. In fact, as revealed in Men in Black, the founders had no intention to establish a Supreme Court that functions as it does today, to wit, on whimsical mood and mode.Furthermore, the constitution did not define such Court function. That the average person who is somewhat aware of the makeup of America's political base has never been taught any of the information covered in Men in Black is a downright shame. This lack of education allows for the court to continue to be corrupted by 'common feels' of the moment, instead of performing its basic, and only function I might add, which is to rule on the law 
 This is one of the finest books of it's kind that I've yet to see. Wonderfully done and should be in every players home.  
 This is the second of the Ophelia and Abby mystery series.  These books are a delightful blend of mystery spiced up with a dash of the paranormal.  I like the fact that the paranormal stuff isn't so much "new age" but is more like something one would read in the Foxfire series on the disappearing Appalachian life.  In this story, Ophelia comes face to face with what was likely the most defining moment in her life, the death of her good friend Brian in Iowa City 5 years earlier.  Without spooling the plot, Abby is not as influential in this story, Darci is as amusing as ever, and Rick from Witch Way to Murder is out of the picture.  Instead, there is an annoying journalist from the city, the cop who investigated Brian's death, a pig farming conglomerate, and a coffee table book photographer from the East Coast.  Damsgaard goes light on what I've seen with the politics surrounding these large corporate pig farms. So, it doesn't get preachy on that very touchy subject.  
 After the blow-out success of their movie, creators Stone and Parker realized just how much they could get away with in their show (there are some funny stories about that in the mini-commentaries to be found on these discs).  They used this new-found power not just to reach new heights of depravity, but also to more effectively utilize the show as their own personal soapbox.  A tactic like this would cripple shows of less caliber; it is what gave South Park its new legs.  Proving themselves capable of taking on any subject (and rivaling even some news programs with their blink-of-an-eye topicality), season four finds the kids waxing philosophic on hate crimes (Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000), the Elian Gonzales controversy (Quintuplets 2000), holistic medicine (Cherokee Hair Tampons), the Confederate flag (Chef Goes Nanners), the presidential election (Trapper Keeper), and, of course, religion, in the two-parter "Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?" & "Probably," which could be viewed as a quasi-sequel to the movie.  Most notably, this season introduces us to Timmy, a character that Comedy Central initially (and understandably) balked at.  Thank God they let this vocabulary-challenged child on the air; who would've guessed that this unlikely staple to the show would prove to be much much more than a one-joke wonder.    The boys behind the screen also churned out some of their most famous episodes this year.  Kenny gets grosser than ever (and Cartman slims down, maybe) in "Fat Camp."  South Park goes rogue when the parents all leave town in "The Wacky Molestation Adventure."  We are treated to a disturbing (and absolutely hilarious) look into the gory depths of Cartman's brain in "Helen Keller! The Musical."  Mr. Hanky returns in "A Very Crappy Christmas."  And, in arguably one of the shows best episodes ever (if not the most memorable), Cartman -- seeking more "mature" friends -- joins NAMBLA.  The show skids a few times in this season.  Their recreation of Dickens' "Great Expectations" is amusing, but only gets laugh-worthy when the show strays from the script (Genesis machine! Robot monkeys!).  Even on the mini-commentary (these guys aren't just a treat to listen to, they also give the inside scoop on a lot of things you'd want to know anyway), the creators admit "Chef Goes Nanners" has their most "bummer" ending.  And although "4th Grade" is responsible for introducing us to Ms. Choksondik (and also for finally outing Mr. Garrison), it seems like one of the weakest episodes in this season.  But, then again, in a season starring Cheech and Chong, where we're treated to a reality-warping Kyle and Cartman as the tooth fairy, where a handicapped child gets a handicapped pet, and where the kids form a boy band with an unlikely name, the competition is notably fierce.  Another great season for a stand-out show 
 Nobody writes about sex and money like Kevin Doyle.  His othe titles HOW TO MARRY MONEY and DATING YOUNGER WOMEN make perfect presents for dinner parties, graduations, stocking stuffers, Valentine's, etc.  Doyle writes also under pen-names RUTH LESLEE GREENE and MARK MCBRIDE.

 I was just looking at my 8 year old Mavis and I relized it only has four wheels. The one in the picture has 6 wheels. Of course Salty in the picture has eight wheels and our Salty has six but that made me wonder. Because of Mavis's sideplates she doesn't run very well but my little sister loves her anyway. I wish they'd make the magnets like the take along Thomas magnets that u can connect both ways but I guess we can't have everything 
 I have enjoyed Excel 2003 Formulas, as I have been able to incorporate numerous examples into my spreadsheets at work, where I improved the quality of my work and streamlined my processes.  It was well worth the investment for the text as it as paid for itself in the first week.  The examples are straightforward and easy to understand.  The chapters are well-organized 
 Peter Clement has been writing medical thrillers for a number of years, utilizing his experience as a hospital emergency room physician to bring an edge-of-the-seat feeling to the events that he describes so succinctly and realistically. Clement does not pull any punches in his descriptions of his medical procedures, and his novels require our undivided attention. Always a good writer, he has polished his rough edges to the point where he is becoming an A-list thriller writer. His latest, THE INQUISITOR, featuring Dr. Earl Garnet, firmly ensconces his position there.  THE INQUISITOR opens with a terminally ill cancer patient being relentlessly questioned by a voice, whispering in the dark, asking her to describe what she sees during the final moments of her life. As the story unfolds Garnet begins to notice a pattern --- a cluster, if you will --- of deaths at St. Paul's Hospital, which leads him to suspect that someone on staff may be prematurely terminating the lives of patients. The hospital and its staff, already stressed by the SARS epidemic, is at a breaking point, and virtually everyone --- even trusted members of Garnet's own emergency room staff --- is a suspect. What Garnet does not suspect is that his investigation, initiated with the intention of protecting the innocent, is directly putting members of his staff at risk --- and his wife, pregnant with their second child, is ultimately in the greatest danger of all.  THE INQUISITOR is, quite frankly, impossible to put down. It is by far Clement's best work, a heart-racing thriller that leaves the reader guessing the identity, and motive, of a diabolical murderer until almost the very end.  For those readers heretofore unfamiliar with Clement, and Garnet, THE INQUISITOR will make true believers of them. Recommended.     --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlau 
 F'ed up Ford. Oh. My god. One of the best live bands ever. This band is pure talent. I reccommend buying the Rev's albums in chronological order. But this is worth the money for F'ed Up Ford by itself 
 I read this book a while ago when I was first getting serious about understanding the investing techniques of successful investors.  It is an interesting read and has some good ideas about how to approach investing generally.  In particular, it does a decent job of enumerating the differences between a commodity business and a consumer monopoly to identify the latter for investing purposes.  Most interesting to me was the overview of the 3 different ways Buffett purportedly analyzes stocks: by comparing to the yield in a T-Bill, the ROE model, and the "equity bond with a coupon model."  I find these models somewhat useful because they enable some level of analytical understanding of how to value stocks.  However, it does not impart just how much work goes into finding stocks to invest in, and it does not disclose some of the "special situations" that have helped Buffett enjoy as much success as he has.  Because the book is "hands on," it does not delve into various theories of stock value (for example, John Burr Williams theorized that stocks are worth the aggregate value of their dividends, discounted to present value), nor does it discuss cash flow analysis.  Although the book is generally useful, it also does not emphasize financial statement analysis, which is particularly important given that the models used tend to project ROE and earnings per share forward.  In all, however, this book is an easy read, and because it provides some analytical tools, I found it useful.  Moreover, I found the list and discussion of companies that might make suitable investments at the back to be interesting, if somewhat dated, because the descriptions articulated exactly what constitutes a "consumer monopoly" or otherwise desireable target 
 Also for Baywatch-fans this CD from Chris Rea is a worth recommendation to their collection. The CD contains the song "I just wanna be with you" that was used for the Baywatch-episode "Island of romance" (1992 / season 3). While hearing this "warm" song, you'll remember those female housekeepers cleaning and cooking for Mitch and Hobie.  If you are interested in songs that featured on Baywatch, you can buy here on Amazon.com the Book: "Baywatch - Rescued from Prime Time". This book contains all credits from songs/artists (like Chris Rea), that you can buy here on Amazon.com  The soundquality of this CD is excellent 
  This is one of the few books that humble me when I contemplate it. Rather, Madam Blavatsky's knowlege and intellect humbles me. Take just about any "newly rediscovered" esoteric topic of any worth and you will most probably find it explained in considerable detail in either this work or _The Secret Docrine_. I am dismayed that so few people, or biliographies, give credit to Madam Blavatsky, or to the Theosophical Society that she founded. I guess we are just too "quaint" and "old-fashion" for the "New Age."   There is just too much encyclopedic knowlege here to simply read through from scratch. You need to work up to it. Try a introductory text like _Ocean of Theosophy_ by William Q. Judge. However, do not be afraid to pick up either volume and simply "browse." I still do this after all these years- and I am still surprised and amazed at what I find.   One further thing, there has been a considerable amount of character assassination against Madam Blavatsky in the last few years. The authors that have penned these attacks have no understanding of the matters that they address. First of all, no one was a stronger critic of seances than Madam Blavatsky. Secondly, the Society has always held that one should never charge money for spiritual matters. As for the ad hominem attacks that she was grossly obese, well, this is the lowest form of slander and doesn't deserve comment. Simply take a look at any of the surviving photographs to see the truth.    Concerning attacks on Theosophical concepts such as  the "seven races" and "seven globes", just keep in mind that the perenial philosophy holds that the highest part of what makes up a person pre-exists on a higher plane- and will return there after we cross over. Just remember the old gnostic concept of "seven heavens." Literalism is a mistake in theosophy, just as it has proven in fundamentalist Christianity 
 And I've felt like Katz is on my trip every day.  I've read his other books and when I heard him on NPR talking about this book I thought "I've GOT to get that."  I did.  My clients depend on me to provide good info about caring for their pets, and I depend on me to not fall for the latest fad.  Katz gives you permission to define your own relationship with your dog.  But he INSPIRES you to be the BEST dog owner you can be.  My dogs are my life.  They inspire me to run a better pet-care company, but they also challenge me to introduce dogs to people in a way they (humans) can accept and fit into their world.  My dogs are funny, smart and wise.  They are also spoiled, food motivated and make decisions on their genes...dog genes.  Did I agree 100% with Katz?  No.  Do I agree with ANY dog expert or training methodology 100% -- No.  My relationship with my dogs and those of my clients is constantly evoloving....what more can you ask for?  Do you love your dog and wonder if you can be a good dog owner?  This book is for you.  Do you think you have all the answers on dog training because you've paid for the best trainers?  Again, read this book -- it gives you permission to be you.  This is a great book for any dog lover - but it won't make everyone happy -- that's ok.  Your dog will STILL love you.

 I've read at least half of Thomas' twenty some novels (including Vandenberg, written under the pseudonym Oliver Bleeck) and I don't know that I could rate any of them higher than Ah, Treachery!(a pretty strong statement considering how fondly and vividly I remember The Fools In Town Are On Our Side, even after twenty-five years).  Thomas has a dry and ironic tone in his fiction and a gift for understated outrageousness that is pretty nearly incomparable among today's writers.  It's no exaggeration to say that Thomas does better in a paragraph what takes a goodly number of authors a page.  He's been compared to Raymond Chandler, and I think he "out-Chandlers" Chandler.  As I read Ah, Treachery!, knowing it was his last, I had to marvel at the control and effortlessness of the work--no fading talent here 
 While I say this CD is surprisingly good, this may be an understatement. This CD is great with good R&B/Soul music selections, great arrangements, great sound and a great band. Many of the songs sound better than the originals and the recording quality is absolutely first rate. In fact, the recording is so good, I'm inclined to believe that regular CD is still improving and those high resolution CD playback formats are unnecessary. In my opinion, this is the best CD from Maysa and is a most purchase for those who enjoy the smooth jazz/soul/R&B groove. 
 Yes, it's true, the Queen of Norway is a sworn enemy of all giraffes, as are Gila monsters, millipedes, toucans, Lee Iacocca (and his nephews), and Matthew Perry. This educational book will teach you these facts and many more about giraffes. Did you know that giraffes are from Neptune and came to Earth on a conveyor belt? Did you know that if given the choice giraffes prefer to live in Terre Haute, Indiana? Did you know that giraffes control the world's supply of ice? You will discover these truths and much, much more in this book, written by noted giraffe scientists Dr. and Mr. Doris Haggis-On-Whey.   This book is suitable for all ages, and even includes several useful flash cards in the back to help you study important giraffe facts. One of the most useful topics covered is the useful list of giraffe expressions, such as "I'm about to go High Renaissance on your toes," and "My pants are off, put the kettle on." There is even a chapter on the little known mortal enemies of giraffes, sea monsters from the deep, and illustrations of such epic battles as "The Clipper Ship Edward Rhys-Davis Battles the Humongous Sand Woman From Upper Volta," and "The Clipper Ship Tina Yothers Battles the Indescribably Inimitable and Big Driftwood Creature of the Bay of Bengali." These battles are illustrated with the monsters represented by plastic toys, while the Clipper Ships were fashioned out of fig-oriented treats for utmost realism.  This is a wonderfully entertaining and hilarious book, which I highly recommend to anyone with a sense of humor. If you want to know more about giraffes, I guarantee that this book will reveal things which you had never imagined. 
 Richard Carwardine's biography LINCOLN: A LIFE OF PURPOSE AND POWER has already received the prestigious Lincoln Prize and is an exceptional presentation by an Oxford historian who considers the extent of Lincoln's political career and impact and his moral and social philosophy. Carwardine uses original research to probe Lincoln's personality and objectives, providing a different set of viewpoints about the war president and his use of power during office. LINCOLN surveys the office as much as the man and is an outstanding, detailed coverage which will prove a 'must' for any researching Lincoln's life or times. 
 Baker's "House and Senate" offers a thorough examination of the differences and similarities that exist between the House of Representatives and the Senate.  The differences and similarities include: size, prestige, term length, re-election, perception by the media, lobbyist attitudes, availability, and method of governance.  This book is a great source of information and is relatively easy to read.  This book is complimented by Davidson and Oleczak's "Congress and Its Members" 
 Usually when these old television shows (that really weren't all that great)are made in full length movies (most of which aren't that good)usually miss the mark.  Not this one, maybe its the superb cast Raul, Jessica and the rest, maybe the director really had some affection for the old tv series and stuck pretty much to the original feel of the show. I really enjoyed this, you might too

 Thankfully, there are a few authors who are committed to helping others improve their chances of living a life filled with love. Gary Chapman is one of the very best. With this book THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES, you will gain a tremendous amount of knowledge about what goes into the experience of loving and being loved, and several concepts you can use in your real life to improve your odds.  This book will definitely help you learn how to get more love - and better love. And after all, that is the true richness of life.  On this subject, I also recommend Clint Arthur's "Free Your Love Now" 
 This is a beautiful book ... beautiful in concept, execution, and expansiveness. It's more than a book: it's a piece of art, it's a philosophy, it's shares a way of being more fully alive. It can be read as a building manual, as an inspiration to greater nourishment of self and community, or as an introduction to a score of unique, creative, and hopeful individuals, all of whom are living their lives fully,  I've read it cover to cover and enjoyed every nuance of it. I shared it with a dozen friends, all of whom had different but meaningful experiences with it.  Read and enjoy the discussions that it will engender 
 I'd never heard of Sonia Choquette before, but work in a library and have seen and read literally hundreds of books on this topic over the past 10 years. I was about to dismiss this one, as I feel like I've read enough  books of this nature and should move on to other topics....'-) As I quickly skimmed through some of the chapters,however,  I was impressed by how grounded, sensible and  "high level" Ms. Choquette's work really is.  This is not just a book about trusting your vibes; it is a really well-rounded and well-GROUNDED manual for living a life of kindness (to yourself and others),  integrity - (being TRUE to yourself and others) and creativity (encouraging the development and expression of our talents and passions).  The author has a strong grasp of some really  key spiritual ideals (including Christian, Buddhist, Sufi)  and she describes the value of meditation and quiet in stilling the mind to connect with our higher selves. She does this in a way that speaks to the truth in all of us without much reference to religion or spirituality per se.  If I were to recommend just one book on developing intuition,  connecting with your higher self, or general self-development, I would actually feel comfortable in recommending this one because of its breadth, simplicity and the obvious integrity of its author.  If you truly followed just one of her tools for developing what she calls "six-sensory living" your life would improve immeasurably.  Many of her tools I've tried myself as presented by other writers and teachers and they all do work. 
 As I stated in my review of the "Blues Masters," this DVD and the Blues Masters are second only to the DVD "The Blues." Anyone who loves the blues should have this DVD in his/her collection 
 My mother picked this book out for me.  I was shocked, is this how she viewed me...too busy, stressed out, maxed out?!  Yes, this book is me to the tee and Debi has a humorous way of dealing with us Marthas.  The book showed me how out of balance my life was.  It made me stop and think about priorities.  I now have permission to relax, let go and live a much more balanced life.  If you are at the end of your rope and wondering how you can possibly balance it all...this book is for you!  Come sit at the feet of Jesus and learn how to be more like Mary and less like Martha.  Thanks Deb 
 I love her writing I try to read all of her books but I have alot of favorites so I might miss some of her new one 
 I had a recent perl+mysql project and flipped between the Cookbook and the author's other work, MySQL, mentioned in other reviews.  ( also referred to the O'Reilly Perl books _Programming Perl_ and _Perl for System Administration_.  I don't usually have time to master any topic or skillset; I need to get in, get it going, and move on.  This book is perfect for that.  "How do I get the date?"  There's a recipe for that.  "How do I get perl to connect to the database and insert stuff?" There's a recipe.  Also for PHP, python, etc.  It's really focused on problem solving, and the problems are really well chosen.  This book will save you hours of effort.  
 The man knows how to write.  His conversational style conveys the feeling that he is seated next to you, telling one insightful tale after another. As one might imagine, the presence of John Ford looms large over the text. Hopefully he will write another volume about his experiences working with other film directors 
 These guys are the best.  I not only recommend this book, but I recommend their stage performance(s) as well - should they be appearing in a town near you. I bought several of the "Sky Maul" magazine/books for friends and family this Christmas.  For each and every person, it was a huge success. This Crap is funny.  Purchase often and a lot.  
 Buber is the Jewish teacher who more than any other helped bring the attention of the West to Hasidism. The Baal Shem Tov (1700-1760)is the founding teacher of Hasidism. In this work Buber tells twenty stories of the Baal Shem and reveals to us a world of deep faith, of deep connection of the Jew with nature and all creation, of the special hitlahavut or enthusiasm which the Hasid brings in his relation to the Divine. Buber is a Hasid of Hasidism, and he tells the stories of its great founder with the same kind of enthusiasm the movement itself generated throughout the Jewish world 
 This is one of those books that don't get old; although it was first published in 1952, and since then much has been made in Mathematical Logic, Kleene's book has that rare position of a book that influenced the subject on its own (and all the teaching books that came after). And if you are willing to understand Mathematical Logic, and principally the reasons behind most of the definitions, I think that this is the best book to start. As a reference it is perhaps the most cited book in the area. But the reading is pleasant, elegant and well motivated. This book has another kind of appeal, in my opinion - research in Logic split after the 1950's in two distinct areas: one, more mathematical in character, is called Model Theory and is strongly abstract, working mainly with the semantics; another, more philosophical and applied, deals mainly with the sintax - this last is the line of research of non-classical logics (philosophically interesting) and of automated procedures, like Smullyan's semantic tableaux for proof-theory (very useful for computation theory). Today the interconnections on these areas, that were initially very close, are dangerously disappearing. Kleene's book, having been written before this separation, is much more comprehensive than the modern textbooks. About the contents: it begins with a (very well) introduction explaining the meaning of Metamathematics. Then it treats Propositional, Predicate Calculi and Formal Number Theory, written in the classical spirit that unfortunately lacks today. The third part deals with recursive functions, and the author was a first-hand researcher in the field, with many important contributions. Finally, the last part treats Model Theory as it was known then (this section can be considered pretty incomplete today) 
 This book is a five star book!!!! I love it so much!!! Partly becuase I like mystery/adventurous books and I would recommend this to all of the people who like mystery/adventure. It is a GREAT book about a GREAT family when everything goes wrong when Janie Jonhson decides she wants to drink milk and when she looks at the back for the kidnapped kid - she learns too much.. 
 Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man is probably the most spirited book I've ever read.  All at once laugh out loud hilarious, tear jerking and touching, Daisy Fay is one of the best narrarators of our time. Her life takes place in a simpler time, but not without troubles.  Through the years the book tracks, she progresses from a fairly ignorant 11 year old to a bold teenager without ever losing a drop of her wit or kindness. Daisy Fay's story doesn't go much further than the Gulf Coast, but she takes us to every emotion you can feel.  Whether you find yourself empathizing because you've been there before or laughing along with her at the ridiculous situations she gets herself into, you'll never forget Daisy and the wild cast of characters that are in and out of her life 
 "Nothin' But The Blues" is nothin' but one of the best electric blues albums ever made. If this disc don't get you up on your feet, you're already dead 
 Michael Porter is the founding father for strategies in a competitive context. This pioneering book represents some of his best thoughts on business and corporate strategy.  Chapter 1 is a summary of his first landmark book - "Competitive Strategy". So if you just want to buy one of his bestsellers, then buy "Competitive Advantage".  The book's most important contribution is the concept of the VALUE CHAIN. Today, you won't find an MBA who doesn't know this idea. This book gives you all the details on the value chain. And it even tells you exactly how the value chain is translated into his two generic strategies: Cost Leadership and Differentiation. Most strategy books devote a separate chapter to this idea. If you want to get a more than a superficial understanding of the value chain, you simply have to read Porter's book.   This book also gets to the core of how synergies are created and when diversification might work. Curiously, Porter chooses the term interrelationships for synergies (you know, a term for a nice idea that rarely occurred in practice...).  Being a business development manager, I have strategic thinking as part of my key areas. This book is still a reference guide for me. Obviously though, Porter's views cannot stand-alone.   If you're looking for critical views on Porter's ideas, then consider buying Hamel & Prahalad's "Competing for the Future" (1994) or Kim & Mauborgne's "Blue Ocean Strategy" (2005).  Beware: You have to read Porter's Harvard Business review article "What is Strategy" from 1996, if you want his own response to the critics.    Warning: You cannot work seriously with strategy without having understood Michael Porter's core concepts. And the superficial introduction by most - even advanced - strategy books won't make you competent enough to apply his ideas skilfully. Let me give you two examples:  COST STRUCTURE:  Most MBAs have learned about the value chain and cost structure analysis. But in real life I've seen very few who combine these two concepts proficiently. The real beauty in benchmarking cost structures is when you skilfully apply it to the value chain. This book tells you exactly how to do this. In practice, I've seen this approach applied very few times (except advanced strategy consultants). It may be because people often use Porter's concepts too casually...  COST DRIVERS: Most strategy books are on drivers of differentiation - the preferred strategy choice by management gurus. And Porter does indeed help you on this issue. More importantly, this book is one of the few to tell you about the cost drivers. How many books have you read on Cost Leadership? Porter elaborates on 10 cost drivers, such as economies of scale, learning, linkages, synergies, pattern of capacity utilization, integration, timing, policies, and location.  STRATEGY IS ABOUT BEING DIFFERENT. Start out personally by reading the real thing ... it's a bargain.

 As a classical guitarist I have undoubtedly listened to hundreds of guitarists attempt the same repertoire as Franco Platino. However, I have never witnessed anyone-- ANYONE-- approach the level of musicianship that Mr. Platino has reached. Scintillating scales, supple phrasing, and an ever-present singing quality result in the most profound guitar recording extant. .. 
 I didn't find anything wrong with this album like most folks did. It was a little on the pop side, but look beyond that lyrically she was still at the top of her game. To some people her 2nd album may not have been her best, but if you love her buy this. She all makes up for it on her recent album "The Naked Truth" so don't sleep this 
 I admit, it took me about 2 weeks to read this book, but it was good. Jane is a very defined character, and although some of what happens is unlikely to the point of being almost unrealistic, it seemed to make sense. The only complaint I have is that I felt, many times, like I needed a French dictionary at my side. When Jane talks to Adele, and occasionally other people, it is usually in French, with no translation whatsoever. But since it was written in a time when most educated people took French, what can you expect? I would suggest publishers put footnotes with translations. The French is not, perhaps, very important to the story line (not that I would know), but it really bothered me to have no idea what they were saying 
 Claire Messud's second novel is so far her masterwork: an impressively constructed and written account of a wealthy French Algerian family falling to pieces, and their history of how they got to the point they're at. The breaking of the narrative down into numbered sections is beautifully done, and you find yourself deeply caring for what happens to the narrator, Sagesse (who unfortunately becomes a bit of a pill by the end) and her family members. Her troubled grandfather, snobbish grandmother, exuberant father and (especially) her emotionally wounded mother emerge off the pages as full and breathing characters, and the changes they go through seem extremely natural and believable. The novel is an account of what it means to be an alien in one's own country, and how this particularly becomes inflected by France's traumatic colonial involvement with Algeria. While Messud's prose at times becomes a bit precious, the novel is for the most part masterfully written and quite moving. This is a writer from whom to expect great things in the future 
 This is the best game I've played, detail is excellent, not hard to learn, more than one way to accomplish goals, really liked the way the pause feature worked to be able to issue different instructions to different troops at same time having them work together. REALLY enjoyed the SAVE feature (save as many times as you need and they will be there until you delete them, even if you finish game you can go back back and start at one of your saved points for repeat fun or change the way way you did it) so you can save at some point and then try different ways to accomplish your goal. AS I'm not a multi-player I can only comment on the Single player part, but well worth the time and price to have fun and can play over and over again on different levels.  If and when there is a follow-up I'll be right in line to get it 
 This book, released in 1999 by authors Loren Coleman and Jerome Clark, is one of the best ones out there, especially for the serious study of Cryptozoology. Just about every cryptozoological creature you can think of is in here-Bigfoot, Loch Ness Monster, Chupacabras, Champ-but there are also several lesser-known cryptids, such as Napes (North American Apes), Queensland Tiger, Thylacine (of which there have been recent sightings), Ucu and Waitoreke. The book is an encyclopediaq of hidden or unknown animals, but that's not all-several crypto-personalities are also profiled, including Tom Slick, John Green, Rene Dahinden, Dr. Grover Krantz, Bernard Heuvelmans, Ivan T. Sanderson, Mark A. Hall and other personalities in the crypto-field. This is a highly-recommended book, full of great info and done in a comfortable writing style which makes the reader feel like two old friends are discussing cryptozoology. Get this book 
 Like a lot of people, I never heard of Del tha Funkee Homosapien until Gorillaz came around in 2001. Who was that guy with the insane rap in Clint Eastwood and Rock The House? Eventually, I checked out his album: Deltron 3030. It featured Dan the Automator, another one of the top workers on the Gorillaz project. Deltron 3030 was, and still is, one of the best albums I've heard. Anyone who thinks rap is all about the bling best give that album a chance before turning it down. Deltron 3030 had great music, sick beats, and of course, the masterful lyrics that only Del could provide. So I checked out this album: The Elektra Years recently, and it's every bit as good as Deltron was, and another perfect introduction to Del's solo stuff if you haven't heard it yet.  I'm no rap expert. Not by a long shot. I don't listen to many rappers, as the majority of what's out there today is pretty sad. Del, however, is an exception. His lyrics are smart, he doesn't swear every other word, and you won't hear any slow sappy raps about loved ones from him *loooks over at P. Diddy*. He's a pretty upbeat guy that doesn't stop to catch his breath. In fact, you can't hear him breathe in-between verses, like you can with so many other artists out there. And on The Elektra Years, you'll witness some insane rhymes. There are some things I didn't think were possible to rap about, yet Del's able to. At the same time, some catchy beats are playing- most of which sound like they're from the early 90s, when rap was making its presence known. Again, I'm no hip hop expert, or a Del historian, but you can definately tell that a lot of these were from earlier in his career. Horns are used a lot in the tracks, and they work. Whereas there's a horn overkill in early 90s raps (Rico Suave in particular), they aren't over used here. And you gotta love how he throws in some rock elements. A few tracks have a pure rock driven guitar added into the mix, making everything even more diverse. You know what? I'm going to stop this review. If you liked Del's work on Gorillaz, then there's nothing keeping you from enjoying his solo projects. I'm not going to try and spoonfeed everything to you about how awesome this man is.  Some of my favorite tracks on this album (though all of them are good) are:  -Mistadobalina -Dr. Bombay -Wrongplace -Ahonetwo, Ahonetwo -Sleepin' on my Couch -Eye Examination -Missing Link -The Undisputed Champs  After this perfect best of collection, I'm wondering just how good his other, full albums hold up. Del tha Funkee Homosapien breaks the rap stereotypes, and here's to hoping that he continues puting out the good stuff. Bow before tha funkee one 
 This 500+ page book is a must for anyone teaching American history. You'll find copies of many primary sources such as the Mayflower Compact, Bill of Rights, and Articles of Confederation; profiles of major people in history and government; timelines of events; and facts related to economics, politics, health, crime, and public education. Also included are listings of American authors, musicians, historians, craftspeople, and much, much more.   Keep it on your desk and you'll have a handy reference guide that can be used for lesson planning or to make quizzes, handouts, unit studies, and vocabulary lists. For example, if you are doing a study on World War II, there is a list of major battles, major weapons used, military casualties, military leaders, which countries participated in the war, major events, and America's relative economic position. There is also a copy of the Atlantic Charter of 1941, FDR's Address to the Nation, and a chronology of the development of the atomic bomb. More than enough to help you teach this topic and provide handouts to your students 
 This is the best book available on the interrelationship between ethics and literature. Seeing the moral dimension of the works of Hawhorne, Hugo, Huxley, LeGuin and scores of others highlights the importance of morality in our lives and awakens the imagination to possibilities hitherto ignored. This is a wonderful book which every intlligent person should read 
 Being a member of a "discipleship movement", I have deep convictions about world evangelism.  Without a doubt, Jesus Christ has been the most influential/impacting man to ever live.  How did one man change the whole world? Answer: Discipleship.  You will be glad to know that this book is very short and easy to read.  It examines and reveals the secrets of Jesus' ministry.  Reading this book has changed my personal life, my ministry, and my church.  I strongly recommend this book for every disciple of Jesus 
 I feel like screaming at myself for being so fat-headed and missing out on some of the best music. I am a Purple fanatic and think that the players are some of the best. Now why didn't I but into this cd earlier? Because of Blackmore's departure. I was stuck on him being Deep Purple ! I was so wrong ! They live on even now.   Purpendicular is more melodic and fluid,very disciplined rock. The acoustics that Morse brings are beautiful. Gillan sounds good,and all songs sound fresh. Roots are maintained and newness is obvious. Don't sulk on Blackmore , it's not worth it , seriously! Morse is different and adds a new sound but a good sound. " Sometimes I feel Like Screaming" Loose My Strings" are great songs. There are a few songs that I could do without but hey , that's life 
 unless u count the Phil Collins songs.... Well they are forgettable indeed and an intrusion at times. This movie didn`t need songs....  The entire production is inventive and a repeated pleasure...  When u see Peter Jackson`s KING KONG 2005, u`ll find a lot of scenes "stolen" og "inspired" by this cartoon; notably the running from the elephants(dinosaurs in Kong), Jane`s chase from the mad apes(Ann`s escape from three Tyrannosauruses) and Jane`s amusing relationship with the ape man(Ann doing vaudville tricks for Kong - urghhh)  THIS IS A CLASSIC:- 
 Ok omarion is the finest man in my world i love him so much. But his album wasn't all that it was ok but not all that. but my favorite of all songs is TOUCH of course 
 Richard Gordon is a physician, a writer and a humorist. His history of medicine is, indeed, alarming. It was not so much what wasn't known that mattered, but what physicians thought they knew and did not. The book is light and quick paced. At times I wished Gordon had quit trying to be funny and had spent a little more time expounding on his massive knowledge of medicine and its history. I am not an expert in this field, but I did make an effort to check some of his facts...and he was right on target. The book is packed with medical trivia and funny gossip (sometimes horrible gossip) about its practitioners. Much of the information is astonishing if not alarming. The book lacks an index, which is infuriating and should be forbidden in these days of computers. It does have a few pages of references. In all I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and I certainly learned a great deal of new and interesting facts, despite the author's obsession with the quick, witty phrase 
 i only bought this because 'the light that blinds' is on guitar hero, but i was very impressed with the whole cd 
 This is one of my favorite movies in years.  The "trailers" and "making of" extras on the second disk make this item worth the price 
 I had previously tried Waterpik's other rain fall like showerhead the WaterPik CF-201.  It was horrible, the arm wouldn't hold its place and the one I recieved had this horrible leaking problem that was probably due to its largely plastic construction.  With low expectations of the Waterpik brand, I stumbled upon this gem.  The JP-130 looked a lot sturdier than their other model.  Upon recieving it, my initial impressions were true, fantastic!  The chromed metal gave it a distinguishably elegant look that no plastic showerhead can give.  The swing arm actually, when adjusted properly actually stays where you want it!  The spray pattern is a very soothing gentle stream.  It doesn't pack a lot of pressurized punch like some other heads do.  But I wasn't looking for that.  My only gripes if I had to point out any would be the need for possible a longer swing arm.  The 9" arm is more than suitable for most people.  But I'm 6'1" and it'd be nice to have a little more range.  I definitely couldn't imagine having to deal with a shorter swing arm.  Next, it's not really a problem, but I hope Waterpik eventually makes a newer model with an even wider head.  The 60 nozzles do a pretty good job of covering my entire body if I stand still, but moving around a little puts parts of my body out of the stream.  An extra 1" or 2" would be nice, an extra 3-4" in diameter would be the superb!  Regardless of the other reviews, I didn't find adjusting the knobs as hard as other reviewers made it out to be, maybe it's just me?  After reading what others said, I expected to give each knob my "death grip," but they didn't need it.  Overall, you simply can't beat this showerhead for money.  I'm sure it's even better than more expensive showerheads.  For something that people use multiple times a day, 7 days a week, it's money well spent!! 
 This book starts with a extremely well explained chapter on the philosophy of control charts. This is really the most important part of the book. Other topics about rational subgrouping and myths are also very well covered. The book deals with interesting examples which should be a little bit more up-to-date. Presenting control charts on mm-paper is outdated in this computer era 
 This book is loaded from cover to cover with practical mind-training exercises - from developing the power of one's imagination, to training different senses and perfecting the ability to use them individually or in conjunction with each other; to working with the elements; transfering one's consciousness; generating and projecting energy; and much more.  By the time you're done going thoroughly through all the exercises in this book and practicing them until you master them - your ability to use the power of your mind will increase beyond your wildest dreams - and you will have many interesting experiences along the way.  
 This is an excellent book to get a broad view of Modernism, what it means, when did it begin, etc. The format of the "Introducing" books makes for fun and informative reading. This is not a book for dumbies it is just put together in a way that makes it easy to learn. I suggest getting it with Introducing PostModernism 
 I would recommend anyone getting into the Terminator series should see this movie first.  Colossus - The Forbin Project demonstrates how computers and machines take over the world and for humanities first struggle to become free.  Very good plot and detail 
 This book is a series of essays on various topics related to World War I.  It does not claim to be a thorough analysis of the war, but it does point in directions for further thought and research.  I found the book to be quite fascinating.  For example, there is a chapter about forced labor behind the front lines that was new material to me.  Also, there is quite a bit about how the war was remembered and memorialized that is very intriguing.  A major thesis of the book is that Paul Fussell's idea about a big cultural disconnect resulting from the Great War is wrong.  The authors endeavor to show that, other than some avant-garde artists, most people continued to understand the world in traditional terms. Overall, a very stimulating book 
 Clive Cussler always comes through with an exciting, fast-paced, thriller.  His stories have some basis in fact and they always leave you thinking that this could really be true 
 I love this story. Echo lodge was great. It was about the last book where Anne is in Avonlea and a little girl. Very excellent book 
 The author of the novel is an intellectual who was forced to live in a labor camp from 1971- 1974...the end of the Cultural Revolution.  He is also a filmmaker and therefore he filmed his own novel. This combination is rare... so we witness an outstanding visualization of his book. It is a very interesting film with some breathtaking photography and engaging music.  It depicts the influence of listening to great literature upon the mind of an impressionable, intelligent girl peasant/seamstress who ultimately needs to explore her options beyond the narrow confines of country life.  (Personally, I thought that  the theme of literature's enlivening influence is even better treated in the wonderful book - "Reading Lolita in Tehran").  I could not quite give the movie five stars because there are more moving Chinese films of the cultural revolution, e.g. Gong Li in the masterpiece "To Live."  Nevertheless, foreign film addicts will not be disappointed when they buy this DVD 
 Yes, I finally read the book. I am still feeling the old man's pain.  There is not a place in the book to take a break.  Maybe when he takes his short nap.  But no matter, it is short and hard to put down 
     Gore Vidal is a great storyteller and his development of characters , as well as his re-creation of historical periods in our history is superb. Once I started this book, I could not put it down.      The story-teller in the novel is Charles Schuyler,a young assistant to Aaron Burr in his law office in New York in the 1830,s.Schuyler intends to write a biography of Burr,whom he much admires. Burr likewise has a great admiration for the young writer and begins to dictate to him his version of "what really happened "during the revolution and the creation of our republic.      Along the way we get to meet many famous characters from the revolution as seen through the eyes of Aaron Burr. Along with much political intrigue,we get some great portraits of George Washington,Thomas Jefferson,James Madison,John Adams,Alexander Hamilton,Martin Van Buren, Andrew Jackson, and even Davy Crockett.     In his afterword Vidal notes that his characters were seen through the eyes of Burr and don't necessarily indicate his own opinion.What I thought was great was that these men were portrayed as flawed human beings caught up in the particular period of time in which they lived,not always living up to their own rhetoric.Do any of us? The great men who founded our country are caught up in making political deals with one another,against one another,slandering each other,and generally displaying the same human failings that we all do at times.  Jefferson and Washington come in for especially harsh treatment from Burr,but when one considers the historical context and how Burr,s life intersected theirs, it is understandable how he may have seen them in this light.Burr himself comes across as always seeing himself as the one who has done the honorable thing,while others at times see it quite differently.I love the way vidal captures what it is like to be human.  I encourage anyone interested in American history to read this great book.             
 "When you learn to speak and see in archetypes, you start to comprehend the world and everything in it in an altogether different way." ~Caroline Myss  Over the years, Caroline Myss has created a series of CDs and books to provide a deeper understanding of our unique purpose here on earth. Through an understanding of Archetypes, you can begin to identify your archetypes and their shadow side. In this way you can focus on avoiding the shadow side (or neutralize the negative impact) and enhancing the positives. There are 11 CDs:   Your Symbolic Coordinates  and the Distribution of Cosmic Power  The Survival Family The Feminine Family The Masculine Family The Divine Family The Wisdom Family The Healer Family The Creative Family The Action Family The Wild Card Family  Speaking Archetypes at the Collective Level  and from An Impersonal Perspective  Since first learning about archetypes in 2004, I've noticed a definite evolution or maturing of some of my archetypes and a few new ones appearing as I learn to identify them. I'm also starting to realize that people around me are amazingly complex in regards to the archetypes they exhibit. If someone complains a lot or seems to live in a dark cloud, they may be struggling with the "vampire" archetype. Notice how it feels when someone continually complains about life. Do you feel a depletion of energy? Isn't that intriguing?   You may have thought you had the princess archetype, but if you are trapped in a tower you might be the damsel. The differences become clearer with detailed information. The knight and the warrior are fascinating because the desired outcomes of action are different. Through listening to these CDs you will now have the answers to these questions:   What is the true task of my soul?  What is the practice of congruence?  How can I tame my shadow side?  Do archetypes mature?  What are your 12 primary archetypes?   Through drawing on her own inner wisdom and insight, Caroline Myss makes this topic absolutely fascinating. She also gives examples from popular culture to make this all very relevant in our own time. Over time, the understanding of archetypes makes life simpler and it can also help you be more patient with other people when you see their shadow side appearing. You may also start to become more patient with yourself, because you start to realize you are on your own journey through the fires of spiritual transformation.   If you want to make this even more fun, the Archetype Cards (80-card deck) and Journal of Inner Dialogue provide a visual reference.   "The Language of Archetypes" is a fascinating journey through the powerful invisible forces that can take control of your life unless you learn to channel the energy and refocus your mission. Through understanding yourself, you truly can enjoy a more peaceful existence and walk the earth with a sense of fulfillment.    ~The Rebecca Review 
 I blasted her when she wrote The Apprentice and hated the Jane Rizzoli character. In Body Double however, I found the twosome of Maura and Jane a good match. This was a quick read, lots of twists and turns and a surprise ending that I thought was rather quirky and fun. This is a good read, not a great one. Tess does terror and suspense with a flair. I am happy that I gave this author another go 
 For Bill Haley fans this is a must read, and even the casual music history buff will enjoy it. The book contains interesting and relevant details, but not so much to wander away from the main topic or resort to "filler." If you don't know the story and characters behind "Rock Around the Clock," this is the perfect book to hear the rest of the story. Lots of pictures, too! Highly recommend 
 This book has been invaluable in dealing with my family's immigration needs. It gave great assistance in bringing both my parents and my grandparents into the country legally, without having to spend too much time with legal aid lawyers. My community has many people requiring this help and I have passed this book along to them. Thanks for this guide 
 Mcfarlane and company never cease to amaze me with their movie-based action figures.These figures are the exact replicas of those in the classic Bram Stoker's Dracula,each one has its own prop and is in a very scary pose,a MUST for any serious horror/action-figure/movie collector 
 Filled with imagery and symbolism from the Bible, this magisterial novel also draws on the epic tradition, tracing the roots of four generations of an African-American family as they fight a series of battles--against the legacy of slavery and racism, the loss of cultural values and roots, the trauma of injustice, and the self-centeredness resulting from economic success.  For all its elegance of development and seriousness of purpose, however, this 1977 novel by Toni Morrison is decidedly earthy, filled with unusual characters and exciting, often sensuous, stories about a family descended from Solomon, a freed slave who, according to legend, flew on his own wings back to Africa, leaving his wife and twenty-one children behind.   The male protagonist, Milkman Dead, is the arrogant son of a wealthy slumlord.  His aunt Pilate, a poor woman whose life is filled with love, is so vibrant a contrast and so dominating a force in the family, however, that she becomes the fulcrum upon which the action turns.  Milkman's selfishness vs. Pilate's compassion, his desire to escape from the family vs. her need to remember its stories and its past, his love-'em-and-leave-'em attitude toward women vs. her generosity of spirit ("If I'd-a knowed more people, I'd-a loved more," she says)--parallel the tensions which seize every generation of this family.  The novel develops impressionistically, not chronologically, as stories about characters from four generations unfold, seemingly at random.  The relationships of all these characters, along with the time line in which they live, evolve only gradually.  When  Milkman's father, Macon Dead, Jr., tells him the story about how he, accompanied by his sister Pilate, killed a man in a cave and then discovered many bags of the man's gold, Milkman begins the journey which will lead to his discovery of who he is and what gives real meaning to life.  In an effort to find the missing gold, he travels to the farm where earlier generations of the family lived, discovering, in the process, the missing links in the family's chain of memories.  Racism is a pervading theme, from the flight of Solomon to the execution of Macon Dead on his own land, and, in the 1960s, the formation of The Seven Days, a vigilante group that kills whites in direct proportion to the number of blacks killed and left unavenged.  The novel is primarily about an arrogant young man's self-discovery, however, and the importance of being connected.  Lyrical, richly descriptive, powerfully dramatic, and filled with symbols and motifs that connect Milkman in universal ways to the Bible and to the earliest epics, this is Toni Morrison at her best. n  Mary Whipple 
 Great book. Delicious, gourmet recipies. High calories- everything is butter, chocolate, buttermilk etc. but worth the treat once in a while! Who would think cupcakes could be so spe ical?  The cupcakes are one of the famous recipies from the Magnolia Bakery in New York- A++.  I have made quite a few recipies, just got the book a few weeks ago. Banana cake with white choc. and cream cheese icing- excellent.  Everything is superb! I am enjoying the book. 
 I am not wild about the colors and design, but it's not too bad.  The fabric is easy to clean (machine-washable) and the sun canopy is GREAT! With an adapter, I can easily snap it into my Bugaboo stroller for ultimate convenience.  It's just a great car seat, although I wish there were cuter girly designs.  
 Market revolution fills the need for a signifiant economic history on the development of American capitalism 
 This singles compilation shows the early evolution of this very inluential rock band. Songs like Just Can't Enough, Leave in Silence, Master and Servant and many others show how the band chnages style many times. In the early days it was a straight forward synth pop band with bouncy and meaningless lyrics such as New Life. Later on the lyrics improve allot due to the departure of Vince Clarke and Martin Gore taking over the task to write the music and the lyrics. He manages to pen such unforgetable tracks for instence everything counts, master and servant and many others. It is nice to see how a band starts and then matures and finds their true potential. This is definetely the case with this album 
 Each page of this gem is jammed with both trivia and wisdom, and I devoured it like a guilty pleasure. But the book is more than that. Like any good satire, this book operates and succeeds on many levels.  I came to Rubin's writing through her current work on The Happiness Project, of which I am a committed reader. Rubin's blog (........) -- where she reports on her experiments to bring more happiness into her life -- is brimming with earnestness. So when I started Power, Money, I was expecting more of that sweet, earnest voice. Instead, I saw her brilliantness and wit.  Rubin obviously has the ability to pitch her voice perfectly to each project.  Now, I'm off to tackle her "Forty Ways," books. If anyone could get me excited to read about political machinations, it's Rubin 
 This 2-fer CD, DANCING MACHINE and MOVING VIOLATION, is a continuation of the musical style that the "new" and now-older Jackson 5 had given us on GET IT TOGETHER, an excellent album where every cut clicks.   Although DANCING MACHINE (1974), entitled as such to capitalize on the success of the single (which was originally on GIT), has several different producers, they all attempted to keep the same theme in mind: to come up with funky and exciting sounds for the J-5, and that they do. Opening with the fantastic nearly eight-minute funk/rock dance groove of "I Am Love", you know that you are in for something special. Jermaine primarily handles the leads on this song, with Michael coming at the bridge. "Whatever You Got, I Want" is bluesy and has a slinky-type of feel with great lyrics. "She's a Rhythm Child" is basically a knockoff of "Dancing Machine", but it's not all that bad. The single edit of "Dancing Machine" is next, and nothing more need be added about the extraordinary appeal of this song.  Next is the J-5 dance classic, the quick-paced "Life of the Party", an all too-short song I would love to hear remixed to be a bit longer. "What You Don't Know" is another funky dance jam, then we have two great ballads back to back: "If I Don't Love You This Way" (Michael on lead) and "It All Begins And Ends With Love" (Jermaine on lead). DM closes out with "Mirrors of My Mind", keeping the funk/dance theme intact.  Most of the tracks on MOVING VIOLATION were produced by Brian Holland of Holland-Dozier-Holland fame. Holland had produced a great solo album for Michael entitled FOREVER MICHAEL earlier that year (1975), and it was a good move to extend that collaboration to producing some solid tracks for the J-5. Even though by this time, the brothers were not happy with Motown's treatment of them, MV is one of the best albums that they ever recorded. Not as funky as GIT or DM, but it is technically their last on Motown and Jermaine's last appearance with his brothers, so they did go out with a bang. An old Supremes track that was not a hit for those ladies but did fairly well for the J-5, "Forever Came Today" was the big hit from this album. Reworked into a driving 6 minute disco anthem, "Forever" will have you looking for your dancing shoes. "Moving Violation" is another funky disco cut, with clever lyrics...reminds you of "The Love You Save" theme-wise. The sexy dance tracks "(You Were Made) Especially for Me", "Honey Love" and "Body Language" (another well-known track from this album) increasingly moved the brothers into more mature waters. Most notably, "Especially For Me" has a hint of the Philly Sound that the Jacksons would take on their first two albums for Epic/CBS. The gorgeously harmonious "All I Do Is Think of You" is the only ballad on MV. It is a Quiet Storm radio classic, and still extremely popular today. The final three tracks, "Breezy", "Call of the Wild" and "Time Explosion" has futuristic touches of lite jazz and rock, material the brothers began to get into way back on GIT and on "I Am Love" from DM.   Two bonus tracks are included as well: a sweet ballad with Jermaine on lead vocals, "Through Thick and Thin", sounds like a throwback to the SKYWRITER album - and another mix of "Forever Came Today", although I can't really hear much difference between this one and the original, except that the second half of the song is completely instrumental.  These two albums together are a perfect combination! As much as I enjoy the J-5's earlier classic work, I feel DM/MV are far more interesting and artistically challenging. If you love dance music and the Jackson 5, then this is the CD for you!! Party over here! 
 Thomas Kinkade has given us a new series to look forward to that is comparable to Jan Karon's Mitford books.  If you liked them, you are bound to fall in love with the characters in this New England town 
 If the author believes one's "last check written should be to the undertaker, and it should bounce!" this is the way to do it. I think it's irresponsible to instruct people to spend what they make, but not overstep into debt. Yes, enjoy your hard earned money, give it away if you like when you are alive, but don't think for a minute you won't run out of resources before your last breath if you follow this book. Things I like about this book: I do like the notion of NOT retiring.  I think people are "retiring" at an alarming rate in the prime of their productive lives, and for what? Also the idea of spending cash instead of using credit is excellent advice for the instant-gratification age we are in. 
 Have you ever had to decide whether to pick up that juicy Tom Clancy book or that stale, but important business one? Steven Fink splits the difference and solves your problem with this book that is half spy story, half business advice. Sticky Fingers works best as a thriller. As business advice, the book highlights the basic issues for U.S. companies fighting economic espionage, but falls short of serving up a complete playbook. The devil, as always, is in the details, and the specifics of the books real-life cases sketch a more accurate picture of this particular devil than the generalized advice. If economic espionage is the elephant in the corner that your company has been pretending does not exist, we from getAbstract recommend Sticky Fingers as a starting point to finally taking action to protect yourself 
 Having recently read High Tide in Tucson, Barbara Kingsolver's first book of essays, I was looking forward to Small Wonder. I plowed into it, intending to read it in one- or two-hour chunks, in a few days. Big mistake.  The essays in Small Wonder are depressing and serious for the most part. It starts with thoughts on September 11, 2001, and revives the theme often. While we were all obsessed with those events for some time, it was a bit jarring to return to that obsession over three years later. Not that it isn't relevant or that we aren't obsessing about our current crisis, the Iraq War and its consequences. And not that these things aren't obsession-worthy. It was just that after the mainly upbeat and diverse essays of High Tide in Tucson, I found these dark and troubling essays tough going.  Don't get me wrong. I like Kingsolver's writing and I agree with nearly everything she says. I was just overwhelmed by the sadness and gravity of the subjects. I should have read the essays in shorter spurts. Instead I overdosed myself into a funk. Fortunately, a brisk walk to the nearby creek to check up on this spring's first batch of ducklings put things back into perspective.  I highly recommend High Tide in Tucson, and I recommend Small Wonder with a warning -- read in in small doses.   
 Sade's Love Deluxe Cd is one to relax to and just be.  Every single song is one to enjoy.  The opening song "No Ordinary Love" is my favorite.  
 While this is an interesting read I don't think I can swallow the anthropomorphic concept that Gaia has goals and intent.  Perhaps Earth is a self regulating system that tends to perpetuate a certain state but so does a hurricane and we don't say the goal of the hurricane is to keep the wind churning or that its intent is to stir up the ocean.  There is no need or evidence that the planet has intent and goals - just a self perpetuating climactic state.  It would seem more accurate to say that Earth's climate has a set point that lies in the range of habitability rather than saying Gaia's goal is to maintain habitability for life.  One wonders what neurons Gaia is using to have these goals and intent.    I also have a hard time with the notion that we need to change from Humanism (putting the welfare of the human race first) to putting Gaia first.  That is a historically long and involved philosophical debate which I hardly have the training to regurgitate accurately but it does seem to me that every mass extermination of some subgroup of humans by other humans is preceded by the idea that some X, Y, or Z deity needs to be served for his/her/its own sake rather than for the long term well being of humankind.  Best thing we can do for the planet is not to put Gaia first but to recognize that fouling your own nest is not a good thing *for people* in the long term.  Enlightened self interest.  Even Mr. Lovelock seems to believe this or why would he suggest that we need to quickly change to nuclear power to prevent Gaia from switching to a new, higher temperature, set point?  If we put Gaia first we should be very accepting as she exterminates us all and goes on about her existence with another higher temperature, less greedy, set of beings.  Keeping humans cool, comfortable, and wealthy with electrical power would not seem to be in Gaia's interest as much as just getting rid of us all as promptly as possible.  In short;  I think it is a nice thought provoking book and an easy read and I give it 4 stars for that.  But it sure didn't convince me of anything at all so it isn't getting that fifth star.  It would have to be far more consistent and cogent to change me to a Gaia worshipping post-humanist and earn a five star rating 
 These books are really great stories for children who have big imaginations.  They are well-written and exciting without being inappropriate for audiences of 5-9 years.  There really is a "secret" revealed in this last book.  It is a must-read for anyone who has read the others in the series 
 I came into this book with some interest in learning to identify birds around the yard to a greater extent. This is the first book that I've seen to go beyond the basics of shape and color. It's actually a virtual biology lesson on birds with fine details about feathers, and molting among other topics. Very detailed materials that help the reader understand how to see the parts of the bird beyond quick impressions in order to make identifications. But I also gained a new insight into an animal that I took for granted just seeing every day. Sibley is an incredible artist and liberally demonstrates his concepts with sketches and drawings of a wide variety of birds. The combination of beautiful art, and clear, educational writing makes one of the best introductions I've ever seen to birds, and how to know and appreciate them. Highly recommended for the casual as well as serious bird enthusiast 
 Just finished this book in 2 days..I couldn't put it down and when the kids weren't bugging me I'd sneak a few pages in.   Loved it! I love her show, her cook books, and now her as a person even more.   She's real, honest and just throws it all out there for you to read.  Love it or Leave it!   She is who she is and if you don't like her, get outta here!   I just adore her.   I think she has passed up a lot of years in a bad marriage, and agoraphobic, so now I wish her much peace, love and happiness.   She certainly has paid her dues and should enjoy everything she has and will receive!    Buy the book, you won't be disappointed!   it's a great read 
 Christopher has made my favorite time of the year come alive with all the color of fall.  Deep browns, orange, red, greens and the actual feeling of the season come through in this collection of spectacular photographs.  He has used some very interesting techniques to create images and colors that at the same time capture and enhance nature's beauty.    This is a unique and truly wonderful coffee table book that inspires and amazes with the feelings and spirit of the peaceful and mysterious passing of summer into fall.  Well done! 
 Initially put off by the miniature edition I'd ordered by mistake, I now must recommend it. We have an older hardback that my daughters love, and this small, fur covered version is another hit. My 15 month old loves to hold a little book in her hands that feels 'all soft and all warm' 
      I was a little tired of studying one day years ago and decided to pick up something entirely different and read it instead.  I did a random search for whatever words came to my fingertips first. I was away at college and feeling a little homesick I guess.  As I recall, the words included "moonlight", "home", and "dream".  I got back Twelve Moons, House of Light, and Dreamwork.  That started my romance with Mary Oliver.      I'm aware that many people say her imagery is too rich, too luxurious, and that it is not so much elemental as "stock".  I also believe that that's like criticizing Tchaikovsky or Strauss or Puccini for being too melodic, too beautiful, too sad, too delightful.      I see no reason to believe that popularity and artistic value must be inversely proportional.  Quite the contrary, I wish that more people could know about this wonderful woman to whom I am so deeply grateful 
 Our 6 yr old granddaughter is a big reader now and loves the books and the series.  Only objection I have is to using some words such as "stupid" which she is not allowed to use in her school 
 Without a doubt, the book is amazing, and if you ever have the chance to listen to Gardner Grover's reading of the unabridged audio version of Irving's masterpiece, do it. Sometimes, the voice of the person relating a story is just as important as the story itself. That is certainly the case with "The Cider House Rules." Grover captures every nuance just right. His reading is flawless and there is NO sloppy transition between dialogue and narrative. He is a perfect Dr. Larch and wonderfully captures the innocence of Homer Wells as well. I listen to books on tape when I walk my dog and I can assure you, I was always walking down the street with a perpetual smile on my face while listening to this one. This is a perfect companion to the novel itself (the movie was wonderful as well!) and I cannot recommend it enough. Though the running time is 25 hours, you will be amazed at how fast you fly through it...and you WILL want to listen to it again. For another phenomenal (and epic) book on tape, look into Ann-Marie MacDonald's reading of her own novel, "The Way the Crow Flies." (also a 25 hour running time 
 The books arrived so quickly that I got to take my time  wrapping the books. 
 As I went through A Fan's Notes I couldn't stop thinking of it as a sequel to J.D. Salinger's famous coming of age novel The Catcher in the Rye. From the utter lack of direction to his search for the ideal and deeper meaning to life, Fred Exley is every bit the Holden Caulfield. Exley details his life of alcoholism, his dreams of making it big on Madison Avenue and marrying the perfect girl with the golden thighs, his numerous trips to his mother's davenport, the mental asylum and back again, his mindless endeavors with the mysterious Mr. Blue, the Counselor and anyone else he can hit up for money, and of course his infatuation with the inimitable Frank Gifford.   Though it may read like one man's rant about a wasted life and lost opportunities, A Fan's Notes is a reflection of people's universal albeit often doomed quest to escape anonymity, and ultimately matter in this world. Exley's insatiable desire for fame and not so subtle rebellion against society are his ways of attempting to be "more than a mere fan in this life." Oppressed by the shadows of his father and his fellow USC grad Frank Gifford, Exley is consumed by his need to escape. However, he is also haunted by the harrowing superficiality and phoniness of the reality. Unable to reconcile his pursuit of purpose and his ideal vision of the world, Exley sinks into depression and finds himself sustained only by alcohol and football.   By his own admission, Exley is stuck in the past or rather past-present, utterly incapacitated by the continuous wave of change. This book should serve as a warning to people's indulgence in self-pity and constant comparison with false heroes. Indeed it was only after Frank Gifford's debilitating injury that Exley was able to come to terms with his life and accomplish the one act that now defines his life- writing A Fan's Notes 
 This book is great.  It gives many pictures and illustrations.  It helped me immensely with my science class. 
 A good read about a very interesting topic.   Because this is a short book, I'm sure it missed too numerous to mention other stories.   The book is written in a style that feels we are peeking into this nearly forgotten world from afar, kinda like looking at the moon with a telescope rather than actually walking on the moon.  I like watching pro football on Sundays and pro wrestling on Thursdays, but this book brought me almost to tears several times, and believe me, I'm not a cry baby 
 I'm so very sorry to see that this book has gone out of print! I'm an  editor and writer and this gem has taught me a great deal about writing in  a genderless way. Plus it has snippits about how our language got the way  it is -- let's bring it back 
 In this re-thinking of the Salem witch trials, Hill doesn't just report facts but rather analyzes the social, religous, economic, environmental and political forces in place at the time in order to come up with a plausible theory regarding the psychological mindset and motives of the parties involved.    This approach works well, because religious fanaticism simply fails to explain how such heinous acts could have been allowed to go on for so long before a stop was put to it. Instead, FH exposes the mental illness that likely set the acusers in motion, the paranoia and religious extremism that allowed them to be taken seriously, and the political and economic opportunism that compelled those in power to attack their enemies via witchcraft allegations.  Someone could certainly level the charge at the author that she is taking liberties in her analysis, but in a sense that is necessary because no one can definitively look back to 1692 and say for certain what was going on in the minds of the accused, the prosecutors and the accusers.  However, LH qualifies her assertions, and they seem quite plausible given the evidence she cites.  One thing that may cause problems for some readers is that Hill never really seems to even consider that the events could have had a spiritual component to them.  Any yet, the historical descriptions of the "fits" thrown by the accusers, fits in which their bodies twist into painful and unnatural shapes, as well as bleeding from the mouth, etc. - would no doubt convince many still today that the girls might have been "possessed".  LH could have delved more into similar cases of hysteria in recent times to show the similarity, although many today would also argue for demon possession as a cause of many of today's psychological disorders.  In fact a middle-ground approach would probably acknowledge that the distinction between psychological disorders and spiritual affliction is perhaps just one of perception.  Another fascinating effect of the book is to cause the reader to draw comparisons to modern day "witch hunts" - i.e. the holocaust, McCarthyism, etc. and to consider what part they would have played if they were present in 1692 and the potential for evil in all of us.  It also makes one consider that the distinctions between guilt and innocence, victim and perpetrator are quite vague.  Overall a disturbing yet fascinating, well researched and well written telling and analysis of the events of 1692 in Salem.    Highly recommended!  
 Based on a series of lectures Fukuyama delivered at Yale University in 2005, this learned but accessible book presents an even-handed account of why the Bush administration's foreign policy vision of America as a "benevolent hegemon" has proven both practically and ideologically disastrous.  A precise thinker and careful writer, Fukuyama is not merely concerned to demonstrate why this administration's foreign policy has failed (although he does this admirably well); he also posits illuminating suggestions for how America might reframe its hegemony toward more realizable ideals in the post-9/11 world.  By breaking ranks with the Bush-neoconservative consensus on the war in Iraq, Fukuyama is afforded that rare quality of insight: a cast-off who can no longer identify with the brand of neoconservatism that has been used to justify this war as part of America's mission to spread democracy the world over.  This unique perspective allows Fukuyama to think through the implications of the Bush doctrine not by reverting to tried-and-true "critical" sound bytes (of which Democrats are particularly guilty) but by actually revisiting the neoconservative legacy in its most robust and coherent form.  Fukuyama engages the intellectual history and philosophical roots of neoconservatism (Kristol, Strauss, Wohlstetter) to show that the Bush doctrine has consistently violated the neoconservative tenet that a state power must "distrust...ambitious social engineering programs" (49).  Fukuyama then links this sound intellectual critique to policy analysis of the making of a twenty-first century world order.  In this second part of the book, Fukuyama's contention is that the "benevolent hegemon" theory of American power is fundamentally flawed in its ignorance of policy matters of institutional, political, and economic development in modernizing countries.  Fukuyama ultimately suggests it's *these* matters that constitute the decisive elements in both the spread and containment of global jihadism.  Without attending to such matters, any U.S.-led intervention will not only fail to attract immediate supporters but may even breed its own self-fulfilling prophecy, where more people become attracted to the types of extremism that take root in local disaffection.  In this sense, the continuing failure of the Iraqi reconstruction has been the failure of the Bush administration to account for the kind of ground-up institution-building that is the essence of so-called "regime change."  Even if you disagree (as I do), politically or intellectually, with the "traditional" neoconservative points that Fukuyama comes to embrace *against* the Bush-neoconservative consensus, it's the quality and precision of his analysis--the deep insights that his beliefs allow him to make--that one should respect as an open-minded reader.  This book also deserves top billing for surveying the key topics in our political world--uni- vs. multilateralism, development discourse, and sundry geopolitical hot spots--in a way that's both accessible and relevant to the analysis outlined above.  For these reasons, even a self-identified progressive like me found this to be a stimulating and debate-provoking (rather than debate-foreclosing, as is wont among radical neocons) read.  Highly recommended to all 
 Realizing that at least some people might want to know if the book is a good read or not, I'll write a review that hopefully wont read like the opener to a thesis on early american literature:  Here goes...  I liked it!  I thought this Mellville guy writes and interesting and egageing story.  Perhaps he does go into details that the story doesn't need, but even his tangents on trees and fruits, etc. are well written.  Worth the money, worth the time, and worth the attention.  Plus, there is the added benefit of acting like a literature snob on a review.:)  Its a book, people.  Relax, and enjoy 
 Scott's venture into the gothic genre is problematic, but Bride of Lammermoor is strikingly effective in creating suspense and unease within the framework of a crucial period in Scottish history.  The Edinburgh edition's return of the novel to its original pre-Union setting casts fascinating new light on Scott's intentions 
 A friend of mine recommended this book to me because she is crazy (not literally) about Thom as a person. I think of myself as a strong and powerful woman who is not fear based and approached the reading in this manner. I saw myself in several of Thom's clients. I came away with practical ideas and have written down several questions he provided in the book to keep in front of me. One question was my subject line and the other one is, "What are some things I can learn from this situation."  Thom has a great gift for writing as though he's in conversation. He has wonderful humor woven throughout the book; and I really felt like I knew him on a personal level after finishing the book. What a humble guy! I would want to be in therapy sessions with him just to get a laughter fix, along with life lessons 
 In writing an overall account of history such as this, what matters is the capacity for synthesis and re-interpretation, and Roger Collins certainly has both.  But he also has the faults of his virtues.  He manages to cover all important features of the enormous period under observation; he is familiar with modern scholarship; he is an excellent writer; and he is constantly questioning his material and searching for new interpretation.  On a number of issues, his views are not only interesting but revelatory; take for instance his account of the barbarity and self-serving mendacity of Charles Martel, or of the real role of Aetius in the end of the Western Empire.  However, his constant questioning of the issues can take the form of being contrary for its own sake; and some of his preconceptions are unacceptable.  In particular, he pushes the issue of Roman influence on the conquering Germanic war bands so far that, in effect, any notion of Teutonic cultural autonomy vanishes into a phantom, and we are left wondering why, if everything of importance from monarchy to law-codes had been borrowed by the Teutons from the Romans, the political structures of the Dark and Middle Ages are so different from the Roman one - not only in scale, but in kind.  This is a fine and thoughtful account of a large area of our history, but I would not take it without taking in some contrary views as a balance 
 If you didn't like the eighties music, don't torture yourself. If you did, I believe you will have a enjoyable trip down memory lane. Personally, I have enjoyed many of the 'unplugged' approaches and most of the work on this compilation is at a minimum, not bad. It is choppy and obviously not intended to be released together, but this only makes you tolerate a few questionable songs and then you get to hear some pretty good 'revisions'. I think that Rick Springfield's Jesse's Girl ruins it for you as the first track because he did a great job of changing the song without losing the song. They include Heart and 'These Dreams' which I believe is a off ..The Road Home.. a CD that any Heart fan must have in their collection. Again, if you love eighties music, I think you will want to add this one to the collection 
 It was exciting to find out that Jeffrey's put out new material and this CD is definitely one to add to your R&B collection. His version of "People Get Ready" is better than the original because it's delivered with in the sassy style that Jeffrey's known for. I hope he continues to put out new material: he's an underrated legend 
 This is the first book I read on intuitive eating.  It really made a lot of sense to me.  I researched intuitive eating online, looking at the relevent studies.  There's not much research, yet, but the research does support intuitive eating.  Just knowing that diets fail 95% of the time, on average, tells the story right there.  I jumped right into this eating approach with both feet about a month ago.  When I started this diet I was a restrictive eater/binge eater.  I was about 10-15 pounds overweight.  I weighed myself one to four times a day.  I never kept any food in the house that might truly make me want to eat a lof of it.  Then, when I was out and had access to food that I craved, I would binge heartily.  I'm extremely knowledgeable about nutrition, and only allowed myself to keep whole grains, no trans-fats, etc. in the house.    I really thought that I had a very healthy approach toward food.  Then, I started intuitive eating a month ago.  At first, it was stadium franks, hot dogs, chocolate, cream horns, turnovers, and a lot of them.  I weighed myself recently, and found that I had only gained 3 pounds after eating this way to my heart's content.  I stopped when I felt satisfied, and only ate when I felt hungry.    Just recently, do I feel the need for sugar/fat tapering.  I'm starting to crave strawberries and cooked cabbage.  I'm down to 2 cream horns a day, instead of 5.  I don't even care to eat most of the other sugary food I keep around.  I have to throw it out.  My pants are starting to feel like they're loosening back up slowly.  I can't believe it.  I'm 33.  I've obsessed about my eating, dieted and binged (sometimes on a daily basis) for the past 18 years, only to weigh more than ever.    Now, to be surrounded by the food I always craved and binged on, and to not even want it is amazing!!!!  I can't support this concept enough.  Trust you body!!!!  It knows what it's doing 
 The book, House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros is an interesting book. I really do not understand why on some of the critiques people say they did not understand the book. I think it is very meaningful book. If you pay attention to it, there are many messages that Sandra Cisneros wrote on her book. I like this book very much because there are some stories that relate to my life, and I understand the concept of what she is talking about on her book. If there is, one thing that I did not like was that the book has many characters that I have to keep up 
 I had never read any of Pat Buchanan's books before, and had only seen him on some talk circuits and heard him on the radio.  From the moment I began this engaging book a newfound respect for Pat began to emerge. The flow of the book balances nicely with presenting history and astonishing birth rate facts without weighing down the reader.  The layout from start to finish was brilliantly executed.   There is so much information in here that one can't help but come away with a new and refreshed perspective in everyday life. Marxism truly has etched its way into our country and he explains just how it began and why, and where it is leading. Having read "Animal Farm" and the likes, his book really brings home in intellectual fashion just how our society quickly follows those that would lead us astray. We truly have lost the plot, and it is a frightening thought.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to see our country become great again. Moral decay and the loss of patriotism have helped create our now godless society. If we are to continue on this path it will only lead to our destruction, just like other great societies and nations of the past. 
 I very much enjoyed this book (until the ending) --- It was fast reading as I wanted to see what was going to happen to this poor little orphan girl  This book made me realize how something can be too good to be true (or someone) and how it is vital for one to use wisdom before embarking on major decisions  Hope others will enjoy it as much as I did 
 I just watched my new Ice Age DVD and was delighted. Most of us like the film and I am extremely pleased with the transfer to DVD. I have a 35" TV and an older Yamaha receiver with Dolby Pro-Logic. I set the listening mode to 70mm and was very impressed with how good it sounded. I would guess the Dolby Digital soundtrack is awesome. The video transfer is gorgeous. I have waited a long time for this film to come out on DVD and I'm very happy to have this two-disc edition.  The KAB score: 9.6 excellent. 
 This is a good beginners bible, for those that are second language or young. It's hard to understand the old English versions, specially since almost no one speaks like that anymore in the United States. This has words that are used in today's language and their easy to understand. For Sunday Church School, I think this bible would be great for the younger ones as they would be able to understand the words a lot better.  I bought this bible because I all ready own an old English version one, and me been second language I found it hard to understand. Then I found this bible and began to read it and understood nearly everything. Although I knew it was not as accurate as the original Old English Version, I was able to read through it with out having to use a dictionary or give it too much though of what they meat, loosing my interest in further reading the bible. Now I actually enjoy reading the bible more than ever and mostly because it's easy to read.  I recommend this bible to those that are beginning or just want a clearer wording to talk it over with other people. I also highly recommend it for second language readers. 
 Crimes committed by misguided souls is a fertile ground for the psychiatrist turned detective, Dr. Alex Delaware.  In this particular story he involves himself with modern day Nazis who have the maturity of six year olds and the criminal mind of Count Dracula combined with racism doomed for failure. That's cliche of modern writers, when they depict the evil and it has become repetetively boring. However, the author uses fascinating English, is quite resourceful with words. The most colorful character is the narcistic father of the girl with the rifle in the schoolyard. Was the father in his self absorption and mad obsessions with technology the cause of the ticking timebomb 
 While I am a fan of Yancey's work, I often find that his books tend to get a little tedious and repetitive about 2/3 of the way through.  I also find myself wondering when he's going to stop rehashing the same doubts that he seems to always write about.  Having struggles in one's faith is normal and good, by I often think he gets on a gerbil wheel and won't get off.  Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised that this book didn't follow this pattern. It was engaging from start to finish, and yes he does quote quite a few writers, but it's not like the book is nothing but quotations with a little writing in between.   For someone who is at a stage in their spiritual life where doubts are creeping from all sides, this is a good book to sit down and read.  The only flaw I would point out is the abrubt way that he ends it.  Maybe this was intentional, to illustrate some point.  But other than that, it was a good book that I will probably pick up and read again some day 
  Yes. I do agree that the 'c' makes things a bit sticky if one is already used to the traditional sigma ( I still write out my words the old fashioned way) and, yes, I persisted in looking up 'c' words in the vocabulary under, yeah,  ... 'c' ... instead of 's.' Very frustrating. If you have never encountered the Greek alphabet prior to this, the big 'c' will be no problem. In any case, if you don't mind putting in the work demanded by this text (blood, sweat and tears is not an exageration), I must say that this text excels at the task of teaching this very difficult language. The language (and its beauty)is all about detail and the precision with which the Greeks went about creating their personal representation of their conceptual take on the world in general. It is not just about reading skills. The way the language is structured can tell you as much about the people as can their composition. I also used additional resources for help when clarification was indicated, but this became my main text. You might also try (perhaps simultaneously) to utilize the _Thrasymachus_ text and its outstanding associated (and perhaps simpler) website area (Google Thrasymachus ancient Greek for details). By the way, I did attempt a number of other texts, none of which compared to Betts 
 Really excellent live cd.  Green Day sounds really amazing.  Having seen them live myself I can say that they do put on a really incredible show and sound just as great as they do on this cd.  Half the songs are devouted to the American Idiot cd while the remaining numbers cover their vast back catalog and a cover.  I wish Green Day would put out a double cd of live performances.  They have so many great songs I would love to hear.  The dvd is good, but I don't like the editing and it doesn't flow like a real concert.  All in all, this is a good buy 
 I loved this book- it was fantastic and sad, about the life of fiction writer Richard Yates. It made me want to read most of his books and then also read the writers who most impacted his own career. A fascinating read and very worthwhile 
 This is a fabulous book, explaining in a clear but philosophical manner the crisis modern art finds itself in. If you've ever wondered WHY so much of modern art is ugly,  offensive, boring, text-and-technology driven, then here's the book for you.  If you worship at the altar of Pop Art, then you shall be discomfitted.  And you shall squirm as the author analyzes the core meaning behind the art of icons like Duchamp (even Courbet), and what this anti-art-street-art-spectacle-art has led to(it all seemed marvelous at the time). But never fear, there seems to be hope at the end of the tunnel (end of book), though the examples of paintings by the New Old Masters left me a bit cold....(if this is our hope, then.....).  Kuspit is fair, and generous in his list of what he considers "good" art to be. He gives Abstract Expressionism its due, as well as speaking the very word "beauty." I applaud Donald Kuspit for laying it on the line - the Emperor Has No Clothes. We have observed for years that modern painting, more than any of the other art forms (music, poetry, dance, literature) has painted itself into a strange, dull corner. It seems, for a host of traumas and reasons, unable to address the spiritual.  
 After hearing nearly all the Steel Pulse, Peter Tosh, and Bob Marley records, I wondered where else there was to go. Fortunately, someone let me know about this classic record. The songs are uniformly excellent, Bunny is outstanding on vocals, and the band (which includes a young Bob Marley) weaves a steady groove throughout. It's amazing how low a profile this record maintains given its extremely high quality. If you like reggae, you gotta have this. 
 I bought it to go snorkeling, but after a few days a realize that it can be very useful for rainny days as well to protect the camera. Very very useful 
 These were very nicely packaged, arrived quickly and undamaged.  I feel this is a very good product and would fit most oil bottles (I work with them a lot).  I am using mine already and it does not leak, fits well, and is of good quality.  I recommend this product 
 This debut album by Christopher Cross is definately his very best work and a masterpiece. His albums that would follow, would never reach the status of this one, in quality and his best work. Every song on this album is great and actually, this album in itself, could be considered his greatest hits, in my opinion. I just love the sound of all of these songs and it brings back vivid memories of 1980, which for me was an exciting year, anyway. I'd definately recommend it to anyone that loves late 70's-early 80's soft rock 
 Almost indescribable beauty, presented with love, respect, and awe.  Large, fine, glowing plates that qualify as true romantic art, a presentation of the world as it can and ought to be, without shame or guilt.  An uplifting and reverent homage to the human being with emphasis on the young female form 
 I love Pastor Troy, my brother turned me on to him. This album is my favorite, and my favorite cuts of the album is: Outside Ho, and Make em get that money right! Those are just two of the tightest songs on there. He did his thing on this album. I was pleased 
 I was really surprised to learn about the sodium/potassium balance that plays such a big role in cellulite. I was very impressed with the author's encouragement to eat raw fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds and sprouts etc. I have been studying (and practicing) raw foodism for a little while on and off and considering this book was written in 1995 (and that was the second edition!) I am truly glad to see that the raw food movement is - once again - not a new concept and truly is the best way to eat. The ideas that she presents are fairly basic, but then again, she has an almost vegetarian way of eating which also is encouraging. Even though some of what she writes would seem obvious, it goes beyond. It's worth purchasing and seeing if it makes a difference in your life. 
 Being an avid Parents magazine subscriber, I turn through their pages every month searching for advice from parents across the country. It's almost like sitting in a room, sharing your best ideas with hundreds of  other parents. Although Parents magazine features this every month, it's  amazing that they've created an entire BOOK about this useful information.  At least one in five of these tips could work for you. Creativity from  around the nation combines into these pages to provide you with  unforgettable hints and tips to make parenting a LITTLE easier and more fun  for the kids. I've learned a lot in the past two years from just other  parents' advice and strategies. It also helps you stimulate alternative  ways of disciplining your children. I recommend this book to all parents  willing to learn a little more about themselves and their children. Instead  of arguing and cleaning up, you'll spend more quality time with the little  people you love 
 Instead of all the usuall junk and rehash that is in most, if not all books Ralph Martin takes a different view. He studys how the father and his ways affected the sons and how this made for a strangely dynamic family group. He ( Martin)  probes into the mindset of each generation and how each tragedy or world event changed each member. Fascinating to see each of the sons grow and how they were raised differently and influenced by different members of the family 
 I guess that the reason that I enjoyed the book the most is because I am in law enforcement (a Cold Case Squad to boot) and it is a relatively accurate portrayal of how cold cases are investigated. I also must say that I have read the Lincoln Lawyer by Connelly, but none of his novels involving Bosch. I enjoyed it immensely.   Harry Bosch has come out of retirement to join his old partner, Kizman Rider to solve a case. Now a member of the open-unsolved unit, Bosch sets out to solve how killed Rebecca Verloren, a bi-racial girl killed 17 years earlier. All they have is a cold hit (CODIS)and a name.  It would seem that a group of skinheads and racist may be responsible for her death. Now the hard part begins, actually investigating the case and making the arrest.  As the story unravels, we learn about police politics, animosity amongst officers, and a host of interesting facts about life within the department. We also learn how the death of a child can destroy a family. It would appear that Rebecca's family did not have enough to deal with loving each other during a time when interracial relationships were difficult, but having a daughter die only to find that she kept secrets.  The father, once a successful restaurateur, now cooks for the homeless after becoming an alcoholic. The mother has become a recluse, lives with several cats, and maintains her daughter's room as she left it.  I have found personally when investigating cold cases that you do find family members frozen in time and life because there was no "closure". So I know how Rider and Bosch feel coming years later to give a family hope that something is going to happen to resolve all of their guilt and anger. This is an awesome responsibility and task, and I thought that Connelly wrote it well. But what was most interesting about the novel and the case was just how everything is not what it seems. I wasn't necessarily shocked at the end when the killer is revealed, but I know how investigators can have one idea about a case and follow it, only to find out that they have the wrong idea. I enjoyed this Connelly novel and intend to read the next one.  
 As the first plugged-in Miles record (even if only one song features electric piano and bass), this album is not so much the harbinger of things to come as it's often portrayed, but an interesting set of ideas in space.  Miles and his second quintet could easily blow you away with phrasing, lyrics lines and solos, but this record has a certain understatement to it, especially Paraphenalia.  While Tony William's drumming is always just bubbling up but never quite ready to explode, Miles and Wayne Shorter repeat the head -- cutting in and out but keeping Williams and guest George Benson from taking the track away from the subdued groove.  "Black Comedy" is the busy track on the record, also featuring Tony Williams and strong soloing from Mr. Miles.       In the extensive Miles Davis canon, MILES IN THE SKY is often bypassed in favor of NEFERTITI or FILLES DES KILIMINJARO, its immediate predecessor and follower, respectively.  That's certainly a shame, as this record more than stands on its own.  I would even go as far to recommend this record as a starting point for new Miles fans -- you get a very well rounded view of what Miles has done, is doing at this moment, and will do in the future.  Best of all, it's often budget-priced (for some reason I cannot understand) and a very worthy addition to any music fan's library 
 Kinzer is an excellent story teller.  All the Shah's Men was a great read, that was as exciting of a thriller as any novel in recent memory.  Overthrow is very similar in style and is of the same high quality as the previous work.  In Overthrow, Kinzer shows how corporate influence on American foreign policy is nothing new, how America has always practiced its own brand of imperialism and that the cause of our actions overseas have ramifications that are much longer lasting than what the initial effects may lead us to believe.  A must read 
 This is a great book for any level of gourd artist. Not only does it showcase many different artists and styles, it also has a step-by-step project from each one of them.  As a gourd artist and president of our local gourd club I am always looking for new material to use or to present to our club.  This is one of my favorite books, and I do have all the gourd books I can get my hands on. When I took my copy to our meeting many of our members couldn't wait to get a copy of their own. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in working with hard-shell gourds 
 well, in short, BAM opens a door with music thats not easy to come by for normal USA shoppers. With the price of imports he does the world a favor & gives a taste of whats happening overseas on the charts. thanks BA 
 Is there a better Hollywood musical? I don't think so! Julie Andrews is phenomenal! 
 Great characters and fast paced. I listened to the book on CD while driving, and enjoyed it very much 
 Well this is their latest release, and as always, they always come up with great stuff! Nothing spectacular, but it's always good. For sure, their better days were back then with Glory of the Brave and Legacy of Kings, but this one is a bit better than Renegade. Their music shows more maturity but it's still the same kinda medieval influenced stuff. Check out "Hearts on Fire", "Crimson Thunder" (one of the best song I heard), "On The Edge of Honor", "Dreams Come True", "Hero's Return" and "The Unforgiven Blade" 
 Raising our grandson now 10 years old is a challenge anyway but as a gifted child is even more demanding.  The book information helps us undestand the heightened behavior displayed because he is a boy - an athletic and smart boy that at age 10 has a good handle on the real world.   Thanks for the book 
 So they forever listened...........But listen tracks 7 and 8 entitled 8 07, isn't that the music playing while Tom Cruise was givin' it to Rebecca DeMorney on the train in "Risky Business"? Track # five sounds like something from the Goonies,(when the bells chime in). 9 25 is my fave, as well as  4 14.  A great listen; Tom Middleton is top notch 
 Everybody out there keep buying Garfield books! They can be worth a lot of money someday and can become collector's items! I'm always going to keep all of mine so when I have kids they can read them 
 This is your best way to purchase these!  These are all we use and we love them! 
 Fearing must be the greatest unknown American poet of this century.  He captures the ethos of modern urban life as no one else ever has.  His work has a noir sensibility and finds an analogue in the city scenes of Edward  Hopper 
 Sticking to the Union is a delight! Ms. Polishuk definitely has a gift for making Julia Ruuttila's words sing, and I very much appreciate her journalistic attention to detail with respect to the places where the oral history diverges from recorded history.  Viewing the immensely important Pacific Northwest labor movement through Julia's eyes with Sandy Polishuk as a guide is like a well-crafted gourmet meal.  Delicious, satisfying, nourishing, and extremely educational 
 I enjoyed this movie because it had both suspense and entertainment in it and an excellent cast.  I highly recommend it 
 But still a decent mix, incorporting a few of the notable track from the movie.  Anyone know what song is playing when when DJ Snaz makes his successful fade 
 I read this book in my Literature class where we began a journey into the life of Joseph Merrick(The Elephant Man). Merrick was born physically deformed that would scare anyone but had the most pure heart. This play is about how society drove this man into obsurity to hide his hideous face under a burlap sack until his oversized head falls back and he dies a most poetic death 
 "We have plans.  Then something happens."  Sammy has plans: to go to college, to get out of the barrio, to love Juliana.  Although Sammy and Juliana in Hollywood takes place in the Hollywood barrio of Las Cruces, New Mexico, in 1968/69, it is a timeless story of teen hopes and fears, love and loss, and what it is like to grow up poor and of color.  Sammy, called The Librarian by his friends for his scholarly ways, falls in love with Juliana the summer before his senior year.  By summer's end, she has died tragically and senselessly, and Sammy "[doesn't] care.  Not about anything.  Not anymore."  But despite his anger and the pain of his loss, the demands of his friends and his family only increase in his senior year and Sammy is pulled into their lives.  These are real teenagers, who drink, party, take drugs, have sex, swear, push the limits of school administrations and the law.  Sammy agrees to be campaign manager for Gigi who is running for student body president on a platform of "shakin' up the school."  Some of his friends face the draft and service in Vietnam, and everyone knows that poor Hispanic boys of Hollywood come back in pine boxes.  Two friends are brutally beaten for being gay.  One friend dies of heroin addiction.   His father is injured in an automobile accident.  Things happen. Sammy maneuvers through the minefields of student elections, drugs, protests, racism homophobia, and loss and finds a resiliency he doesn't know he has. Like all teenagers, he thinks his life will start when he gets to college.  But he is deeply involved in the life of Hollywood.  Saenz has found an authentic voice in Sammy who is full of the angst and confusion of all teenagers but is also perceptive, sensitive and compassionate.  This is a beautifully realized story of what it meant in 1968 to grow up in the barrio.  Today, teens growing up in the ghettos face the same problems Sammy and his friends faced.  
 I love Speed.  It is brainless fun that I can watch over and over.  Having it on Blu-ray and watching it on my Sony 1080p HDTV is pure heaven.  Audio and picture quality are excellent, striking really, since it is such an old movie.  Blu-ray rocks!! 
 It is almost unbelievable, how this book could ever have raised a scandal, whereas it deals with love in a most human and indeed loving way. This tells us more about earlier readers than about the author. Everybody who is able to abandon the carthesian beliefs that ruined pleasure in enjoying life in the flesh as well as in the spirit will enjoy this masterpiece of literature. 
 I find this book very helpful.  It is a step by step guide for sisters  hungry for success.  I look forward to reading Cheryl Broussard's third  book 
 of course i enjoy this movie, i ordered it after so many years of searching for it... i love salsa music and the dancing.. 
 Having read most of Grisham's books, I've saved a few of his "best" for last.  While it wasn't a 5 star book like I'd hoped, it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one.  Having saw the movie years ago, I had a good idea of what the book was about:  Two Supreme Court Justices are killed, a law school student, along with many other people become curious and try to figure out "who dun it"...only, she writes a brief and hits the nail on the head, and when the wrong people find out, she's on the run for her life!  I enjoyed the book mostly because it was fast-paced, and had a lot of detail.  So much detail and characters, I had a bit of a struggle to keep up!  Of course it was suspenseful and the characters, especially of Darby, the law school student and the reporter who starts to help her uncover the truth.  Good read 
 From Columbus boyhood to his discovery voyage; John Cabot, Henry Hudson, William Penn, Ben Franklyn, Washington, Jefferson, Daniel Boone, Fulton, Morse and the Telegraph, Lincoln, Civil War, Spanish War, Great  Expositions, Panama Canal to the purchase of Alaska... this small volume of  history is, incredible! I was looking for history to supplement our 5th  grade curriculum, and thank goodness for amazon.com search engines or I may  never have discovered this gold. Each chapter concludes with 4-5 open ended  questions, along with pronunciations and definitions of 2-3 words from the  chapter. The chapter's read as though you were peaking in a window, and  then following the characters around, and enjoying it. It's great. I read a  couple chapters to my own 7 year old, and he loved it. I told him (using  the 4/5 questions) what he would he learn from it, i.e. You'll learn where  Christopher Columbus was born, etc.; then I read the chapter, followed with  the questions and he did as well as my students. I've been discouraged by  the presentation of textbooks, for students of all grades, when it comes to  history. I decided to "read" to my students from their textbooks  and other sources (such as this one)because history, afterall, is  storytelling! So I strongly recommend to teachers, parents, homeschoolers,  and students to add a book such as this one to your library, and see the  times as they were, the people, the places, the food, the importance of  events as they happened, and read, read, read this one. Another selection  for those interested in more adventurous people,want more of  the same, get  Stories of Great Americans for Little Americans, by Eggleston, and read up  more on Washington,Franklyn,in their youth along with Daniel Boone, Daniel  Webster, Longfellow, Kit Carson and Horace Greeley. It's fun and exciting  for all to read, you'll see. The true shame today, is how many good books,  older than 10 and 20 years ago, are considered OLD... when it comes to  education & history, I think the older, the more true, and the  better... how about you 
 Tom Wolfe is praised as a brilliant social novelist and I don't read enough of that type of novel to comment on the success of A Man in Full.  I have read Bonfire of the Vanities and now this book, and I found them both to be quite enjoyable.  A Man in Full is similar to Bonfire with sprawling chapters full of thoughts and descriptions of the main characters.  This book is set in Atlanta, where Charlie Croker is an aging real estate developer and former football star.  Croker's financial empire is on the verge of collapse and his personal life isn't going to well either.  As with Bonfire, Wolfe writes about the polically connected, race politics and the very wealthy.  Charlie Croker and friends judge others based on the amount of money they have and the material possessions they own.  Using this criteria to judge others is obviously foolish to all except the most materialistic.  Except for Conrad Hensley, the Croker employee arrested for assault, the poorest main character is a banker named Peepgas who has a Harvard MBA and makes $120,000 a year.  Needless to say, the social arena Wolfe writes about is above that of most readers.  That doesn't mean the book isn't entertaining.  I enjoyed all of the characters and their interaction.    When an all-American African American football player at Georgia Tech is suspected of rape, racial tension threatens to destroy Atlanta.  Croker is about to lose all his possessions to his creditors and his sexy wife half his age isn't too thrilled about it.  Roger White is the black lawyer called on by the black mayor to see if he can get the crusty old Croker to speak out.  Conrad Hensley is the Croker employee who is fired then thrown in jail.  All the plots slowly converge.  This book isn't about action, its about characters.  I give this book 4 stars because it was a satisfying journey with some enjoyable characters.  I was frustrated a few times by how what was important in life was so obvious yet Charlie Croker never did quite get it.  His good ole boy attitude was amusing at times but amazingly ridiculous at others.  It was sometimes appalling how attached he was to appearances and his possessions.  About halfway through the book, I browsed some reviews on Amazon.  A few said they were terribly disappointed in an ending that felt tacked on and that there wasn't any resolution to the plot or to some of the characters.  I disagree.  The book ends by resolving the point that the entire book led up too.  We are given a few sentences about the fate of some of the other characters.  For Wolfe to write entire chapters about everyone else would have taken another 200 pages.  The ending is not disappointing and you won't be let down.  Every loose end might not get the attention you think it deserves, but I give Wolfe the benefit of the doubt and accept this as the story he wanted to tell.   
 I should have read this biography sooner. I used to be in love with his paintings, and even fantasized that IF I were to travel back in time, I would've married him -- all this BEFORE I read this book. After I read it I found out that there was one such infatuated woman (Margot), and also a tragic unrequited love story that led him to  religion and then to painting. Anyone who is creative will sympathize with the extent to which pain can be transformed into the strength to create. The creative path is not always materially rewarding, and even if it is all an artist has, it will continuously change others' lives. I absorbed every word of this book and was hooked until the very end. Poverty and disinterest is ephemeral... belief in oneself is revolutionary 
 This is a great poker book for many reasons.  It is the easiest to read.  In fact I treated it like a John Grisham, can't put it down 'til I'm done book.  It is a great follow up to Little Green Book and Final Table dvd both by Mr. Gordon.  In fact if you wanted to give a multi-media gift to someone the three pack would be cool! But it also works as a stand alone, assuming the reader has some intermediate knowledge of poker.  Mr. Gordon has selected 70+ hands from throughout his poker career, each pointing out some specific subtlety of play (and liberally sprinkled with anecdotes).  You learn why a pro makes plays the way they do. Why is he slow playing here?  Why is he folding KK there?  Your ability to calculate pot odds will improve.  Unlike some other books "written" by pros, every word in this one is truly Phil's because there is no way it could be ghost written.  Good flops 
 If you've ever had that feeling like you were invisible...and wished just one time there was a signal that let you know you were on someone's...anyone's... global positioning system...there is such a signal. It's called a God wink. This book tells you how to find them and tap into them and make them work for you. The author is witty and funny and brilliant at weaving stories together that make you think "Hey, that's me he's writing about!"   I urge you...run...don't walk...and buy this book NOW! It will change your life! 
 I am a biology professor, and I required this text of all of my majors students until it went out of print.  I now tell my students to hunt copies down on Amazon, ebay, or used book stores.   I am a great fan of learning the Latin and Greek roots of words to remembering the meaning of words.  My students have a greater appreciation for the tongue-twisting words that we find in biology. 
 Words like "marvelous," "remarkable," "wonderful," "astounding," "incredible,"  don't even begin to describe this great book.  It really touched home.  A must read for every mother or son 
 This is an excellent book, simple as that. It has information on not only plants, but many other important aspects of aquarium care. It has extensive information on how plants work in the natural habitat, in the aquarium, and how to care for them.   Everything is simple and concise and explained well, the images are great and show exactly what they should. How to trim different plants, how to plant them, how to get rid of algae and making a balance of nutrients in the aquarium and so on. Just examples of what it covers, if you have an aquarium and have plants and just want to know what to do to keep your plants healthy, just get this book 
 This is a very good story written but a great author.  I am so glad that he stayed so true to Asimov's original intentions for the series (unlike Brian Herbert with his Dune books).  It does not read like Asimov though.  This is forgivable because Bear never tried to emulate Asimov's style, he only tried to take Asimov's unfinished story and do the best job he could with his own writing style, which is really a better way to go if you think about it 
 This is an extremely interesting book with wonderful insights of the Human development,  A must in everyone's shelves!!!  
 I just received this book from my Mortgage company, and I thought this could be another boring Mortgage Guidelines textbook. After I read the introduction and contents, I was WRONG, totally wrong. This is a well-written in details explanation for all the Mortgage Professions Guidelines. From 1008, 1003, GFE, TIL to Federal Disclosures forms; from Loan Initialization to Incoming Calculation; from Loan Processing to Closing Underwritting, even a Mortgage Broker/Loan Officer like me, average made 3 million a year of Loan Closing deals, there are still some of Guidelines I didn't get, this book really helps me to figure out and even more deeply understand the Mortgage Lending Procedures and Guidelines. I recommended this book to those who are new to Mortgage business, and even strongly recommended to those who already are Loan Officer Professions, this book REALLY can increase your productions!!! 
  I have read all of Ms. Norton's books, so I qualify as slightly biased.  The plot development, characterizations, and readability of this story make it a joy to all of us who have yearned for a return to her earlier writing style.  I was unable to put it down until I had finished it - all in just one day.  Not many books command my attention span that dominantly in recent years.  The "magic" of old was back...and indeed, welcomed back.  If one has never read any of her books, this can easily be a stand-alone read to introduce you to her many, many previous stories.  As she described herself, a "Teller of Tales". 
 There aren't enough books about Elizabeth Gaskell. D'Albertis has stunningly filled what heretofore had been a Gaskell void. Yea, Dierdre!  This sort of scholarship is rarely seen amongst Victorian scholars,  particulalrly female ones. Fabulous 
 Like Silent Spring, this book surprizes and alarms. It is well written, rarely bogging down, and opens new ways of understanding with almost every chapter - the perils of patchwork preservation, the honeybee as an invading exotic, the concept of nectar corridors for long distance pollinators. Well  done indeed 
 This is a must have guide book for All Mechwarrior andBattletech Fans alike 
 Julia Child communicated with humor, grace and intelligence, her enthusiasim for gourmet cooking in order to revolutionize Americans return to fresh healthy and creative cusine through this excellent cookbook. 
 I cannot believe the wonder of this music. I own several Capercaillie cd's, but this one, by far, has some of the most phenomenal, superior music I have ever listened to. The music is haunting, ethereal, and very sensual. Karen Matheson's voice simply must be what Heaven sounds like. When I die...I hope I end up next to this band...cause it will be eternal bliss 
 I agree with Mr. Sullivan about who cares about some specific sounds at a live performance,... its raw, sweety, aggressive, compasionate, ITS ROCK AND ROLL!! ....today's new soul artist should buy this CD, take notes, and learn from it,.. (r&b singers are too cheezy now...) Listening to this CD, you are going back when the male soul singers were real men,.. no fakes like today's singers who just want to show off high vocal ranges like a bad imitator of Eddy Valen on the guitar. This Live show does not have any pyrotechnics,...and thats why I love it,.. Sam Cooke is by far my favorite soul singer... (I dont have nothing else to say,... so BUY IT NOW! 
 This book is fantastic in regards to the military life and a profound understanding of military philosophy. It may not apply to civilians trying to understand the military. But I do recommend this book for reading 
 This is an amazing film especially because it is one of the first of the independent films to break through the glass ceiling versus studio films. It is a great film to see for anyone who wants to write their own script or yearns to turn their own novel or life story into a movie. Nostalgic look at coming of age through a summer experience of awe. Jennifer Grey is hauntingly warm and amazingly open in her performance. Patrick Swayze remains eternally sexy. Dance is simply a vehicle for showing passion and expression especially in a generation gap world like the surroundings of where they work in the Poconos. This film has a heartbeat that just keeps on going -- kind of like the Energizer bunny-- you can watch it at different phases of your life and find that it reminds you of something in the past yet at the same time hints at the potential for your future even if you can't waltz or Foxtrot your way to the same spotlight they chose 
 1.Fall Children 5/5 This song slowly transforms from a slow, ballad type deal, into a totally fast paced frenzy! AFI does this sorta thing all the time, and I haven't seen any band do it better than AFI. Awesome song! FALL CHILDREN!!! 2.Halloween 5/5 In my opinion, even better than the original Misfits version! Alot more energetic, and there's elements of Davey's voice that Glenn Danzig didn't pull off in the original. I love this. 3.The Boy Who Destroyed the World 4/5 It's cool. I'm not a huge fan of the transition in the middle of the song though. It's just not my favorite. The lyrics seem to tell a story of a young man who took revenge on the world. 4.TotalImmortal 5/5 My personal favorite song on this CD. It's awesome. There aint much else to say about it. Overall: Not AFI's best release, but does that mean that it's bad? Hell no 
 This book is extremely helpful in finding the correct fit for your horse.  She covers many types of saddles, including treeless, and pads.  It could save you a lot of $$$ in the long run 
 I loved this movie I have watched several time and am currently letting my brother and his wife watch it 
 If I could give this album 7 stars I would. The Downward Spiral is the best album of 1994 and definitely top ten of the 90s. The album which charts the journey of a man's sanity and insanity came out during a time in music when every genre was mostly fragmented and this work of art helped meld elements like post-industrial techno beats and hard and noise rock. I just want to clear something up a reviewer said about one of the tracks about this album. The reviewer said something in reference to "big man with a gun" with its "anti-gun toting lyrics" The song is actually a satire about rap music that Reznor wrote in the midst of gangsta rap which was huge in 1994. The song is all about the state of hip-hop then and even now. That being said, I'll continue with my synopsis of this album. The best place to listen to the album is on your headphones connected to a home stereo during an electrical storm. 
 This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. When I first heard about this book, I thought I might cry throuhout the book, but that didn't happen, i only shed tears in one of the chapters. Still this is one of the most moving books I have ever read. It grabs you, especially if you have gone through real love. You will echo with all things she is decribing when she is talking about her emotions towards him.   One point towards the end of the book, I had to put it down and go run some errands. I got into the car and forgot how to drive. It was that powerful.   I loved it. I would like to read it in Italian.  
 A very compelling look into the life of an amateur boxer; Anasi takes the reader into the gym where white athletes are clearly the minority. He toughs it out with a trainer that at first is less than encouraging to Anasi's style and everything he's ever been taught about boxing. It is by far one of the most interesting books I've read about boxing pro or amateur. No matter how much you know about the sport, you will learn something new from the perspective of Anasi.      
 A ton of batteries for cheap...they work great. Always good to have bulk stock on batteries. Pleased with how many come in pkg 
 Patsy Cline will always be considered one of this country's best female vocalists.  Her distinct sound and style made her songs instant classics.  The 12 songs compiled here are her best works, in my opinion.  If you want to hear how singing should really be done, add this one to your collection.  You won't be disappointed. 
 Dark Horse has outdone themselves yet again with this excellent new Conan series. In spite of the character having been around for decades and gone through many incarnations in books, comics and movies this series makes you believe you are reading Conan for the first time. The artwork is superb and perfectly captures the quality of Conan's world. A more classic style is used that will make you think of Frazzetta in some places, but is very original nonetheless. The coloring is a standout also with its painterly effect. This compilation gathers the first 7 issues of Dark Horse's Conan series, starting with the excellent "The Legend" which sets the tone for the rest of the comic using parts of Robert E. Howard's own prose. The story arc that follows has Conan searching for the fabled land of Hyperborea where all is milk and honey (or so the tales tell) on the way Conan is joined by a band of Aesir, and battles a couple of Frost Giants along the way. Upon reaching Hyperborea, Conan finds out the truth of this magical kingdom and the evil that lurks there. This story has all the elements that Conan is: savage swordplay, evil wizards, giants and of course, scantily clad babes. You just can't go wrong 
 This book brings to the reader the thrill of discovery. Mike Novacek takes you along beside him as he makes some of this century's biggest discoveries and then sends you back in time to the Gobi when dinosaurs, lizards and early mammals lived and died together. If your passion is palaeontology, or you are just merely interested in prehistoric life, this book is a must 
 This one starts off kind of dry - lots of technical psychobabble, but it is interesting - in an arid kind of way. Alex is called in on a consult to evaluate a situation involving a little 2 year old girl. Cassie has been in and out of the hospital multiple times and no one can figure out why. Is it a case of Munchausen by Proxy? Is Cassie's mother making her own child ill just for attention? It's an ugly suspicion and Alex feels very duplicitous in his evaluation - becoming friendly with Cindy, the girl's mother, in order to spy on her, but the alternative is a dead child, so Alex accepts the challenge.  The truth of the situation is even more heinous and when the bodies start accumulating and the suspect list starts growing, Alex turns to his old pal Milo for help and things get really interesting. Detective Milo Sturgis has been demoted following an assault on a superior officer and he's been relegated to a boring data processing position, but he's moonlighting as a private detective and he uses the police computers for research in order to help Alex with background info on all the players in this potentially tragic drama. And drama it is, complete with cloak and dagger shadow government involvement that borders on scary.  It's great watching Alex toss around all these conspiracy theories while Milo puts it all on the line for his friend. As they both dig, the story they uncover is more convoluted than they could have imagined and when all is said and done, they get help from a very unexpected source.  Like I said, I just love Milo 
 I think this is one of the better Phantom fictions out there. she wrote good characters; I liked the story a lot, except for a few things that bothered me here and there. (minor phantom details that do not hurt the story.) I'm not sure if hers was after the movie or not, (I could be mistaken, though I did find it fitting) however, it does not hurt the story, though somehow I found it a little predictable. I'm not sure Erik would compose himself as such as she has described, but in a way it makes him feel more human, taking away from the entire opera "ghost" persona, which I actually found rather likeable. I still couldn't help but wish for the "old" phantom to shine through a little more though at some points, but he definitely shines through in this book, though I will not say where! she did a great job at making this her own.  I think this is a good one if you've always wondered what happened to the phantom after he walked through the shattered mirror in the 2004 movie by ALW, or what happened to him period. perhaps it will provide an answer for some, as it did for myself 
 Bailey White's book of short stories/narratives that describe crazy relatives and neighbors, interesting experiences with folks traveling through, and the adventures of daily life is a great addition to any reader's collection of southern literature. I particularly loved "Computer Class," which tells the tale of two elementary school teachers who skip out on computer training to go to the dog races.   White has a tender way of writing about all of her "characters." She notes people's eccentricities, but she doesn't judge them or look down on them. In many ways, she seems to delight in all the "differences" that make people (and the world) interesting. A great read. If you like this book, you'll LOVE Mama Makes up Her Mind, which I thought was even better than this one 
 This mattress topper changed my day bed from a lumpy place that I could never get comfortable on to my favorite place to take a great happy nappy!! 
 I purchased this book because I'm taking a 2-day machine quilting class from Paula Reid & it was recommended reading by her.  This book is full of useful information for different styles of quilting and there are exercises to try.  Also included in the back of the book is alot of information about different types of threads and needles.  I'm thrilled to own this book and look forward to the class even more 
 In this debut novel, Clare Clark has combined historical fiction, suspense and a battle for sanity.  From within three levels of darkness (experiences in the Crimean war, working in the sewers of London in the mid 19th century and fighting for his sanity because of his experiences of both) William May may seem an unlikely hero.  Add to the mix a gritty portrayal of life amongst the London poor, the very real events of 'The Great Stink' in 1855 (which ultimately led to the rebuiding of London's sewers) and the stage is set for an interesting novel.    Warning: William May's self destructive tendencies will be very confronting for many. The description, which lends it authenticity, is not for the faint-hearted. Many of us will recognise it and understand it immediately.  I would not recommend this book to the squeamish.  I would recommend it to those who like some factual underpinning for their fiction and who seek to descend into the Victorian underworld.  Jennifer Cameron-Smit 
 "Kaya" was Bob Marley's soft, beautiful, and melodic follow up to the "Exodus" album of 1977.  Released in 1978, "Kaya" was meant to coidncide with the One Love Peace Concert held in April of that year.  While "Rastaman Vibration," and to a greater extent, "Exodus," were fiercly sociopolitical and religious, "Kaya" dealt more with homage to the power of ganja (marijuana) and romantic love.  One thing "Kaya" and "Exodus" do have in common is the strong spirituality, but "Kaya" takes this in a softer direction. The album even sparked Bob Marley & the Wailers' first World Tour, some of which can be heard on the live "Babylon By Bus" album released later that year.  Each song is a classic, from the slow and steady "Easy Skanking," to the soothing "Time Will Tell".  Some of the most notable tracks on the album are the tracks "Is This Love" and "Satisfy My Soul" both featured on the "Legend" compilation.  Another is the remake of the roots classic "Sun Is Shining," originally done with Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh in the late 60's-early 70's as was the title track "Kaya" (meaning "marijuana"), an ode to the herb used so reverently by Marley in his lifetime.  Two very key songs speak of the assassination attempt aimed at him in 1976: the dark and somber "Running Away," and the forgiving, spiritual "Time Will Tell".  Finally, the bonus track "Smile Jamaica [Version]" is a danceable classic, showing the lighter and more playful side of Marley's music.  This album is sure to delight every fan with each song again and again 
 This book is fantastic. It gives the reader history that shows why in both Catholic and Protestant churches healing is almost a taboo subject. Macnutt challenges the reader's own bias against truly believing in healing and then gives the reader tools on how to start seeing healing in his or her own life and in the lives of others. This is good reading. He is a great writer and he and his wife have an incredible healing ministry. He knows what he is talking about 
 Some people have complained that this book wasn't in-depth enough for them...  Well, the book is a guide!  It doesn't claim to be an all-inclusive, comprehensive text.  But it is definitely a great reference tool to learn the sheer basics.  The illustrations and accompanying descriptions for learning the crochet and knit stitches are very good.  Previously, seeing a pattern for a project would have intimidated me.  Now I can understand them and have successfully created some articles that I'm very proud of.    To get you started, I would recommend this book.  It's quite convenient to have to different styles of stitching in a single book.  I have found it to be quite handy as I continue learning to perfect my crocheting and knitting skills.   Again, it's just a primer into these beautiful arts.  You can't expect to become an expert overnight, but you will be able to tackle easy and intermediate projects for sure.  I suppose it all depends on our individual learning styles 
 In this world of horror films, reality tv and just plain mindless junk, this was refreshing.  Oh I know many will say, Ho-Hum another mushy movie...perhaps.  However, once in a while it's nice to see the average man be able to fulfill his dreams, not only for himself, but for this wife, children...family.  We CAN have things to dream about that will come true. I will purchase more films like this 
 My son HAD to have this book and has now read it in its entirety.  He said it was very good 
 If you have only one pan and one book this is it. This book should be the first for everyone who wants to cook. Jamee is the best teacher. This was my first book of hers, also check out Mix It Up! The only book you need for the stand mixer. Do not settle for anything less than what Jamee gives you, the manual. Not just a cookbook 
 I admit that the book is hard to follow.  Nevertheless, I must give it five stars only because of the last chapter Jonas added which showed the connection between existentialism and gnosticism.  Without this chapter, the book merits only one star.  With this final chapter, Jonas discovered gold.  I am amazed how many scholars today, P.h.D's and all, fail to recognize the common vein of gnosticism circulating and giving life to such movements of thought as phenomenology, deconstructionism and existentialism.  Unfortunately, most of the reviewers missed this point 
 Kisscut is a shocking and graphic story that is classic Karin Slaughter.  Slaughter pulls no punches and spares no emotion!  When a young girl is shot and killed, when the body of an unborn infant is discovered, when all around close ranks and no one knows who is to blame or why...... the story is just beginning! The slow revelation of the truth is shadowed by deceit, self mutilation, child abuse and a  denial of basic concepts of trust and love. The final chapters will leave you horrified and stunned, and in light of the recent kidnappings and murders of young girls in Florida, you will realize that Karin Slaughter's message is real and has deadly consequences 
  Guero is definitely enjoyable to listen to, but it still doesn't match Odelay. I like pretty much every song on the album, but some of them are kind of boring to listen to. I don't know why, I just didn't enjoy this album as much as some of Beck's others. Here are my ratings for each song:  1. E-Pro (3:22) - B+ 2. Quï¿½ Onda Guero (3:29) - B+ 3. Girl (3:30) - A 4. Missing (4:44) - A- 5. Black Tambourine (2:46) - B+ 6. Earthquake Weather (4:26) - A 7. Hell Yes (3:18) - A 8. Broken Drum (4:30) - B+ 9. Scarecrow (4:16) - A- 10. Go It Alone (4:09) - A- 11. Farewell Ride (4:19) - A- 12. Rental Car (3:05) - B 13. Emergency Exit (4:02) - B 
 I admit it; I'm one of those who believed in the myth of John and Yoko, so  it was kind of depressing to learn the truth about them. With the exception of being such a brilliant musician, John was a pretty ordinary guy with a lot of personal problems. I think it was John himself who said, had he not been a musician he'd have been a bum. Nevertheless, the story of John's last few months alive makes for very absorbing reading and we're lucky Fred Seaman was there to tell the story 
 I just bought this album today and it's undoubtably one of Jeff Foxworthy's best. It even includes an introduction and encore with Larry The Cable Guy. Git-R-Done 
 This is, I believe, the second or third book I read by Thich Nhat Hanh.  "Living Buddha, Living Christ" sort of inspired me to pick this up.  He gives the basics as to what this whole Buddhism thing is all about.  His explanation is neither too simplified nor to technical for the "average reader".  If you pick up one book on the teachings of Buddha, make it this one.   
 This monitor has been great so far.  It's wide-screen, really thin, and has a sharp picture 
 This is indeed one of the 10 greatest albums ever, of any genre, of any time. The influence of this album reverberated throughtout not only the blues world, but through ever style of music. Numerous artists since have called this one of their greatest influences, and to listen to it as a whole (very important) is to know why. I have only heard the original 9 tracks, which represent absolute perfection of completeness. I have not heard the bonus tracks, so I will not comment on them, though I find I am usually dissappointed in the mediocre crap thrown on the extra space of CDs. Nevertheless, any way possible, the original album must be a part of any great collection 
 "The Who Sell Out" is one among ( at least 3 ) several Who master pieces. With its build up as a commercial radio station program with commercials in between the songs and overall great songwriting, the album may very well be the most varied and most entertaining Who album.  1967 was a year of psychedelia in rock music and the Who were among the pioneers of that trend. This is obvious from the first track of the album "Armenia in the Sky". The outstanding single "I Can See For Miles" is among the very best psychelia songs recorded.   The acoustic "Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand" is another Who favourite - beautiful melody, great rhythm and intelligent lyrics.  Actually the lyrics are overall great on this album  - with wit and homour.  Songs like "Odorono" and "Tattoo" are rarely included on Who compilations - and they're both bound to be great positive surprises to the first-time listener of the album.   "Our Love Was" and "I Can't Reach" are other fine tracks - both more in the style of their previous album "A Quick One".   I might be expected that the short commercials ( most of them musically done ) would be annoying after the first couple listens - but this is really not the case. These short tracks works great in the context of the album.   Only the final two tracks of the original album seem a little out of place. Townshend's acoustic "Sunrise" is quite beautiful, but "Rael" feels somewhat longwinded and dated.  Most of the bonus-tracks are great - most of the apparently were only left out due to lack of space on the vinyl format.   Try to shuffle the tracks - the bonus-tracks really fit in nicely with the originals. 
 If your looking for some great blue-eyed southern soul from the sixties, you've come to the right place. The Box Tops were a band of 5 kids, led by dynamite lead singer Alex Chilton, who was only 16 years old when he joined the group. The band was relegated to doing only one thing, making great music. All the rest of the duties, including the production and most of the songwriting fell on the shoulders of Dan Penn and legendary Stax producer Chips Moman. But the person who wrote the Box Tops best music, including "The Letter, "Neon Rainbow", and "Soul Deep" were done by the great songwriter Wayne Thompson. It may have been pretty much Penn and Moman's show, but it was the gruff-voiced teenager Alex Chilton who took this band to the top of the charts. It seems like all this great music came out at one time in the late 60's. I remember when I was young kid, I used to wait in anticipation for these songs to skirt their way along the airwaves and into my 2 dollar transistor radio. I wasn't satisfied till I heard those words "gimme a ticket for an aeroplane" to come on. That 1:52 of "The Letter" was over all too fast. But I always had those other Box Tops gems like "Sweet Cream Ladies" and "Cry Like A Baby", among the others to look forward to. As quick as this band came with all this great music, they disappeared just as quick without any fanfare, and pretty much without the recognition they, and especially Alex Chilton deserved. I've followed Chilton's career closely over the years since the Box Tops...his voice never was anywhere close to being this good again. But if you want to step back in time and listen to some great and unforgettable Memphis soul, get this best of from the Tops. It's all you need 
 The video quality of this DVD is reason enough to give it 5 stars.  They definately used good cameras to film this movie, and it shows in this DVD.  So it's unusually good for an 80's movie.  The only extras are trailers.  And yes, I could watch this movie over and over, espically the last half hour.  The scenes where someone tries to steal his car and his camera are priceless too 
 Great job again Anchor Bay!!! This rare classic gets the deluxe treatment it deserves with this 2-DVD set!!! Disc 1 has a great anamorphic widescreen tranfser of the film as well as a Audio Commentary from the director!!! Disc 2 has the extra goodies!!! A seventies cult classic with an all star cast!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A 
 this is a very nice, affordable watch.  i like not having to replace batteries and knowing that it will ALWAYS be accurate.  people who own $1000+ watches ask me about it a lot.  when i tell them that it is solar powered and automatically synchronizes with an atomic clock every night, and that i only paid $60 for it while on sale from amazon, they immediately tell me that they paid too much for their expensive inferior watches 
 I first became acquainted with the Bayeaux Tapestry in 1966 when the National Geographic printed the whole thing. I was fascinated!  I have read a bit about the Norman Conquest since then, and Howarth's book is a really good one for anyone who has ever wondered about that event.  I recommend this book wholeheartedly. In fact, this is my second copy.  I lost the first one in a move and was lucky to find it again 
 I have Dungeonmaster's Guide and I love it! I don't have any Dieselboy cds, so this is the best 
 Lost in My Own Backyard enhanced my brief stay in Yellowstone. It informed without being heavy-handed and gave me an idea of some of the areas within the park that I know I'll never get to. The realities are expressed with humor, ("Whenever a creature makes an appearance near the road...there will be a traffic jam of hopeless proportions"). Cahill points out some of the sites that are off the beaten track, such as the petrified tree, that can be fun to see.  His description of the Artist's Paintpots, however, failed to inspire in real life. Lost in My Own Backyard doesn't pretend to be a guidebook.  It's rather like sitting down with a whimsical uncle and looking at his photo album of Yellowstone National Park 
 Her radio show is great, but this book is even better. The Moviemom is smart and funny and not afraid to cross swords with Hollywood in the interests of common sense and good taste.  This is a great book. 
 My wife just loves this book! It's a textbook used in teaching, but my wife references it almost daily 
 Let's face it: chemotherapy is no joke. There are tons (and I mean TONS) of books out there that tell you what to expect when going through chemo, how to eat, how to be an advocate in your care, and a myriad of other related subjects . But there aren't a lot of books that tell you to laugh. Yes, laugh! Laughter is good for the soul. It helps bring energy and zest to life...even when going through chemotherapy. "I'dd Rather Do Chemo" is a great little book that brings a smile to the face and a chuckle (heck, even a guffaw) even on those dark days. The author, who has faced some very dark days herself, has a wonderful philosophy that one can choose to live a sad and depressed life with cancer, or one can live life to the fullest with laughter and looking at the brighter side of life. And yes there are brighter sides. Do yourself a favor--whether you are a cancer fighter, survivor or caregiver--read this gem of a book. It's a winner 
 This is the first of this series that I purchased and I was so surprised.  I had been looking for books that would introduce science concepts to children under 4, and thankfully, this series does it.  I do not think all of the books are equal with their rhyming style, but this is one of the best ones.  This book introduces each of the planets, some constellations, the moon and the sun. 
 Now in a fully updated and expanded third edition, Single-Camera Video Production by Robert B. Musburger (Associate Professor, School of Communication, University of Houston), is a straightforward and highly recommended guide based upon the author's many years of practical field experience to planning, shooting, and editing video productions shot on location with essentially one camera at the filmmaker's disposal. An excellent resource for student filmmakers, Single-Camera Video Production offers a wealth of technical detail on audio signals, the scanning system, digital signal standards, camera controls, microphone types, and more, including sound advice on the social side of shooting film such as directing talent 
 First of all, I may be a little biased: I had Bill over my home back in 1998 during the two days it took to interview one of the x-ray technicians to JFK's autopsy, Jerrol Custer; a very memorable experience (as it was when I was present for the 11/22/91 interview of Custer done by Harry Livingstone for "High Treason 2"). That said, Bill has written a masterpiece: the best single volume of the medical evidence and related matters (a close second would be the medical chapters in "Murder In Dealey Plaza"). Very well written and put together, the book is a bona fide cornucopia of great nuggets of information from FIRST HAND WITNESSES to the autopsy, NOT JUST ANOTHER THEORY; very valuable. While this book would appeal to anyone with an interest in the Kennedy assassination, for those with a particular bent for all things medical, this work is essential reading. I have no complaints. Buy it asap 
 Linda, the main character of The Pursuit Of Love, muses when she hears at long last from her lover, "Life...is sometimes sad and often dull, but there are currants in the cake and here is one of them." She might have been talking about this book. In contrast, these novels are rarely sad and never dull and are generously fruited with some delightfully comic moments.  A literary masterpiece? Not really. No great ideas are discussed, no dramatic themes explored. But for those who appreciate Wodehouse and Waugh, there is much here to enjoy 
 This book filled many voids for me with regard to the history of Cuban baseball. It is especially good in discussing the heyday of Cuban baseball in the twenties and thirties. Like one of the other reviewers, though, I was dissappointed that the author did not discuss baseball since the  revolution in greater detail 
 This collection of essays contains all of Danto's now out-of-print Analytical Philosophy of History, plus a handful of other pieces.  If you are interested in the methods and objectives of historical study, or in the kind of knowledge history may produce, you should read this book 
 this radar/laser detector is very good detects the police radar and the best is do not  false signals 
 If you've never foraged before this is a great book to start with.  I thought the layout of this book was wonderful.  By putting the plants in order of season they are "ready" gets the forager more in tune to the rhtymns of the plants.  Also, he includes details on which ecosystems contain which plants.  And unlike other ID books, this one is readable.  I enjoyed reading about the plants in a narrative form instead of lists of uses, places where found etc..  The drawings are wonderful, but anyone considering foraging should always have a cross reference.  This will give you a good excuse to by an ID book with color pictures 
 It's really the best of show.  I prefer it over the other 2 SANTANA albums somewhat similar to this, Love Devotion Surrender and Illuminations.  There's a purity and calm in this one that's difficult to find on any other album, even a SANTANA one.  Somehow this album captures something that is beyond the usual Mexican/San Francisco/rock/Mexican music flavored music that SANTANA is famous for.  Instead it is more a musical spiritual journey yet completely on the money, not, as I mentioned, sorta odd like the other two somewhat similar SANTANA albums.    This is more of a jazz/spiritual music/easy on the Eastern music/gentle SANTANA thing that totally works.  chrisbct@hotmail.co 
 This was a very good book. I read it in one 2 hour space one afternoon. I just couldnt put it down, but somebody said that the others in the I Was a Sixth Grade Alien series are better, so I want to try them out too. I would highly recommend this book, and hope that you will enjoy it 
 I purchased this book and it is the best ever. I tried books recommended by others and those books were thrash, this is a great book and you'll love it 
 The value of this book is not for its groundbreaking concepts (as no individual concept is overly insightful) as many reviewers have implied, but rather for the framework it provides.  Almost all of Porter's main points are patently obvious to a modestly educated reader (e.g., a firm can compete on either charging a lower price or if it doesn't charge a lower price, it must make a differentiated/better product).  Most points made in this book do not go much deeper than that, and any given reader would intuitively know any isolated strategy that Porter lays out without reading his book.  However, the book is great not in that it will change your thoughts/intuitions, but in that it will give you a well-structured overall framework for analyzing competitive strategy holistically.  In other words, it combines fairly obvious conclusions/intuitions into one overarching strategic overview.  Most readers have noted the value that business managers can obtain by studying the text, but I can also see a lot of value that investors analyzing industries, or an individual company's position in an industry can get out of the book 
 A throughly delightful and informative book...  A MUST read for all women and their men as well... especially if you wish to revatilize your sex life.  For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by stories of the sensual and beautiful Geisha.  It seemed they always appeared amost etherial in nature and yet their legendary ability to bewitch men with their mystery, sensuality and beautifully delicate demeanor was world renound.  In this book, Py shares many of the ultra feminine, female secrets from the traditions of the Geisha that had apparently been lost or hidden from the Western World for many years.  Her style of writing is gently, yet factual, as she shares ideas and techniques she learned through her own journey to happiness and love with the rest of us in a motherly/sisterly way.  (In fact she reminded me of how I often tell my children about my own misconceptions, mistakes and/or successes in life in an effort that they may be able to gleen knowledge or insite from them.)  I greatly appreciate Py sharing so many wonderful ideas and techniques with us all.  I admit that I learned much useful information from following her along her journey. I can't wait to begin with my new approach in MY journey towards happiness, love, and self satisfaction 
 I benefitted enormously from this book.  I was amazed at the venom unleashed [by only a few reviewers] on this informative and helpful book, which makes no claims to be based on scientific studies but on anecdotal evidence that fell into the writer's lap because he had to struggle through the anxiety of observing and, yes, testing his own late-talking child.  It is not a how-to-book, nor does it attempt to give parents diagnostic tools. The anecdotal approach is helpful because it does not present just the situation of one child, but the predicament of many who fall outside the parameters of the lists that now proliferate in the health care community which pretend to establish rigid parameters of normal development, despite disclaimers to the contrary.    Late Talking Children does not pretend to be a panacea but to offer useful insight into the phenomena to parents who may well become involved with a health care system which is not always parent-, child-, or family-friendly.  Kudos to Dr. Sowell.   
 What struck me most about these stories, in addition to the sensitive and thoughtful translation and the wonderful Tevye character, is that they don't really depict the long-lost, static, traditional culture of the Eastern European shtetl (Jewish village). By the time Sholem Aleichem wrote these stories, the life of the shtetl was disintegrating. It was a transitional time, when emigration to America, the influence of Western culture, the pull of socialism and other radical movements, and many other forces were already acting upon traditional Judaism. Tevye, whose knowledge of Jewish sources is picturesque but not very deep, was one of the most knowledgeable people in his town. That pretty much says it all.  The Tevye stories are unforgettable, the "railroad" stories of more mixed quality. That is why I only gave the book four stars. Still, highly recommended 
 This book is the real deal.  Stevenson looks for and reports his work  regarding the history of Fremasonry.  Very scholarly and very interesting.   I would like to spend time with this author as this book is very thought  provoking.  I agree with Stevenson, his work has made me appriciate Masonry  all the more.  Well done 
 As the CD title would suggest that smooth jazz stalwart Gerald Albright has indeed moved to a new lable, moreover, it would appear that this move has not damppened his enthauism, as this particular CD moves from strength to strength. Although some would argue that the vocals detract from the instrumentals, which would appear to be a rather persistent argument amongst listeners of jazz; however, I suspect that Mr. Albright and his producers have in this project found the balance between the two such that the entire collection is appealing and worthy of anyone's smooth jazz collection.  
 This is a mostly entertaining and enlightening study from Reid, a foreign correspondent who has lived in Japan and traveled throughout Asia. Reid's concern is not the economic success of East Asia, but what he calls the "social miracle." This would be the great civility, politeness, high educational standards, low crime, and all-around successful social stability of Eastern Asian nations. Reid cites the deep cultural influences of Confucianism as the key to this success. Examples are the Confucian ideals of community, shame, and encouragement, which all contrast directly with the Western ideals of individuality, guilt, and punishment. Reid delivers these revelations in a very enlightening fashion and his writing is quite enjoyable, especially when talking about his Tokyo neighbor, the immensely polite and courteous Matsuda-san.  However, Reid also learns that the most basic Confucian tenets of hard work and virtue are also core Western tenets, and that the West would be greatly improved by a return to those values. The main problem here is Reid's quite superficial interpretations of both Eastern and Western societies - he often talks like a sociologist but clearly isn't. In Japan especially, Reid probably saw mostly the politeness that the natives save for visitors, with little or no direct experience of real social problems. The book ends with very flimsy solutions, mostly concerning abstract concepts like morality, for the West to integrate Eastern concepts to everyone's social benefit. So beware of these superficialities in this otherwise enjoyable study of cultures that are both vastly different, but more alike than you might think 
 Excellent book and it really works. I would recommend it to everybody 
 For the kids who loved the original movie, this series is great!  Mom checked, kid approved 
 An amazing album consisting of Sir Rotten and co's early rawness and the anarchy filled Sid Viscious era. If you already have 'Never Mind The Bollocks', there is no harm in spending a few quid (or bucks) on this punk rock masterpiece. This neighbour annoying musical specimin will only leave your CD player when your Granny comes round. Remove any sharp objects from your room, reach for the safety pins Dorothy, cos hey punk!                     IT'S POGO TIME!! 
 Excellent book for young readers.  My son is eight. He was   delighted with all aspect of Walter: The Story of a Rat.  The reading level is a step up from early chapter books; ie. Magic Tree House, Magic School Bus. Vocabulary and plot are challenging and intriging. Well worth the read 
 Closure. Coleman Silk tells his class, there is never closure. But Coleman is not a novelist and Philip Roth is. Philip Roth is a very clever novelist. Some would say diabolically clever. If you have a doubt on this score, read the last line at the bottom of this page and then re-read the book.   Before you do that, you need to know  that this book contains little of Roth's usual   preoccupation with his own Jewishness---How does Sol Bellow do this without being so self-indulgent? --- What is different here is that Roth resorts to a cute literary gimmick.  It's a lot like the one used in the movie The Sixth Sense. You almost have to see, or in this case, read, the book twice to understand what the author has pulled off.  Unless you discover the gimmick, you are unlikely to get it; get the point; get closure.  There are lots of hints if you know where to look. There are all those lies. Different types of lies. Good lies and bad lies. Coleman lies to recreate himself into a new Gatsby type upwardly mobile "immigrant" in a post WWII society. Bill Clinton lies about his relationship with Monica. Faunia lies so that she can remain in her protective shell. The spooks lie when they call Coleman a racist. Delphine lies to herself about her feelings for Coleman. The government lies to us about casualties in Viet Nam.  Les lies about his rehabilitation. And, Zuckerman lies to the reader when he places Les at the scene of the fatal crash.  
    Woodrell is like no other author. Absolutly compelling. I believe I have read them all. If I have missed one, I will order it asap 
 As a kid, I loved this book.  As a young adult, I've gone to college and become a Classics major. Now I'm reading the Aeneid in Latin, and I've really begun to appreciate what a wonderful book this is!  I have no way of judging this book's suitability for "kids in general." For me, though, this book instilled a love of mythology and history that has stayed with me through my life so far. I strongly suggest it 
 I just found out about this book as an adult, read it and loved it.  I wish I had heard about it as a preteen or teenager -- it was exactly the type of book I read as a child.  While it does have magical elements, it is not full of "Harry Potter" magic if people are lead here by JK Rowling's comments.  It is more fanciful and mysterious, with a little bit of chaste romance thrown in -- a perfect escape from the real world for a bit.  It sounds like a movie is being made, which intrigues me.  I can't wait to see how it translates to the big screen.  Altogether, it was an absolutely lovely book, one I am going to recommend to others to read -- 'tween, teen, or adult 
 I have been travelling on business to India (and to China) regularly since about 1992, but I have never lived there.  The books confirms and explains many of the charming and of the not so charming characteristics of India and of the people there.  For example, the excessive need to be right all the time ("God knows everything, an Indian knows more"), which I attributed to some inferiority complex seems to lay much deeper.  The book further explains parts of contemporary Indian politics and society which I never understood and often did not even see, being a frequent visitor, but for a week at a time only.  It is a very amusing and at the same time enlightening book for anybody interested in contemporary India. 
 I like to listen while I drive and it is very helpfu 
 The first seven books of A Series of Unfortunate Events followed the same formula. The Baudelaire Orphans are with the banker Mr. Poe until he can find a new relative willing to care for the siblings. Things go badly and the evil Count Olaf shows up with another nefarious plan to kidnap the children and somehow steal their inheritance. In the end they get away and Olaf is on the run from the authorities. The ending of The Vile Village changes this. The Baudelaires are on the run, suspected of the murder of Count Olaf despite the fact that he isn't dead and that there is no way they could have committed the non-existent crime. The Hostile Hospital opens with the orphans trying to find a place where they can learn about VFD, the Quagmire triplets, and some clue that will help keep them safe and stop Count Olaf from coming after them ever again. This time there is no Mr. Poe and no new distant relative to live with. Count Olaf is in much less of this book than we have come to expect, though he and his cronies play major roles in instigating the action.  Author Lemony Snicket (an assumed name as the author is as much a character in the story as the Baudelaires are) does an excellent job in presenting the story of the Baudelaires experiences at a hospital trying to research in the records room what the truth behind the events of the past several novels and once more running afoul of the minions of Count Olaf and being placed into mortal danger once again. Snicket sets up the next volume very well and tells the story in such a way that the novel flows into the next book while telling an independent story at the same time. The breaking of the formula of the series is a refreshing change and spices up the action quite a bit. The Hostile Hospital is one of the best of the first eight volumes in this series.  -Joe Sherr 
 Barbara Brown Taylor has beautifully written an autobiography of her walk into and out of the Episcopal priesthood. She writes of her eventual burn-out in the day-to-day needs of parish work, and her search for God in and out of the priesthood.  She eventually leaves the active priestly role in favour of teaching in a nearby college.  I admire her intense committment to her spiritual walk, but at the end, I felt that she had somehow missed Jesus in the depth of her life. She wonders if He is found in a spiritual experience in an Indian sweat lodge, or on a Lakota vision quest. "...Cleto took Ed to the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where a Lakota Sun Dance chief named Elmer Running took everything away from Ed but one wool blanket and sat him out on a hill to pray for two days without food or water. When I met Ed at the Atlanta airport, I had a hard time recognizing him. He had shaved his beard for one thing. His eyes were like small suns in the middle of his s un burned face...  On the way home he said many things, but the one that stuck with me was, 'You make church too easy.'... Ed was deeply involved in Lakota ways. Since these are the ways of prayer, he was able to remain Episcopal as well, or perhaps I should say  that he was only able to remain Episcopal because of these ways, which offered him concrete means of practising his faith that teaching Sunday school and singing in the choir did not."  Well, I agree with Ed, that we certainly do make church too easy. But love of the liturgical  experience does not remove the onus on each Christian to individually find Jesus within the parameters that Jesus Himself has set for us. Ms. Taylor's faith over time becomes polluted with New Age thinking, which she doesn't seem to recognise for what it is: a moving away from the absolutes of the Christian faith: Jesus said, "I am the way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except by Me."  I loved the book for it's honesty, it's exploration of a committed Christian's walk, and the beautiful quality of the writing. I would recommend it without reservation. J. Durkin, Colorado Spring 
 YAAAAASSSS! YAAAAASSSS! YAAAAAASSSS! I can't believe I've been missing out on this stuff, It's absolutely wild! Bob Dylan was going through something in 1976, I'm not sure what, but it turned into DYNAMITE on stage.  Now, now, I ain't gonna say forget everything else, but, maybe put it aside for a little bit and put these two discs on somewhere where its ok to make the music VERY LOUD! Headphones, your car, your neighbors house when they aren't home, I don't care... just let it PUMP! Bob Dylan is a MADMAN here, but he sounds so FRESH! These are mostly songs that you've heard a milllion times before, but NEVER like this. Almost every song is a different vision of his classic material, loud, gritty, kick you in the teeth kind of stuff! Go ahead and pick a track, pick the first track TONIGHT I'LL BE STAYING HERE WITH YOU, now compare it somehow to the original version. I don't know man, I'm leaning towards ROLLING THUNDER!  WHEW! I need to cool down. GOD DAMN BOBBY, how come I didn't buy this three years ago? ITS KILLER! What else do you have hidden in those vaults?  Always expect the unexpected when it comes to the MAN. Not ALL of his live discs are winners, but this one definatley is. If you've been putting this one off, you've been waiting too long 
 I had never attended a Jimmy Buffet concert before...and didn't think I would be particularly interested to do so.  But because of a business request, there I was at Wrigley for the Monday concert only 10 or 12 rows back from the stage and had no idea what to expect.  I was familiar with only a handful of Buffet tunes over the years, but little did I know what was in store for the afternoon.  All I can say is I was instantly transformed into a Parrothead!  What a fun experience to be there with thousands of happy people dressed in all manner of tropical attire singing every word to every song.  Some people dismiss Buffet's songs as "escapism", and some certainly are.  But other songs make you think.  Disc One captures the sound and feel of that afternoon at Wrigley.  Several songs he did that day are not on this DVD, but that's okay.  Just being at Wrigley for that historic event was cool, and this DVD allows me to relive it again and again.  
 While this is the 6th book in Carl's Chocoholic series, it was my first. I enjoyed my "visit" to the Michigan resort town so much that I purchased the first 5 books in the series so that I can start at the beginning. That said, The Chocolate Bridal Bash was a perfectly good stand-alone mystery in its own right. I agree with some of the other reader comments that the malapropism conceit for the main character gets tedious, but even that doesn't eclipse the enjoyment factor of this series 
 unless Mr. Walsh prefers 'musicologist' to 'biographer'. When I finished volume II, I immediately went and bought volume I. I rated the book 5 stars but wish I could give it 6. As a retired music librarian, I am cautious in following the hype about any new book on music/musicians/musicology that is making the rounds and more often than not, while the reviews may be accurate, regrettably, there are times they're not accurate enough. I think Mr. Walsh's two volumes are stunning. I think they are so good that once started, one wants to do nothing but sit and read them. The period and the musical life out of which Stravinsky emerged is not unknown to me and I think the deepest connection I developed with Stravinsky's music was when I played in a performance of Symphony of Psalms. Whether or not I walked away humming portions of it (which is unlikely since I cannot sing), the music has left, to use a trite phrase, an indelible mark on both my musical and cultural psyche, but so has the personality of Stravinsky himself. And Mr. Walsh does an incredibly job of making him breathe. It isn't just Stravinsky who breathes in the course of reading this book (I haven't finished Volume I) but the words and the events and the people take on a life that is far more than facts as accurate as they might be. I cannot recommend these two volumes highly enough and I only wish it was possible for Mr. Walsh to write a third 
 This is one of the greatest rap albums to come out of California in the mid 90's. I like 4 tha Scrilla, the Bullet, Red Rum, Killa Kali, and Funk Season. This album makes Dr Dre's "the Chronic" and Tupac's "All Eyez on Me" sound like crap 
 4 stars for a standard Michael Crichton yarn.  Well-researched, well-paced, characters typically unidimensional but reasonably well-drawn.  "Read" this on CDs on the daily commute.  (On a side note, should you decide to listen to the recorded version of this book, beware: the reader does an able job with the narrative portions, and manages, more or less, to convey a modest range of adult voices.  His kids voices, however, are excruciating.  One wonders at the high praise he has (reputedly) garnered in the course of a long career in theater.  Struck me as a run-of-the-mill/mediocre reader.  In fairness, of course, Crichton didn't give him much in the way of compelling, realistic, or nuanced dialogue).  LW is a fun romp.  A book for the plane or the daily commute.  Sit back and enjoy 
 The cd doesn't cotain " Hiding under water" and " Lay your hands on me 
 As a newcomer to the Visual Basic Programming language and just plain new to Programming period. I picked this book up after I had started an Accelerated Visual Basic Class at my Community College.  I was falling behind fast and was getting rather flustered. This book helped me so much. It begins by getting you used to the IDE you are working in. Something I was very surprised my instructor wasn't doing. After I was comfortable, I found that doing the things my instructor was talking about and the things the book asked you to do were second nature.  The book is designed in a modular fashion. So skipping over subjects we were not talking about in class was easy and allowed me to keep pace without being bogged down in advanced terms I had not learned yet. Chapters 10 and 11 were my greatest asset. Mr. Sempf did an excellent job of getting you to think like you needed in order to understand. I found this book a great asset overall. And was a delight to read unlike some Technical Books I have read. Thanks Mr. Sempf for the care you put into making this book enjoyable.  
 How can we explain a 2,000-year history of a church that calls Jesus the Lord, but does not follow him in his teaching and example of absolute nonviolence?  John Howard Yoder invested his lifetime in answering that question--his best-known single work is The Politics of Jesus (1973).  In The Priestly Kingdom, Yoder's essays address the 1,700-year-old heresy of obeying Caesar rather than Jesus when Caesar calls Christians to war.  Although out-of-print, the essays on Constantinianism and Civil Religion are must reading for those who want to develop a consistent ethic of Christian nonviolent discipleship 
 After completing my reading of the Faithful River by Zeromski I am reminded of "The English Patient", the movie starring Ralph Fiennes from several years back. Zeromski does a magnificant job of setting  the ambience for this work and the reader is transported into the mind of  the Soldier as he struggles to live. This book is exremely well transalated  by Bill Johnston and is a pleasure for any one to read 
 Godsmack sold millions of copies of their debut album and became big names in the rock industry. Now, can they defeat what some rock groups have encountered: the sophomore slump, even jinx? Well, to some degree, AWAKE has many moments to enjoy, but it's virtually Godsmack doing what's best for them: rocking hard and enjoying every minute.  "Sick of Life" seems a tad jaded, but it's also very aggressive and piles into the driving and chunky title track, which has some power over its predecessor. "Vampires" is the most atmospheric track, with movie bits thrown in for good measure to add to the melancholy of the track. "Bad Magick" and "Greed" both feature assaulting guitars and crushing rhythms, and Sully's vocals are still fully intact. The lyrics on this album are not as strong as on the self-titled or on FACELESS, but "Goin' Down", despite the minimal lyrical content, still rocks very much. Perhaps one of the best tracks is the six minute atmospheric rock of "Mistakes". Here Sully contemplates that he's "made too many mistakes" and his conviction matches the music. The short "The Journey" flows right into the closing finale "The Spiral", which leaves the door open as to where Godsmack will go next.  Consequently, this would be the last Godsmack album to feature Tommy Stewart on drums, but Godsmack would show no signs of letting up despite that loss. Despite some of the repetitive moments on the album, AWAKE still is a solid affair 
 THIS IS A GREAT KID'S BOOK.  THE ILLUSTRATIONS, CHARACTERS, CONTENT ARE INTERESTING FOR KIDS AND THEY CAN ENJOY IT EVEN BEFORE THEY ARE OF READING AGE.  ONE DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT IT'S ABRIDGED - WHY NOT BRING BACK THE FULL-SIZED BOOK?  
 This is essentially a comic book, yet it is able to communicate the fundamental laws of physics taught in an introductory high school physics course and some taught in college such as relativity.  Overall, the book is enjoyable and humorous.  However, the constraints of actually teaching the material through the drawings do impose on the humor sometimes.  The book is accurate, as far as I can tell, and allows one to gain some understanding on how things work, from how the tides come about, to the motion of a gyroscope, to the Theory of Relativity.  One disclaimer that I must add, that should be obvious, is that unless you are sufficient in mathematics (genius) you will not know all the consequences that come out from these laws other than the ones provided to you.  I would have to recommend this for people over 12 years old, those who want to learn a little physics in a fun and entertaining way.  
 I was more interested in the three older films: Cleopatra, Four Frightened People, and Sign of the Cross, since they were produced before the censor's code stymied DeMille.  These early talkies offered quite an eyeful and earful!  The other two were good period pieces; less theatrical and pretentious than some of DeMille's later films. Technical quality great considering the age of the movies 
 Nate is one of the best kid detectives I have ever met. The books are instant classics and I was inspired and interested in reading the whole series since third grade. I will buy the whole collection no matter what, just to have this smart gumshoe in my book case for my own pleasure to read again and again. 
 The possibilities of needlework in many forms are beautifully illustrated in this book.  It inspires and fires the imagination, and made me want to travel to England to take classes at this wonderful institution 
 I was 11 years old when "Battlestar Galactica" hit the scene.  "Star Wars" had just hit the scene the previous year, and since this was in the days before multiplexes, it was still showing in theaters.  Think about it... a TV show, promising "Star Wars"-like action EVERY WEEK?!?  FOR FREE?!?!?  Oh man, life was good.  The original BSG is late-70s TV at its best.  I won't go into the specifics of the show (that's what Wikipedia is for!), but I would like to say that the concept of Galactica was more ambitious than the culture paradigms of network TV allowed for.  So you end up with something that's a cross between "Star Wars" and "The Love Boat" in a stylistic sense.  Watching it now, almost 30 years later, it seems a bit goofy on the surface, but you can see what they were trying to do.  Anyone who is a fan of the mind-bogglingly awesome update of the show on the Sci-Fi Channel owes it to themselves to watch this show and see where it all began.  It will give you that much more of an appreciation for the new show.  You will see what elements they kept, what they modified, and what they dumped.  You'll see how they've taken certain plot points from the original that seemed insignificant and expanded upon them to create some of the best drama on TV today.  It's almost like saying "Romeo and Juliet" was based on "West Side Story," not the other way around.  As far as the packaging goes, I picked this up new from Amazon for $10 cheaper than the NON-cylon head packaging.  It seemed like a no-brainer.  For the people who complain about the box being difficult to store next to their other DVDs... come on.  You don't by something as insanely cool as the Cylon head packaging (with red lenticular EYE!!) and STORE it!  This is for DISPLAY purposes, man!  This is to have on your shelves when your geeky friends come over so they can drool over it and say "Duuuuuude!" and you can say "PWND!!"  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, then go buy the regular box... those who understand?  You know what to do 
 Ordinarily I would never have picked up a book to read that I knew was unfinished. However, I happened to see Andrew Davies' magnificent film version of WIVES AND DAUGHTERS recently and loved it so much that I went right out, bought the book and devoured it in just a couple of days. It is superb!!  Set in England in the early 1800's, the story centers around the life of Molly Gibson, a quiet, steady and sensible young woman who lives with her widowed physician father in the town of Hollingford. The two share a close bond until Mr. Gibson decides to remarry. While his new wife, Hyacinth, is not exactly a wicked stepmother, her attitude and parental abilities leave a lot to be desired. She brings along to the marriage her own teenage daughter, Cynthia, a beautiful and vivacious young woman with whom Molly immediately becomes best friends. The story follows along the everyday lives of the Gibsons as well as the local Hollingford townspeople, focusing especially on the efforts of Mrs. Gibson to marry her daughters off to eligible men. Two young gentlemen in particular figure high in this regard, Osbourne and Roger Hamley, the two sons of a local squire.   This book was serialized ( as were many books of the same era) in a popular magazine of the time and while the novel is unfinished it only lacks the final chapter. By then, it is very obvious to the reader what the outcome will be and that knowledge is strengthened by a final word provided at the end from Mrs. Gaskell's editor. He was in touch with the author right up until the event of her untimely death and he knew what she had planned for the final installment of the book. He lays those facts out for the reader so you really do get the full story, even though Mrs. Gaskell did not have the opportunity to write out the very ending in her own words.  If you're looking for a big thick wonderful saga to lose yourself in for a few days don't hesitate to pick up WIVES AND DAUGHTERS. Mrs. Gaskell does not enjoy the same notoriety as other more famous women authors such as Jane Austen or the Bronte sisters but she certainly deserves it. This story is beautifully written and an absolute joy to read! Highly recommended 
 I am still digesting "Ulysses." I read it while walking around Dublin a few years ago. It was marvelous to trace the steps of Leopold and Molly, and to see what they "saw," but the novel remains a distant pleasure to the reader. I must admit it is not the most accessible book ever written, but it gets four stars for its intent ... and that it is better than "Finnegan's Wake." Be warned: This novel is not for the casual reader. This is one of several excellent accompaniments to "Ulysses" and well worth the price and the time to compare against Joyce 
 Shy Victor's parents arrange a marriage for him, thinking that he will never marry on his own.  His parents are newly rich, so they immediately want to pair him up with someone from old money.  They arrange the marriage to Victoria, a young woman who's just as quiet and retiring as Victor.  But somehow, in the space of a few minutes, true love ignites between the two.  As soon as it does, however, the fates conspire to keep them apart.  First Victor can't remember his vows.  Then the priest sends him away, saying that Victor doesn't want to marry.  Then, when Victor finally practices his vows (thinking he's by himself) and gets them right, he ends up married to a young dead woman who was murdered for her dowry years ago.  Tim Burton directed the film starring Johnny Depp.  The two have worked together before on several projects, including EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW, and other.  Both are known for working with the bizarre and stylized worlds/characters.  CORPSE BRIDE is a simple tale, actually, and that really shines through.  If Burton and the writers didn't take this from a fable or myth, I'd be surprised.  It's just too natural.  The stop-motion animation is beautiful, and the two worlds (of the living and of the dead) are well thought-out and visually striking.  Everything ties in neatly at the end.  I watched it on HD DVD and found the production to be outstanding.  The sound wasn't Lossless, but it was really good and did well on my surround sound system.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans will want to pick up CORPSE BRIDE.  Anyone wanting something unusual that you won't see every day would be interested in picking this one up for rent for movie night.  You'll find something (story, animation, or characters) that will spark your imagination 
 The content of the book deserves all the accolades that other reviewers have heaped upon it, so I won't repeat what has already been said.  Garret Oliver's passion for beer and food is evident from the first paragraph. The prose is at once zealous, lighthearted, and entertaining, and his enthusiasm is infectious. Once opening the book, one can't help but consider what beer to accompany the next meal or snack, to the point of planning menus for the whole week. A delightful  must-read for anyone looking to improve their culinary life; also an invaluable resource to any restauranteur, chef, sommelier, caterer, gourmet food or beer retailer 
 I am a big Audioslave fan.  I felt the first CD was fantastic. The second CD was a lesser product, but still holds up on it's own. But for "Revelations", these guys appear to be hitting their stride as a musical foursome.  This CD is superb!  In my opinion, the only mediocre track is "Until We Fall".  Every other song is as good as anything Audioslave has ever done.  There are several tracks (Revelations, Sound Of A Gun & Jewel Of The Summertime) that are among the best Rock songs I've ever heard.  Tremendous CD.  This is one of the best CDs I own, and I own more than 400 of them.  I've had this CD since it was released, and I'm still listening to it to this day.  It never gets old.  If I were able to give it a ranking out of 100 stars I would give it 99 of 100.  Seriously! 
 Zits captures the essence of all teenagers in this book! Its so funny...and so true! Its perfect for all teenagers 
 This book describes step-by-step how to cut men's hair.  This book was written by a barber and he does a great job explaining the haircutting process.  I would not buy this book if you want to cut women's hair.  I cut my husband's hair now and he is forever grateful!  The print is in black and white and the pictures of the models are outdated.  Otherwise, an excellent how-to book.  Note to publisher/auther:  Update this book, please 
 Wonderful read for the whole family.  This is a book we look forward to reading to our little one, over and over.  The art work is fantastic, the words are entertaining and has a section at the end of the book to educate about all the cycles of water.  Do not hesitate to add this to your library 
 The reader from San Diego is clearly unaware that much of thework is from the 50s and that almost Everyone [copied] from Bidgood. Hiswork is a milestone in the representation of visual, fantastical and sensual love.  EN 
  AS WW2 goes on around a crumbled Warsaw, the children with the names Ruth, Edek and Bronia much hike to Switzerland to reunite their broken family.  AS they go on, they expirience great changes within. The stress they udergo also seems to afect those who read it.  It captures you imagination and gives a few illustrations so you know what the scenery is. Escape from Warsaw also demonstrates a great bond between a family and it is useful to carry a few Kleenex.  I recomend this for all who can read.  The action, despair and cunning escapes kept my fingers glued to the book.  Overall it's something that hurts everytime you put it down for the night 
          Bo Knows Bo is a good book.  It's about Bo Jackson's life as a kid, and how he played professional baseball and football.   It tells you about his childhood, and when he went to Auburn. It talks about his personal life, when he played baseball, and football, too. It has chapters when people like Howie Long write in the book.           I would recommend this book to sport fans or people how know Bo Jackson and want to know more about the real Bo Jackson's life.            Spokane,WA Morch 17,2005  9 o'clock 32 minuts 21 secents 
 As you can check the 4Ps and the 14 management principles typed by some reviewers here, most of them are just common sense. However, common sense is really not that common, at least not in the auto industry when one sees the high failure rate, even amongst Japanese auto makers who copy some but not all of the Toyota Way or Toyota Production System TPS. Thanks to the author, many good samples are vividly written of how Toyota fully commits to its long term principles at the expense of short term benefits, respects the communities where its factories locate, supports even the lowest of worker to quality/value devotion (Dare you stop the whole production line for a minor fault you find? They encourage you to do so in Toyota). I am sure many ordinary but top level managers will excuse themselves from the level of Toyota committment on unique circumstances. In Toyota, they ask themselves "why" five times on each problem to nail its root cause, instead of taking anything for granted, as those ordinary managers do. Moreover, Toyota had invested/devoted much to adapt to the cultural, social....difference between Japan and US. Add them all up, that's the difference between survival and death.   I had read many business books of the HBR type. However, if I am asked to make only one recommendation, this is it. 
 A few weeks ago I looked at Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), and I was pleasantly surprised with what a good movie it was. So how could I resist picking up 2000's loosely tied in follow-on Snatch (aka Lock, Stock and Six Stolen Diamonds)?   In Snatch, several of the actors are back from "Lock, Stock", but all playing unrelated characters along side Brad Pitt. The first few minutes of Snatch looked like it was going to be a cash-in imitation of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but Snatch quickly developed its own story and characters.  Both "Lock, Stock" and Snatch are stylistically similar presentation-wise in a Pulp Fiction (1994) kind of way: Characters involved with various criminal activity are unaware of each other's presence throughout most of the movie, but then they are ultimately all connected by the closing credits.  There is a lot of violence seasoned with a good amount of black comedy. The acting is great. Ritchie is a master at getting a realistic reaction out of his cast...not just to situations and shocking acts of violence, but to people. The way the cast reacts to Brad Pitt's character is as believable as it is priceless.  Brad Pitt does a great job in this movie. I've seen a lot of criticism about Pitt's acting abilities, but I've got to say that I am mostly impressed with the roles that I've seen him in. And his character in Snatch, due to how well he played it, will stand out in my mind for a long time.  Jason Statham is as good as ever too. Like Samuel L. Jackson, Statham always seems to be the same guy in all of the movies he's in...same persona. And it just works every time.  Looking for a blast from the past with good actors, good action and a good story? Look no further. Here it is. Snatch may not be a collector's item, but it's worth the price.  And check out Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels too if you've not done so already.   
 This is a beautiful book.  I have read it more times than I can remember.  I just recently ordered yet another copy to give to a friend of mine.  This book will make you reconsider a lot of your previously held assumptions, and help you to evaluate your spiritual walk.  I highly recommend anything by Schaeffer.  This book especially 
 George Eliot, a.k.a. Mary-Anne Evans, was a popular novelist in her time, which has immediately made her books classic reads in schools, libraries, or even a novelist looking for inspiration to write a novel that shall be a classic in the future. Evans crafted a beautiful plot, and captivates the readers once the background chapters have been set up, and the action begins. It is rare that such a book in our day and age exists, and it is nice to read the popular things that were back in that day and age. I, being in high school, had the option of reading this book or Evans' other brilliant novel, "Middlemarch". I thought this might be an excellent read, so I chose this.  At first, I thought I had made the wrong choice and thought of switching to "Middlemarch" before it was too late. It starts out slow if you are reading Eliot for the first time, but the mind is only preparing itself to the odd language of the period (thank goodness it isn't Old English). However, once the background of Lantern Yard and Raveloe have been given to us, along with Silas Marner's history, we dive straight into the plot -- Godfrey and Dunstan Cass, Nancy Lammeter, The Red House, The Rainbow, Silas, Eppie, Molly, Priscilla, Squire Cass, Dolly Winthrop, Aaron -- all characters and places which set us into the story. With the dialogue and tension perfectly set, it is no wonder why this has become a classic.  Perfect for a classroom, Silas Marner promises each person who reads it a lesson in what really matters to the heart -- in Silas' position, I would have chosen the golden locks too 
 Canseco's book moves along at a good pace and kept my interest throughout.  I took much of what he said to be fairly shallow rationalizations for his steroid use, but somehow that seemed okay coming from a major league ballplayer with his image and reputation.  Canseco gets away with it precisely because of his bad-boy image, and that is ironic, since he complains in his book about the white "golden boys" in baseball who can say or do anything and get away with it 
 I did a lot of online and store researching before I bought this seat for my 3 1/2 year old son. My one concern was that my son is very slim and all the reviews talked about how the seat worked well for larger children. Well now I can say it works well for slim ones as well. He loves the arm rests and the cup holder. It is light weight and so easy to move and fold when necessary. We liked it so much we are going to buy  another one for when our 2 year son son is ready for that transition 
 The staircase was an excellent book. I was reading this for a children's literature class and I am glad I picked this book.  I love the character of Lizzy.  She goes through so much in this book and you can't help but be on her side when Elinora tries to get her in trouble.  Lizzy does not care how others thing of her she just wants to get out of the all girls' school.  This is an excellent book for children to read.  The plot was very interesting and exciting.  The characters are likeable and true to life, Rinaldi's writing is very descriptive.  This story is about friendship, families, and lessons of life.  This book would be an excellent read aloud.  It introduces friendships and how to learn to be on your own 
 I have been working on the proposal for my latest non-fiction book for some time.  Even though I have sold three previous business books without an agent, I feel like the topic of this book requires a top agent if the book is to sell to one of the leading New York publishers and receive the attention it requires from them.  I reread my old stand-bys among books that have helped me in the past to write successful book proposals.  I realized that those books are more aimed at the average non-fiction book rather than one that has the potential for a wide audience.  On my fourth trip to find a book to help me with this proposal, I found the 3rd edition of How to Write a Book Proposal by Michael Larsen.  That was a momentous day for me as a writer!  This book made it clear how to make the case for a major publisher to take on a non-fiction book and give that book full support.  In addition, the book assumes that the reader is capable of producing such a proposal and book.  What a breath of fresh air that was!  I found myself both informed and motivated to create a wonderful proposal.    In the process, I learned some excellent tips for writing query letters to agents, preparing mini-proposals and packaging the final proposal.  Although I am experienced in this area, I found Mr. Larsen's many detailed descriptions and examples of what is needed to be very helpful and stimulating.  I also recommend that you visit Mr. Larsen's Web site for his literary agency where he provides excellent information for how to work with him as an agent.    Even if you think you have a book with limited commercial potential, you would do well to read and apply this book.  You may be able to switch your focus to create a book with much more potential as a result.    Good luck with your next proposal!   
 Dr. Brose's book is an amazing tool for mastering the EKG.  I have personally used this text each and every day on rounds and seeing patients in clinic.  It is easy to read and contains what every student/intern/resident needs to know.  I implore all of you out there that haven't conquered the EKG, to purchase this book and learn how to become a master at interpretation 
 While tempted to add some moralizing of his own, Harry Stout leaves final judgement up to the reader. When I first browsed this book, what struck me was the sheer volume of "moral history" that the Civil War generated for future generations to sort out. I had never seen all of the issues compiled in one volume before. Although religion is naturally a recurring theme throughout, it pales in comparison to the issue of race. And the author does a great job describing how neither side could easily claim the moral high ground on racial matters. From the Emancipation Proclamation, to the recruiting of black units, to the assignments of those units in the field, to the ultimate morality or leaving black troops out of prisoner exchanges, and the final exclusion of black units in the grand review at the conclusion of the war. Lincoln's genius is in large measure portrayed as the ultimate moral arbiter who could balance racial issues with affairs of war and politics. The role of religion and the religious press is explored in detail in the book. One thing I never realized before is that the traditional Thanksgiving Holiday was created out of the Civil War religious observances (and was later coopted by New Englanders) The closest any book has come to exposing the ambiguous nature of moral claims by both sides 
 I read the book and then saw the movie. Which one did i like the best? i liked the book better because it seemed more real, and it was a more compleate story than the movie.The book is a little bit more detailed than the movie. i would suggest reading the book before you watch the movie. The movie is still a good movie just not as good as the book 
 WAY BACK IN 1972 WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD I WENT INTO MY LOCAL KMART AND SAW A RED ALBUM WITH A HUGE SNAKE ON THE FRONT. NEEDLESS TO SAY I PURCHASED IT.THE BACK COVER WAS JUST AS GRUESOME WITH FIVE UGLY HIPPIES ON IT. WHEN I OPENED MY PRIZE I SAW ALICE HANGING HIMSELF WITH A BONUS 1972 CALENDER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIC.LITTLE DID I KNOW THE MUSIC WOULD BE MORE "KILLER" THAN THE ALBUM COVER. I TURNED MY STROBE LIGHT AND BLACKLIGHT ON AND LOOKED AT MY BLACKLIGHT POSTER OF A GHOUL FLOATING OVER A GRAVEYARD AND STARTED THE LP. THERE WAS NO TURNING BACK I WAS HOOKED FROM THE FIRST STRAINS OF UNDER MY WHEELS.THE WHOLE ALBUM KICKS FROM START TO FINISH AND IM SURE 95 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE READING THIS HAVE HEARD THE SONGS A MILLION TIMES.WHAT I ALWAYS LIKED ABOUT ALICES EARLY ALBUMS WAS THAT THEY CAME WITH PRIZES. KILLER HAD A CALENDAR,SCHOOLS OUT HAD THE RECORD ALBUM WRAPPED IN PAPER PANTIES LOL BILLION DOLLAR BABIES HAD PUNCH OUT TRADING CARDS AND A HUGE BILLION DOLLAR FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE AND MUSCLE OF LOVE HAD A SMALL POSTER OF EM ALL PEELING POTATOES AFTER BEING BEAT UP BY A GORILLA! EVERY KID SHOULD HAVE KILLERS IN THEYRE COLLECTION LIKE I DID.I AM PLEASED THAT I FOUND THIS ALBUM ON MY OWN WITHOUT ANYONE TURNING ME ON TO IT.FIVE STARS FOR SURE.THANKS FOR READING.MARK "STOMP" CHOM 
 This was a great read for a first-time mom.  I read it in one sitting and laughed out loud and cried too.  Afterwards I was inspired to start my own Stay At Home Mom's email club which now has 6 members 
 This book is fun comical book for children who want to read something mysterious. This cute book gives the reader the enthusiasm in turning the pages to see what happens of the young boy going into a creepy house focusing on the search of his mother.

 I have read this magazine on and off for a several years and wanted to add my 2 cents.  Yes, the magazine does have many ads for business opportunities.  But this is exactly something I want to read and evaluate, the marketplace of business opportunities.  Many of these are franchise opportunities, which is exactly where the first time entrepreneur should start.  The articles are generally well written and many will obviously be useful, but not all.  The value of each article often depends on where you are in the business creation process.  It was not until I read the E-Myth Revisited that I understood the value of these franchises.  This magazine slices and dices the franchises by many metrics to help you find one where you are most likely to both succeed and be happy.  The magazine is easily worth more than the price to any person seriously starting or building a small enterprise.  Hope this has been helpful to the entrepreneurs out there 
 David Hackett Fisher's "Washington's Crossing" is a wonderfully written and research history of this seminal event in American history.  I was admittedly hesitant to read this work, Pulitzer Prize and all, as I felt the topic a bit narrow for my tastes and it perhaps a bit too much like a high school history lesson.  Luckily, I was very mistaken.    Perhaps the author put it best.  "There is an old American folk tale about George Washington and the Crossing of the Delaware.  It tells us that the new American republics nearly failed in the winter of 1776, that George Washington crossed the Delaware on Christmas night, and that his victory at Trenton revived the Revolution.  All of this story is true, but that in not the whole truth.  There was more to it."  The "more to it" is captured in the pages of the book and followed by footnotes and various appendices that accound for 168 pages, many of which are well worth reading within of themselves.  Fisher accomplished so much in this volume that the lavish praise many have written is richly deserved.  His ability to put into context a very rough 1776 with the Crossing and ensueing battles was simply superb.  Fischer and James McPherson are editors of this series, published  by the Oxford University Press, Pivotal Moments in American History.  James McPherson, a wonderfully accomplished historian and contribtor to another series by the same publisher, The Oxford History of the United States (with Battle Cry of Freedom)  will most assuredly oversee works of very high caliber.  I look forward to reading many more of them, with James T. Patterson at the top of my list with his contribution to this series on Brown v. the Board of Education.    Lastly I would add that my interest in history rarely includes an appetite for military history.  That said, Fischer does a great job in covering a largely military operation while keeping the interest of students of history who might not otherwise be inclined for the level of research and written detail.  
   I haven't had the chance yet to buy & read this book. I will. I have looked through it & in a world where women make $.71c on the dollar to men & ( common political theme as of late)& a world where men are becoming feminists in order to defy the biases that alienate them as a sex as well, this book explores, honestly, the exploitation of women & what can & must be done about it..To approach this ancient & prevalent epidemic is all the reason to be informed & read about it.. If one of us is enslaved, all of us are enslaved, by all the emotional & mental realities that any decent person struggles to confront in order to enchance theirs & others lives...All the while, working & fighting off & defying all the delusions, biases, prejudices, outdated & unreasonable laws & ageless allegories we are motivated & inspired to change. Whew....  Change is good. 
 I really enjoyed this book.  It has given me a great deal of information on the toxicity we have in our lives.  I plan to purchase a high quality juicer and start juice fasting every few months.  There is also some great and easy lifestyle changes that can be made to make a big impact 
 This movie is awesome!  Basically, it talks about a startup dot com and takes you through the company timeline from the day the name was chosen until they had to close the doors.  A lot of interesting things happened along the way like a break-in, and  . . .well, I dont want to spoil it for you.  If you are thinking about owning your own business, you MUST watch this movie 
 This is the best of the three Hemingway novels I've read, the other two being The Sun Also Rises and For Whom the Bell Tolls.  This is a novel of youth, best exhibited by the young nurse. It's also a novel of idealism--the ambulance driver committed to the war even as a non-combatant. But it's also a novel of reasoned youth tempering the more typical impetuous romanticism of war. Perhaps this is symbolized in his being an ambulance driver, dangerous enough, and not a combatant.  The events leading to his disillusion and consequent farewell to arms, occur not as typical youthful epiphanies, ricocheting from one extreme (idealism, romanticism) to another (disillusionment, cynicism), but as an almost inevitable and slowly acting corrosive as the war continues to unfold in front of him, brought into final play during the retreat in the Battle of Caporetto.  The description of the retreat is the highlight of the novel, beginning with its orderly nature to the joining in of refugees and its later almost complete disintegration into panic and unlawfulness. It's brilliant and completely convincing. You can see and feel it unfold right before you.  Everyone points out that Hemingway was a former newspaperman and his use of short, terse sentences.  Sure, but the fictional prose value of most newspaper people is nowhere--just surface description with little else. Not so for Hemingway. Embedded in his short sentences is feeling, emotion, and, in few words, vidid, deep description. It's what gives the substantial meaning and value to his work well beyond the superficial surface of the news report, even while in the heritage of that style.  I mean, how many reporters win the Nobel prize for Literature as did Hemingway. Read this book and you'll have an idea why 
 I had just returned from a trip to Russia when I came across this little book purporting to explain the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union. I've read other works on russian and Soviet history, but have never come across such a clear presentation of the issues to consider. Other reviewers have suggested that there's too much political bias in the account and that it's boring. I did not find this at all (especially the boring part), and I've always had a sympathy for the Left. Indeed, when I was in Russia and witnessed first hand the impressive and awe-inspiring achievements of Soviet and Czarist Russia (as well as some of the more horrific ones) I asked people to explain to me what caused the collapse of the Soviet Union, an idealist experiment that went wrong disappointing so many who hoped for a better system. You cannot help but ask these questions as you see the unbelievable luxury and wealth  in Moscow and parts of St. Petersburg with the obvious poverty that co-exists with it. Yet, as the notes of the soviet anthem so poignantly reflect, The Soviet Union was supposed to herald a new era in human relations. Of course, reality has a way of breaking dreams and I believe that Stephen Kotkin has captured the illusion and its collapse, outlining the reasons and the effcts with unprecedented clarity. perhaps, more than this, Kotkin offers a model for analyzing the problems faced by all regimes as they attempt a reform from within and is a very effective text to understand politics in much of the developing world and I found personally usful in studying such regimes as  Egypt under Sadat and Mubarak, Qadhafi's in Libya, or Asad of Syria. It's definitely a short book that travels very far 
 This book is inspiring, moving, thought-provoking, and smart. Not only did I love it...it loved me back. It challenged me to think more sincerely about what I could be doing, and to continue my daily work to align with my Higher Purpose. And it confirmed my impressions of Ms. Huffington -- highly intelligent, conscious, purposeful, compassionate, tenacious, loving, and of course fearless -- a woman who wants all people to practice self-love and to experience dignity and a good life and who will show up to do her part in making that a reality. 
 "It just does not get bloodier, colder, or more delightfully real than Joe Pike and Elvis Cole in Crais's series set in the always dark and brooding underbelly of a Los Angeles full f lying cops and arrogant rich kids. No heroes here, just great characters. 
 W. L. Warren's excellent monograph on the first Plantagenet king displays a superb narrative style and an authoritative thoroughness of detail, which nonetheless remains surprisingly approachable for a work of this length and depth.  This depth is remarkable: one can open the book to any chapter and read it independently without feeling that one is missing key details.  Yet the book manages to steer free of a sense of drudgery or redundancy, even while effecting such an admirable encapsulated quality for its chapters.  I can hardly wait to read his book on King John 
 This is one of my absolute favorite books.  It's one of those that you just cannot put down.  I don't want to ruin the end, which is the best part, but it is mind-blowing!  
 As Manilow's music goes, his fifth studio release, "Even Now" tops them all. I grew up on Manilow. Both of my parents were fans, so between Dad, Mom and myself, we owned his entire collection up through 1983. I also was (and still am) a pianist taking lessons from the Eastern WA University professor. Instead of practicing as I should have, I spent many a weekend working out Manilow's tunes - some at Dad's request, some of my own choosing.   Having said this, I became well acquainted with his albums and after 20+ years, "Even Now" is still as fresh as it was when I first heard it in high school. It released four hits ("Copacabana," "Even Now," "Somewhere In The Night," and "Can't Smile Without You") and Manilow won a Grammy for "Copa." Each song is a work of craftsmanship, with memorable melodies and phenemonal orchestration. Manilow's vocals are strong and display his wide range. There is much variety on this album, from disco to his typical power ballads, to just he and the piano.   Manilow has gotten a lot of bad press over the years from his overly-sentimental (sappy) love songs. If one listens to this album in its entirety, one will discover that this is just not the case. To really understand his style, this album is a good starting point. Listen to it and you'll discover a wealth of top-quality music.  
 First off let me say that this review is on the VHS version of the movie.  I was hoping to purchase the DVD that would correct the problems evident in the VHS.  It appears that the problems have remained..grateful to all those reviewers who saved me from buying just another format of the same problems.  It seems that Disney just copied the the film exactly like the VHS nothing more. By the way, that is one of the great benefits of Amazon reviewing...it hopefully prevents us from wasting money.  The problem now is how to rate it..a 5 star movie on a 2 star format.  Perhaps it was a money issue with Disney...they felt that the effort wasn't worth the return.  Whatever the reason it is really a corporate shame to treat this movie so poorly.  The movie is one of those old Disney family fares that conveys the magic of the Disneyland when Walt was running the show.  It stars the great Peter Ustinov who carries the movie and lights up the screen with his humor and presence.  He has so many great lines of pirate seafaring dialogue that is a treat to hear(no swearing). He plays off of Dean Jones, who by the way does a great job himself as the College coach who unwittingly releases Blackbeard from limbo..between heaven and hell.  Blackbeard now has to do a  good deed to be set free to his just reward...'Help an old lady across the street? That's silly!".  The movie is typical Disney's formulaic as they try to help Blackbeard's descendants save the old boarding house.  Suzanne Pleshette stars as the romantic interest and several of the standard Disney stock players fill in the rest.  My favorite scene is when Ustinov and Jones lock arms and head off to take on Silky and the Boys singing a revised version of "Heart of Oak" to be joined by Pleshette.."I'm not letting you go in there alone".  No CGI's here but lots of physical comedy and a great performance by Ustinov.  Here's hoping Disney can get their act together and tranfers this movie in widescreen..getting the aspect ratio right..as it deserves.  Even if for nothing more than letting the younger generation enjoy the work of the great Peter Ustinov.  
 This is a remarkable book.  Well-thought out, inspirational and well-researched.  The stories of the author, her "soul sisters" and figures from her-story are clean and clear and relevant.  The exercises are simple and thought provoking.  A wonderful gift to re-ignite the feminist spirit in any woman and to compliment traditional and non-traditional religious paths!  Get one for all your soul sisters and form a circle as suggested-I sense it will focus your life and change the face of women in the world! 
 I think what throws everyone off is that they think they can learn the creative process of writing from Syd Field.  I don't think you can.  In my mind writing is two activities.  Learning to create/write (which is not something you are going to learn from any of syd field's books)  and learning to edit your work into a format where it makes sense and you can edit it.  He comes entirely from the perspective of an editor.  The problem is that he's marketing his services to people who are writing, and if you read all the complaints they are people who aren't getting what they need on the creating end of the deal.  I think if you buy his books keep in mind that is only for the editing part.  A lot of writers don't like the editing part, but it is necessary.  I also write poetry for instance, and there are so many poets who just create and never edit what they do, and they just leave it like they created it but it isn't fine tuned.  It's not like a snapshot.   All Mr. Field is really trying to say is that there are firm rules by which this process operates and they expect to see x happen on y page, or back it goes.  That's an important thing to keep in mind, and I'm thankful he's shared his perspective.  Even if a person may not like him, that doesn't matter.  He offers an important perspective, and without it a lot of writers wouldn't have the firm guidelines that they need.  They need to know the rules.  i don't think we like rules, but it's good to know what they are.  Like it or not.   Hopefully that clarifies things a little.  For the creating part get books from someone else, for the editing part, Mr. Fields books are helpful.   
 Easily one of No Doubt's finest, the Beacon Street Collection stars amazing frontwoman Gwen Stefani in the band's early, raw, ska sound. A must-have for hardcore ND fans!  
 I bought this to use for movie nights that we host.  Right out of the box I was able to get a batch of popcorn going.  The only downside that I can see is the pot is not easy to thoroughly clean.  However, the unit seems to be made solidly and a terrific value 
 I am not new to digital cameras. This camera, overall, is more usable than any digital camera I have or have had. I've owned and used the camera for 7 months as of May 06.  I have owned Olympus, Sony and Fuji Digital cameras. This camera by far, as the easiest menus to navigate and are easy to navigate quickly without reading the instructions.  The back display is huge and bright, glass reinforced, which a lot of competitors do not have. This keeps away scratches and smashes.  The casing is real metal, so you do not have to baby it, and finally, the size and shape of this camera make it very convenient to carry in the front pocket of jeans with no problems.  This is the RAZR of digital cameras, in my opinion. It is ready to take pictures very quickly from when you open the lens cover.  The rechargable battery has never died on me before I ran out a 1 GB memory card.   The flash is adequate but a bit slow to recharge. This is not a problem for me however, because I chose this camera for two unique features, First-- "Natural Light Mode"-- a "flash off" mode that enhances pictures with natural light. I take most of my pictures, even indoors, with no flash, because I like the look of natural light. This camera is great at capturing under those conditions.  The second feature I like about the camera is called "PhotoChrome" mode-- it richens colors and makes pictures sort of a "technicolor" look. Print worthy in many cases. I use this in conjunction with the Natural Light Mode.  The only drawbacks I could think of with this camera is that because of the screen size/vs megapixel, sometimes you think a photo has come out clearly by looking at the screen, but if you didn't use flash and moved (which obviously makes pictures blurry) it will show up blurry at full size when you download it to the PC.  The only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because in super low light situations the fact that a picture is 5 megapixels but you view it on the LCD tricks you to thinking the picture was captured clearly when you might have a slight blur at full size. This may be true of all cameras, I don't know.  This is an auto focus camera.  You will get incredibly clear pictures of close ups and regular photos, but you have to let it focus.  This is not a "wail your arms around while on a dance floor and snap pictures" camera. Many people detract from the camera because they want it to be a fixed focus camera for situations like described above. Tempting because it is so portable and stylish, but this camera fills the needs of much more than a fixed focus.  I have a 4 megapixel Fuji S3100 for situations where I need mega zoom, but, who wants to lug around a camera bag on the trip to the mall or walmart or work? I also own a Sony DSC-P72 which is not bad at anything, but isn't great at anything either, and is too big and hogs batteries. Previously I owned Olympus digital cameras.  I've found the 5 megapixels of the Z1 more than adequate, and I often shoot in 2 or 3.  I have the black edition. It does show finger prints. If I had it to do again I'd choose the silver only for that reason.  I carry this camera often because its so convenient, and often those pictures I'd have missed by only owning a larger camera and not lugging it along are captured because of how convenient it is to carry this camera along. Its no burden at all to travel with, produces great results, battery lasts long, and is durable.  
 I found this book to be exactly as I hoped for. I am a co-founder of Garden State Ghost Hunter Society, and I agree with the writter,that orbs are energy,not always dust particles. If that was the case,we would have dust particles in all pictures ever taken,not just the supposed haunted ones.Some ghost hunters believe that orbs are usually dust...then where is the dust in any pictures?The author leaves you to decide for yourself,and also has several good pictures to help out the investigator, and to learn by.There is more info on other subjests as well. Great book 
 This book provides a great holistic perspective on women's health issues (and is quite the eye-opener). It was recommended to me by my holistic health counselor.      This book gives women the knowledge and faith in themselves to care for themselves and to make informed decisions about their options.  We're not slightly shorter, curvier men, and Dr. Northrup takes that into account and celebrates it!  
 There are so many different dietary books on the market. Each one advocates their particular way of eating at the healthiest. Low fat-high fat, no-carb-high carb, you name it there's a book that has been written telling you benefits of that particular way of eating. Of the many and I do mean numerous books I have read on what constitutes a healthy diet, this is one of the very best.    It not only keeps the healthy fats in your diet, but also gives you plenty of fresh raw fruits and vegies. It tells you the importance of and how to for soaking your grains. It details the importance of puchasing organic food whereever it's available and fresh. As the author rightfully cotends, most organic fruits and vegetables travel long distances to get to you and are not always all that fresh. She rightfully, in my opinion, extols the virtues of farmer's markets. This is a five star book 
 When I first viewed this season I thought it was fairly poor compared to the other seasons, but after viewing it again it is much better the second time around! The season kicks off with 18 castaways stranded in the middle on an active volcanic island in the South Pacific. The two tribes Lopevi (red) and Yasur (yellow) are divided into men and women. Alliances are formed by age differences in both tribes when Brook & Dolly are the first two gone. Then in a game twist both tribes are sent to tribal council & John K wins immunity and is safe from tribal. John P and Mia are the two gome in the episode. the older men continue to show they have the numbers when brady is voted out. In a second twist, the two tribes have a tribal switch after an earthquake rocks the island, bubba is then voted out. Then Lisa is sent packing when she makes a comment to Ami. Then John K is ousted days before the merge. In the next episode the two tribes merge to form Alinta (orange) when Julie and Twila abondon the men to vote Rory out. The women continue to dominate when Sarge & Chad are eliminated. Chris is the last man standing but manages to get Scout, Twila and Eliza an his side blinsiding LeAnn, Twila is after accused of swearing on her sons life and going back on it. The four then continue to eliminate Ami then Julie. In the final four, Chris chooses to go with Twila when Eliza is ousted. When Chris wins final immunity, he votes Scout out. In an emotional final tribal council Chris becomes the sole survivor beating Twila 5-2. I would not say this to be the best season, however a great one! It's funny to watch the women fall apart when they have the game wrapped up, Chris is definitely one of the best strategic players to ever play the game. I do wish the dvd had more special features, but the commentary is funny because Julie always talks about Jeff when he appears (Jeff Probst & Julie Berrie are dating). But overall, a fantastic DVD Box Set of a fantastic season of survivor, like all,               The Tribe Has Spoken 
 This is a beautiful film that makes you cry and laugh and at the same time.  Although one could critisize that it uses certain klischees and stereotypes we all know that if you open your heart things like that can and do actually happen in "real" life.  Overall very inspiring, I love this film!  P.S. Bless all who resist it's magic... ; 
  Donald Shomette is an underwater archeologist and this book is about three archeological and historical "digs" made in Maryland since the mid '70s:  1. Robots Beneath the Chesapeake: about the investigation of the ship New Jersey, which sank carrying pottery and other items; the discovery of this wreck and its cargo led to a bill in Maryland that now protects underwater sites from vandals and poachers;  2. Melted Beads: about the location of the earliest settlement in Maryland, on Kent Island;  3. The Ghost Fleet of Mallows Bay: about a ship graveyard along the Potomac River where many WW I wooden steamships were scuttled.  Shomette is an excellent writer and is thorough in his presentation. He looks at a great deal of information, on-site evidence and historical records, and lays out clearly and not too technically what it all means. I found the investigation of the oldest settlement in Maryland to be the most interesting, and the evidence is not at all clear-cut. Shomette looks at it all, however, and weighs various sites one against the other using the tools of history and archeology. A fascinating book 
 I was already a fan of Montrose's work (Dogtionary and Cationary), but she really tipped the scales with LIGHTWEIGHTS! This is the most adorable dog book I have EVER seen--I know, I have them all.  The dogs are cute--puppies actually--and the colors and scales too sweet for words.  Run, don't walk, to buy this book! 
    Elizabeth Berg has a wonderful way of befriending readers. This book presented the refreshing message that writing need not be an excruciating experience. Sometimes, writing comes naturally. I am in the middle of writing a novel, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the writing process so far. I agree with Elizabeth--if writing is torture for you, try doing something else!     Among other things, the book discusses how to deal with rejection, and success. The author points out that success may divide people because it invokes the old green monster: jealousy. Elizabeth Berg included a fabulous piece of writing created by her best friend who described the jealousy she experienced when E.B. became a famous, published author.     Overall, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The recipes in the back are a wonderful bonus. Try this one--you won't be disappointed 
 As a parent in a transracial adoption, I am continually frustrated by the anorexic selection of role models for my African-American child in  children's literature.  I try to surround my child with deafening messages  of self-love and self-worth and celebrate the beautiful brown hue!  This  book takes passages of the bible and translates it into self-empowering  beliefs for a child of any color.  The illustrations are warm and  well-done, the text is simple, but poetic.  The book itself is sturdy and  can take a beating.  I adore this book.  It cost a little more than most  other children's books, but it's well worth it 
 Short Circuit is one of those films I rented as a kid back in the precious 80s when we got so many good family movies that just wouldn't see the light of day in these awful times. A Short Circuit made in 2007 would be mind-numbingly PC with bullet-time effects and a CGI Johnny voiced by a hip-hop 'artist'. It's a grim time for this genre indeed. But back in 1986 I had nothing to complain about as most of the family movies from that decade are fondly remembered as classics.  I loved this movie as a kid and it's been a long, long time since I watched it from start to finish. Plus the VHS I rented back then was in horrid pan and scan with half the picture chopped-off. Which is a real shame since John Badham shot it brilliantly-framed Panavision. So I've never really seen the FULL movie until now. How does it hold-up 21 years later? Well, I guess you could say Johnny Five is kinda dated but not so much as all the rest of the 'ground-breaking' technology at the Nova factory. Number Five is a robot made for Military Stealth purposes and armed with a laser beam. But designer Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) and his partner Ben Jabituya (a non-Indian and very funny Fisher Stevens) originally designed him as a marital aid, apparently. They are unhappy with the way Nova has marketed the robot but after a demonstration to the Military, Five is struck by lightning and assumes consciousness. Needing input and desperate to learn more about his surroundings, he escapes the factory and journey's across Oregon, soaking up knowledge and the idiosyncrasies of modern human culture. As a reflection of today's 'zany' society, Five is full of spirit, personality and random pop-culture references.  The Military are kinda annoyed at a potential lethal weapon (not the Mel Gibson kind) running loose about America, so it's their new mission to find him and destroy him. Five, who has been taken in by animal-lover (not in THAT way) Stephanie Speck (a gorgeous Ally Sheedy) does everything he can to stay out of harm's way. But they are persistent and won't let him live because they don't believe he is truly alive.  It's not totally original since some of it feels inspired by the works of Issac Asamov and I doubt a film like this would have been green-lighted had E.T. not been so successful. But it is very enjoyable and funny and Johnny Five is a great character despite being nothing more than a puppet. Short Circuit is definitely a film for any kid born in the 80s. The video-game obsessed kids of today might to be so interested but its charming simplicity and good-natured story will never really date despite the old-fashioned 'cutting-edge' technology featured in the film.  This DVD from Image Entertainment contains a NON-anamorphic 2.35:1 transfer with Dolby 5.1 sound and a commentary among a few other extras. I believe it also comes in a crappy snapper case. The UK DVD from Cinema Club however IS anamorphic but drops the commentary and has Dolby 2.0 sound. The rest of the extras remain. I'll take superior picture over the rest any day 
 Absolutely outstanding.  A bit slower in pace than some of the earlier Harry Bosch novels but much more realistic and interesting.  Character development is superb and the reading by Len Cariou makes the audio version very entertaining.  The maturity of Harry's approach to homicide investigation is refreshing though he still retains his abrasive manner with police administration personnel.    Looking forward to the next novel in the series 
 The book was okay, but the section of Ms.Johnson was amazing. I was moved it touched me.  She is a miracle women and I love her. Thank you Ms.J for inspiring me 
 This book was a great help for me to try and figure out my unpredictable cat.  It explains why cat's do what they do and treatment options for the cat to calm down their behavior.  I have visited several vet's with no luck  and I think I finally have gotten Tigger's attacking behavior under control  after reading this book.  It's a must have for cat owners 
 I got this to read to my kids while we learned about the French Indian War.  It was absolutely marvelous.  It gave you a wonderful feel of the times and the struggles the early settlers faced.  It was the story of a family captured by Indians and separated in a time of war. It tells of hope kept alive while they go from one crisis to the next waiting to be reunited.  It is mostly the story of a young girl trying to grow into a young woman in a strange place and foreign culture and her decision to follow her heart 
 2pac is a legacy of our generation..he is and will always be the best, not only was he an awesome rapper, but he was also a good actor and poet. This book is very well done and covers so much. When he was shot the first time 5 times..and leading up to his unjustly death..i recommend this book to anyone if they want to learn about 2pac, he wasnt a bad man or a gangsta like most assume, he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time..or he just got involved with the wrong ppl...and like he said live by the gun..die by the gun..and that is exactly what happened to this man...may he rest in peac 
 Eddi McCandry is singer in a rock and roll band. And on that fateful night just before her boyfriend dumps her, a man watches her all night long while she sings. On the way home after being dumped she is chased by the man from the bar and a huge black dog. This is how the Fair folk introduce themselves to Eddi.  The Fair folk, the Gray Strangers, Fairies though they hate that name, have decided that Eddi will be the one to bring the benefits of mortal blood to the battle field as they battle against the Queen of Air and Darkness and her army. The benefits of mortal blood you ask.... death, the ability to die or be killed.  As the war turns against the Seelie Eddi finds herself matched in a battle of wits against the Queen of Air and Darkness. The stakes; the life of Eddi and her body guard the Phouka and the city of Minneapolis, whether or not the Seelie or the Unseelie will hold Minneapolis for the next 490 years.  For those that love Laurell K. Hamilton's Meredith Gentry series this is an absolutely wonderful little tale to spend some time with till the next book comes out! 
 Most of the examples in this book are vests (which I don't typically wear) but if you translate the design concepts into other projects, this book then becomes an inspirational resource.    I have quite a stash of fabrics, both garment & upholstery/drapery pieces...I crazy quilt, but many items in my "stash" include large motifs or motifs on background colors that I don't particularly like. This book has given me the ideas and techniques to use those pieces in more creative ways.    One of the most incredible parts of each example piece the author displays are the LININGS! I'd never thought about embellishing the interior of garments but as a result of this book, I'm planning to do so on a swing-coat I'm about to make (using crazy quilting).  What a wonderful way of dealing with the exposed underside of garments that have movement.     And, by the way, unlike one reviewer suggested, I'm not a "surburban housewife" or a friend of the author.  
 The music and the insert could each stand on their own as powerfully moving pieces. Together they open the heart and mind to new understandings. At once transcendental and grounding, Innovators can be merely a lovely musical encounter or a growth experience. Either way, you'll want to listen again and again 
 after searching on the internet i found amazon to be the place where this item had the lowest price. fast delivery, great product. fits great with my panasonic 6 megapixels camera. fine leather. could not be any happier with the product 
 This is one of the most admirable and fresh films of any age. A true tour de force that invites us to enjoy and delight with the joy of living. Renoir the son, paid a more than deserved to his father with this post card movie, plenty of smart situations with a wonderful Jean Gabin and the most beautiful woman in the world in those ages: Maria Felix.  The film is a glorious homage to Paris, depicting minuciously through every little frame every angle of this lovely city through anorigibal stage: since I got it in 1990, I have to watch it at least once every year. A colossal and superb artistic film that finds in Renoir the perfect director in the peak of his creative powers. This is the artistic answer given by France to "An american in Paris", and John Huston's"Le Moulin Rouge". Versatile imaginative, sumptuos and ravishing fil 
 Well now I am not much of a Pokemon fan as I used to be. Before when I saw these movies I thought they were great! Yea it can get boring in some parts but in all it's pretty good. Personally I liked the second movie the best. Then the first. The 3rd got a little boring for me. But that might be becuz I started loosing intrest to Pokemon or in other words, Pocket Monsters. In all I would buy this set 
 I love this magazine(not because of the big ole booty's), because of the way they present the ladies. I have never seen a cover of King showing some skinny, no meat eating, starving her self to death type chic! They show real women, with real shapes. It shows how women look in the real world! I love it, and yeah I must admit, I do love the big ole booty's!! Sorry Ladies, I am a man! LoL 
 Margie McArthur has given us a visionary guidebook in terms of working with faery lore and healing, while retaining the authenticity of research that I've appreciated in her other work. Meticulous attention to detail, lyrical prose, and helpful rituals and exercises make this book an important addition to the bookshelf on several levels. I am more than impressed by this work, and highly recommend it to my readers and students.  Yasmine Galenor 
 Excellent thriller.  Keeps your interest and pulls you further into the book.  I love Iles' books 
 I really enjoyed reading about Joyce Johnson's childhood family. What a crew! I enjoyed reading about her life with Jim Johnson -- her descriptions of their marriage made his death really poignant. But I wasn't all that fascinated by Peter Pinchbeck. I realize the book is "Missing Men," but he was just too missing for me. I never really understood him. I would have preferred to know more about her career in publishing and the fascinating people I'm sure she met. But that wasn't the point of the book, I guess. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about women's lives 
 This thing is really easy to install and mount a flat-screen TV.  The only piece of advice I'll pass on is to get a #3 Phillips screwdriver for driving those bad-boy screws into the studs.  If you're not sure what a #3 is, it's probably one size bigger than what you have 
 wonderful movie such emotional resonance e 2 young male leads were amazin especially max riemelt... the story and pace of the movie is kept tight and concise.... simple story but beautifully shot and directed.... so much better than tons of american movies out there anyone who hasnt given foreign language movies a try shld at least rent this to have a look! u won't regret it 
 This is the darling story of The Little Mermaid in a shortened, Golden Book version. It's the perfect length for a bedtime story for my 4 year-old. I bought lots of them and gave them as party favors for my daughter's Little Mermaid party. They were hit because it's a favor the kids actually keep instead of a bunch of trinkets. Enjoy 
 If you like Babyface -- this is a must.  All the hits on one C.D.  No need to look through your C.D. collection to find that special Babyface song.  Betcha ten to one, that song is on this C.D.  
 A murder mystery set at the scene of the glitz and glitter of show business.  What more could a reader ask for in the way of sheer entertainment.  Written only as Nora could, Private Scandals begins with a murder and then flashes back to begin the buildup of the plot.  Deanna Reynolds, TV news reporter for Chicago-based Midday and hostessing her own little segment of Deanna's Corner and Finn Riley, major international news reporter are our main characters.  When Deanna decides to branch out and try her very own talk show, in direct competition with her not-so-gracious mentor, Angela Perkins, someone out in TV land decides he/she is obsessed with her to the point that no one else can go near her.  Finn, being the typical mucho male figure in the story becomes enchanted with our star and is determined to protect her at any cost.  There are a cast of characters - co-workers at the network and friends, who become suspect to the reader as possible threats to our heroine.  As other reviewers have made it a point to say that the villain was obvious, I must say I was totally surprised by the outcome.  I have read many Nora Roberts books including the entire J.D. Robb series to date, and I was completely taken by surprise by the identity of the stalker.  I would definitely recommend this story to anyone who enjoys a "who done it" tale with the lush background of show business and the trials and tribulations of the climb to the top of the ladder of success.  
 This book is a very long read, but the details and the descriptions make it unbelievably entertaining and educational.      I would recommend this to anyone interested in the field of microbiology or just someone who is plain curious about learning about disease outbreaks, the people who fight them and what the future holds in store for us in regards to different diseases.        A very in-depth book, one of the best I've read in a long time, the author put this together very well and it is a book that anyone could get into, just plain outstanding!   
 When the first film in the epic "Lord of the Rings" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, "The Two Towers." Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?   Fortunately moviegoers only had to wait a year for the answer, when "The Two Towers" debuted in December 2002. The second part of Peter Jackson's astounding adaptation lacks the surprise of the first movie, but it continues the strong storytelling, amazing acting, and one of the greatest battles of the silver screen.   The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.   Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted.   "The Two Towers" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of "Fellowship of the Ring," and the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth. It's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.   This film is much darker than the first movie, although we still get some funny moments from Gollum and the hobbits, but some creepy ones as well. Gollum/Smeagol's argument with himself is absolutely chilling. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.   But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard. The scripting is impeccable, mixing the funny moments ("Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!" Pippin wails when a "tree" speaks to them) with the dramatic speeches, and ending with a simple, powerful speech by Sam.   And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.   Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust. Sean Astin's performance grows as well, as he does whatever it takes to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths, whatever.   But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too, including a love triangle involving Aragorn and the warrior-maid Eowyn, and Legolas and Gimli becoming best buddies (even competing to see who kills the most orcs). McKellen gets to play "Gandalf 2.0," a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman. The scene where he sees the ents attacking is outstanding.   This edition contains both versions of the movie -- the original, shorter theatrical version, and the second extended edition with lots of extra footage. While the first one has nostalgia value, the second is undoubtedly the best.   The extra scenes cause the movie to cleave more closely to the original novel, although the handling of the Faramir character comes as a mild shock. Extra scenes are inserted, like Merry and Pippin enjoying the ents' hospitality. There is also a special documentary filmed behind the scenes, apparently to draw in completists who need everything made about "Lord of the Rings."   The journey continues in "The Two Towers," crammed with so much action and pathos that it never has time to suffer from "middle chapter syndrome." An amazing continuation 
 This book is an excellent resource and covers all topics in a sufficient and easy to read manner and definitely covers all the "elements".  Anyone that is interested in Photogrammetry will find this book quite useful 
 This dvd is a history of the censorship problems the Smothers Brothers had with CBS back in the 1960's.  They show some clips, talk to the Smothers Brothers and some of the writers (including Steve Martin and Mason Williams), and tell the story of the constant struggle they had to get their stuff on the air.   It's funny to look at the things they got in trouble for and compare them to what's on TV today.  I also found it interesting to hear that Tommy Smothers was the real radical, always trying to get more political.    If you're too young to remember the show, it was a variety show, and they got into trouble for protesting the war in Vietnam, racism and the stupidity of the people running the country.    To me, it was worth the price of the disc just for the minute or two of Pat Paulsen.  This is not a best of show, where they just show a bunch of clips, but it is an entertaining look at the show, the censorship and the 1960's 
 This book isn't too bad. It's written by a coach, so it's packed with information. They have lots of things, like high school, college, and NBA rules, what assists, steals, blocks, and turnovers are, how to score, and even the popular pickup basketball. Nobody really knows that basketball with that name, but it's full court ... off etc... It also shows the managing of a team and 2000's most money- earning players (Shaq). It also has top players and games in history! Not bad overall, but could make the offensive plays, defensive plays, and moves a bit easier to understand 
 I've got disappointing news for Daniel Cano: Reliance on categorization is a tool of the undereducated.  Ironic that this "education" you've claimed is one which falls far short of many more intelligent listeners.  A more sophisticated approach than "categorization and condemnation" is to break each band down until you hear and understand how their unique combination of styles fits together.  To prove my example, what would you think of someone who lumped all "heavy metal" together, and distinuished good old "rock and roll" from that "screaming and loud noise that all sounds the same".  As fans of heavy metal we know that they haven't listened enough to discern a difference.  Its like self-centered white kids thinking that all black or asian people look the same(or vice versa).  As for Underoath, I think that they have accomplished finding a niche in the area of metal which I really don't have other bands.  And its an appealing niche to me.  I think this band probably does fit the emocore moniker, but I don't listen to most of the bands that are classified as such and can't say that they are standard "emocore".  All I know is that they're heavy and light at the same time, that the emotion really flows through in a way that doesn't seem whiny despite the reputation, and the songs must be well written to stay in my head (a welcome stay - unlike that damn Price is Right theme that won't go away).    I should mention that the singer on this album is not as appealing to me as their new singer. I don't like how he stays in the same high pitched range, but they still have good background vocals and its not enough to really damage them. You can look at it as a more raw and hard edged sound too - something in the vein of Poison the Well's opposite of december being great despite the improvement in vocals of the new album (if you can agree with that in the first place).  So as most reasonable reviews should end, you must hear for yourself.  I think most open minded metal fans would like them, I know I do 
 Hoo-eee! is what I said when I got through looking at this book. I didn't actually say it, on account I was in an 'alternative' bookstore in my godniece's neighborhood, and I didn't want all those howyoucallits looking crosswise.  These pitchers are beautiful, strange, and haunting, like in the way LaToya Janckson is. Imagine those big-eyed kid paintings only if painted by the drippy-clock guy, or if he was on goofy tablets.  At anyhoo, if you like surreal art dont miss this one.  I dont know what they teach at Rhode Island art school these days but it aint "Draw Tippy!&quot 
 The original Broadway cast album of MY FAIR LADY is a mandatory disc in every self-respecting musical fan's collection.  It captures the cast at the top of their game, and Julie Andrews at the peak of her Broadway career.  Her voice is sparkling and effervescent, with Rex Harrison as a thrilling Higgins and Stanley Holloway a delight as Eliza's erstwhile father Alfred P. Doolittle.  The monaural sound is warm and lush in Columbia's best style.  This newest remaster of the album sounds better than ever.  By the time the London cast album was recorded 4 years later (to take advantage of the new stereo format), a tired feeling had crept into Julie Andrews' singing (or perhaps boredom), so the Broadway edition is the format of choice, despite the technical limitations of the mono mix 
 MISS E...SO ADDICTIVE is by far her best work....i can play this cd on the way to club and get my whole crunk on... straight club...  hands down '4 my people' w/ eve is my favourite track on the album.... i love this song to def... straight club song.  eve's flow is just tight. missy always keeps you crunk without all the yelling throught the entire song...  another track i love is 'one minute man' w/ ludacris and the version with jay-z... i just wish they had the video version on this album with everybody and trina. the video version was hot....one of timberlands best beats.  'take away' w/ tweet & ginuwine, 'get your freak on', 'x-tasy', and 'lick shots' are standouts on the album..   by this album if you wanna be hype all day long.  5 star 
 This is a very brief and tightly argued book of enormous relevance to us in 2004. It makes the following remarkable points:  1. On close inspection of individual opinions, the vast majority of the electorate in the U.S. are *moderate*, not radically polarized into liberals and conservatives. That is, most of us are, as we would like to believe, capable of thinking independently for ourselves rather than strictly along party ideological lines.   We are a _closely_divided_ nation, as reflected in the very close recent elections, however we are NOT a _*deeply*_divided_ nation. That is, we are not really a nation of two distinct warring camps and a couple of swing states as the media sometimes present it for dramatic purposes. Fiorina sugests that we are actually something close to an ambivalent nation which divides itself in poltitical matters because we have no choice when presented with highly divided options.   2. The American public has *not* become dramatically polarized even over such hot topics as abortion. Rather, relatively small differences among us have been magnified by the rhetoric used to present the issues to us.   3. The political choices we have are determined by a distinct class of politicians, party activists, and interest group leaders, who *have* become increasingly polarized over moral and religious ideology as well as economic ideology.  4. A large part of the polarization of the political class has been the result of the realignment of the South, such that republicans aligned aggressive foreign policy with hostility to the welfare state, and democrats aligned antiwar sentiment with support of those at risk. This is represented particular well by the "gender gap" which widened at the same time this realignment or tuning of the ideologies of the parties was taking place.  Fiorina suggests that when Bill Clinton once said early in his presidency that he was Pro-Choice, but against abortion, most Americans knew what he meant, that most of us, liberal or conservative, do not want to legislate morality for others, even though we have a clear sense of what is right and wrong. Fiorina also points out for example that most 80% of us believe that abortion should be legal under some conditions (even if wrong), and illegal under others. The extremes at each end which promote unconditional rights for unborn babies or for mothers are roughly the 10% tail at either side of a normal curve.   Finally, he also provides data showing that the averaged opinions of self-identified liberals and conservatives regarding abortion differ only regarding under what specific conditions they think abortion should be legal, not the legality of abortion in general.   The result is that the supposed "culture war" is really a war between increasingly ideologically polarized political parties and their activists who arent really even aware of each others reasoning, with most of us in the middle getting hit by friendly fire from both sides, but being forced to choose between them.  The bottom line for Fiorina's argument here is that we are a nation currently creating unneccessary internal conflicts and indulging in "culture war" polarized issues like gay marriage or unconditional rights of various kinds that are really of concern to a relatively small and unrepresentative number of us. They are sold to us by political parties and the media because of their drama rather than their relative importance. It's hard for me to look at the political ads for either of the current candidates in 2004 without nodding agreement on this.  Our political system provides us with ideological extremism on both sides, and seems to have no desire or ability to change itself, whereas most of us caught in it would usually prefer pragmatic and non-ideological solutions to issues that address larger numbers of us.   I read this at the same time at Juergensmeyer's book "Terror in the Mind of God," and it is chilling how much the "culture war" among the political elites comes to resemble the "cosmic war" of good and evil that Juergensmeyer theorizes leads to real violence under some conditions. If Fiorina is right, we may not really have a (popular) culture war at all, but we could create one if it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as we come to accept it uncritically.  If Fiornia had a solution for this centrally important problem, this book would merit 6 or 7 stars. However, just by pointing it out so clearly, it merits the highest rating I can give it.  Please read this important and timely book. 
 Mariah Stewart's New book Dark Truth is hot and very suspenseful, Mariah grabs ahold of you by the seat of your pants and holds you there until the stunning conclusion!

 This book is a great colection of essays by a brilliant thinker.  In essays ranging from topics such as crime, education, psychology, and management, Ackoff manages to outline what systems thinking is truly about.  Though I often did not agree with his prescriptions, the creative nature of his solutions very unique, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a thought provoking experience 
 No more half full cereal bowls with soggy cereal. The product is the perfect size serving. No more stale cereal either.Kids love it, with a favorite for everyone 
 I read Stephen's book late into the night and then got up and read more in the morning. The book not only brought me new understanding of the world of blindness, it spoke intimately of the journey of self-acceptance. Stephen's story is threaded through with grace, and his language is musical. A deeply spiritual memoir; you will finish it changed 
 I teach a college course that uses this book (it's a university-developed course that's required for all incoming students). The vast majority of my students get a great deal out of it. Many of them state that they wouldn't have picked up this book on their own, but that they are very glad to have read it. Most of my students are returning to school after absences of between two and twenty years. Some of them are instructors themselves (usually in the military), and start applying the techniques in the book to their own students (very successfully, I might add). It's a pleasure to be able to help people learn relatively simple tips to significantly improve their learning. One has to wonder how many of them might have been able to finish college straight out of high school had they been taught how they personally learn best. Unfortunately, most American schools don't seem to care what kind of learning style individual kids have. They just teach one way. If Conner's book were required reading for teachers, countless kids could benefit 
 One of the most amazing books ever it grabs you and wont let go it's just that goo 
 "Did Churches of Christ really begin as a unity movement? Why didn't I know that?" "You mean we used to be called Disciples of Christ? I thought that was just another denomination." "Churches of Christ today believe and practice the same things we have from the beginning, don't we?"  Statements like these by members of the Churches of Christ reflect a serious lack of knowledge of our past and an increasing desire by many to know more of their heritage. That desire has led us to believe there is a need for a brief account of the history of Churces of Christ. This book hopes to serve newcomers and even long-time members of the church by giving them insights into our heritage. It also is an introduction to this significant group of churches for those unfamiliar with its place in American Christianity.  However, any attempt to look at one's spiritual ancestry is as pleasurable and painful as examining ones family tree. Some ancestors and family stories make us swell with pride; others we would just as soon forget. We are two insiders to Churches of Christ writing with a deep appreciation for those who have gone before us. We would in no way bash the church of our mothers and fathers. But as honest historians, we must present our story as we see it, "warts and all." --- excerpt from book's Prefac 
 This is an extremely good way to become familiar with Bayesian methods.  Most books don't help you through things to the degree that this one does.  It starts with really basic principles necesary to understand Bayesian principles and goes all the way through MCMC techniques like Gibbs Sampling and simulated annealing.  I especially like the way many of the intermediate steps are included rather than assuming the reader has the time to work through all of them.  A nice addition to my methodology bookshelf 
 Great Movie ! Can't argue that but the DVD lets it down a bit. The menu items do not work properly unless the dvd i bought is faulty? Nice cover though. 
 This classic work is still on my bookshelf, well-thumbed and well-loved after 34 years of being part of my life. I can't recommend this highly enough  
 Well obviously if youre into Kant you have to buy this book. Allen Wood (I  took two courses with him last year) is perhaps The Kant Scholar alive  today (him and Paul Guyer). Hes a really interesting guy to talk to as  well: quite a radical, Marxist I think, and hes got a deep and I mean DEEP  commitment to egalitarianism. This said his book which I bought last year  was very interesting. Basically Wood tries to paint Kants ethical thought  more attractively than most of us have usually seen it as. Some things I  liked about the book were that he really proved his point about an  overemphasis on the Formula of Universal Law, and his contention that  Kant's ethical thought really is deeply rooted in his somewhat pessimistic  realistic view of human nature. I think however that Wood often dismisses  criticism or alternative viewpoints far too quickly and unconvincingly.  This would be I think the main detraction in his work. Also the tone of the  book at times is somewhat arrogant. Buy the book though. Very interesting  reading, a bit dry at times, but in general a must read for someone  interested in Kant 
 When the CD first came out in 2002, I started hearing them on the radio and on the College Television Network at school. After a short time I was really diggin' their music. I soon bought the album "Silver Side Up". Two songs that especially stood out to me was "Drift and Die", and "Blurry." I haven't heard much of their stuff since then, but as of now, this is my favorite with Puddle of Mudd 
 Tony Evans does a marvelous job of explaining to men the pitfalls that we face day in, day out.  His writing is very down-to-earth, and he does a great job of making Scripture references come alive with his interpretations of Scripture in today's world.  I highly recommend this as a book for men's group discussions.  My accountability group has been using it for our discussions.  This is a very easy read 
 This was a really well-told story interweaving a number of different plots--the childhood of the author, her father's experience in Siberia and his later escape from it, her mother's escape from occupied Poland into Italy, her aunt's life in Italy before WWII broke out, her parents' and aunt's childhoods, and events from the present day.  Ms. Fremont says in the beginning that she has filled in some gaps in her parents' and aunt's story with imagined details which she feels conveys the emotional truth of those experiences, which kind of seems like authors who make real-life characters be composites of multiple people involved in the story--sure it tells the story, but how well or accurately is another matter.    I'm glad that the author and her older sister found out their true identity (though it's surprising it took till they were in their thirties, given how many obvious clues were out there all throughout their childhoods), and that they found all of their new relatives at the end, people who were able to clue them in on other people in their family tree.  What I didn't like how they broke the news to their parents (and later to their aunt, against their mother's stern warnings not to).  Many survivors of tragic events, not just the Shoah, hid their true identities for decades, even their entire lives, to protect not just themselves but their children from possible future persecution.  Their daughters have no way of knowing what was going inside of their heads to make them make this huge decision, but certainly it wasn't done out of meanness or spite, to purposely keep their future children ignorant of their true history.  They had their reasons which they firmly believed in and shouldn't have to explain or justify them to anyone.  And the parents and the aunt doubtless reacted so angrily and emotionally to finding out the cat was finally out of the bag because of the way in which the news was conveyed.  It's like they didn't think ahead far enough to how these aging survivors might take this shock to the system.  Would you angrily confront your mother because, for example, you found out you had been fathered by a rapist and not the man you thought was your father?  That's like saying that it doesn't matter why the other party kept this secret; it's all about how you and you alone feel.  Zosia, the aunt, said that she was so traumatised by the events of the War that she literally forgot everything that happened before she escaped from Poland and back into Italy to her husband, even forgetting her sister's own name.  The mother even mentioned in passing that the day of the Petlura massacre, her period stopped for nine months; it's a wonder her children didn't grill her about that too, asking if she'd been raped and had a child.  Haven't these three elderly people been through enough?  No wonder they didn't approve of this book.  Some family secrets do need to come out of the closet, and this was certainly one of them, but the subject could have been broached in a way that was more sensitive to what the parents and aunt had suffered through.  You may feel better after finding out the truth, but exposing a painful family secret is about everyone involved and thinking ahead to how this might disrupt a formerly happy family inalterably.  The parents and aunt didn't even seem to have come to terms with what happened or achieved any sense of closure or inner-peace; indeed, Ms. Fremont reports that now they don't even speak about it anymore, after the initial period when they were telling them what had happened to them 
 I have had much success following the plan outlined in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to live a healthier lifestyle 
 I have been buying these bars every morning and the average price is $1.59.  The taste is sweet not chalky and does not leave a bad after taste.  I have tried many other carb bars and so far this one tastes better 
 This sequel to Michael Gleb's runaway bestseller focuses on the spiritual aspects of the seven steps to genius, expounded in his last text, including the need to seek the truth, taking responsibility for our thoughts, condition and actions, refining our self and outer awareness, analysing the dark components of our natures, striving for balance in all things and lastly, the cultivation of virtue, particularly love and compassion. Along with these spiritual steps are practical exercises to help us develop in these areas. These seven principles are designed and intended by the author to awaken our souls, prompt us to live in the moment, and ultimately realize the deep connection between all things in the universe.   One gets the impression that Michael Gleb has written this book directly from his heart. One senses a sincerity and clean desire to share everything he has discovered that has aided him in living a more meaningful existence. Intuitively I perceived a gut-level honesty in this book and a clear desire from the author to help his readers gain practical knowledge in order to live happier lives. Considering the vast amount of self-help manuals out there, all grappling for a piece of the self-improvement market, it was refreshing to read such an honest and well-written work. There is no question in my mind that Michael Gleb is sincere in his intention to share his seven principles, gently putting us on the road to living more meaningful lives.  We all have our areas of strengths and weaknesses, aspects of our lives that need honing or at least an honest assessment. For me it is living in the moment, not letting life pass by without experiencing all its wonders. For many years each day would more or less be taken for granted, thoughts preoccupied with memories of the past or worries about the future. The chapter on sharpening awareness has pointed me in the right direction to enjoy the moment, live in the moment, and experience the wonders of being aware in present time. Gleb also advises us on one of the age-old tenets of philosophy, first announced by the Greek philosopher, Socrates, and that was to "know thy self". The unexamined life is not worth living is a datum to live by that Gleb emphasises more that any of the other principles. It is an important one.  One does not have to read Michael Gleb's first book, "How to Think Like Leonardo Da Vince" in order to fully appreciate this one. He communicates Leonardo's seven principles in clean, easy to understand prose. The book is designed to read through once to then return and practice the exercises at the end of each chapter, which from personal experience, have great practical value.      
 The first time I became acquainted with Wally Lamb, I read "She's Come Undone" for an English Lit Course. Like many other's I adored the book, but was hesitant when I picked up "I Know This Much is True" for two reasons. First, it seems like nowadays that truly incredible books are hard to find. So what are the chances of finding two by the same writer? Secondly, the sheer length of the book (at just under 1000 pages) can be a little intimidating at first glance. And given my previous experiences with lengthy modern novels, I was ready for a big let down once again.   Yet, I was pleasantly surprised to find one of the best books I've read, EVER. Wally Lamb does such a great job when tackling seemingly controversial topics that most writers wouldn't dream of touching. Having worked with kids suffering from behavioral/mental disorders I was impressed by his potrayal of not only the effect of schizophrenia on the individual, but also the effect on the people surrounded by that individual. Granted he adds your occasional plot twist to add to the "story" (twins, flashbacks, ex-wives) he still manages to hit the nail on the head. Both Dominick and Thomas are so well rounded that you FEEL the angst and pain of every treacherous turn in the battle that both fight against Thomas's disease.  The novel evokes every human emotion possible and by the end you may find yourself smiling (or frowning) through the tears. I know I love a book that can make this happen and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for something absolutely incredible. And even better yet, despite the length of the book I couldn't put it down. By far it's one of the easiest 900 page reads I've ever picked up.  My only complaint, that the book had to come to an end.  
 I love this CD.  I put off buying it for awhile but am so glad I finally got it!  I love every song.  It's very relaxing on the slow songs, and upbeat & fun on the faster songs.  He's so talented, and everything he touches turns to gold.  Get this CD - it's GREAT 
 I first saw the ad for this DVD combo in Roling Stone in Junw 06 and I couldnt wait for it to be released.......I had the VHS copy for years and the quality was terrible.....THIS ROCKS!!!  What a song set.......it doesn't get any better than this!  I just wish the CD had the same song line-up.  BUY THIS!!!!!!! 
 Arthur Koestler, Darkness at Noon.  "It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma." That was how Winston Churchill described the Soviet Union.   If Churchill found the USSR mysterious he would have been totally perplexed by life in Albania during the isolated, despotic regime of Enver Hoxha.  Ismail Kadare's "The Successor" captures that inscrutable mystery in a masterful fashion.  Ismail Kadare is an Albanian poet and writer. He is also the winner of the first Man Booker International Prize in 2005 and was selected from a list of nominees that included Saul Bellow, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Naguib Mahfouz, Milan Kundera, and Gunter Grass.  His latest work published in English, The Successor, is a remarkable book that provides the reader with  evidence that Kadare's award  was well-deserved.  The "Successor" of the title is Mehmet Shehu.  Shehu was, until shortly before his death, Enver Hoxha's right-hand man. Shehu was a commander of a Communist-led partisan brigade during the Second World War and had a reputation for brutality that led to his promotion to a division commander of the National Liberation Army.  After the communist takeover of Albania Shehu led a purge of those party members suspected of being aligned with Yugoslavia's Tito after Tito's break with Stalin and the USSR.  Hoxha, referred to as "the Guide" throughout the book, took Shehu under his wing and Shehu was known throughout Albania as "Number 2".  As is often the case being "Number 2" was a precarious perch to sit on in regimes where aging tyrants (Stalin and Hoxha both come to mind) often struck out at those closest to them as their own mortality seemed to weaken them.  Shehu was no exception.  On December 17, 1981 after an apparent split with Hoxha over Albania's continued isolation from the world, Shehu was found dead in the bedroom of his newly renovated house.  A gunshot wound to the head was the cause of death, one quick ruled a suicide.  Shehu's death and the speculation as to the cause of his death form the heart of Kadare's "The Successor".  The book plays out like a parlor room mystery by Agatha Christie but one influenced by Franz Kafka's The Trial and Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon.  Neither the reader (nor anyone in Albania for that matter) knows whether the Successor committed suicide or was murdered.  All the doors to the house were locked, but there was a secret passageway installed during the house's renovation.  There are a number of possible suspects including the Guide, the Guide's "Number 3" man and successor to the successor, the Successor's wife and daughter and the daughter's former fiancé.  Kadare takes us into the tortured mind of all the suspects.  They each in their own way have some feeling of culpability for the Successor's untimely death, no mater the cause.  As we read the thoughts of each player in this parlor room drama Kadare paints a vivid portrait of life in Albania during the Hoxha regime.  The inexplicable, never to be determined cause of death is reminiscent of Kafka's The Trial.  The world of party purges where one, like the Successor, ends up accepting ones unhappy face as a result of a system he was partly responsible for bears a stark similarity to the atmosphere portrayed by Koestler in Darkness at Noon.  Kadare's prose is very well crafted even though this edition is a translation from the French which in turn is a translation from the original Albanian.  It must be hard to retain much of the original flavor of a novel after two translations but despite that hardship the chapters and scenes shift from real to dream-like in an almost unspoiled fashion.  This shift lends an aura of surrealism to the story, one that seems perfectly appropriate to a society for which surrealism was the norm rather than the exception.  Kadare's Successor is a wonderful, thoughtful book.  For anyone interested in Kadare's work, his Three Elegies for Kosovo was also one I found immensely enjoyable. Although both books deserve to be read, I think that my having read the somewhat more accessible Three Elegies for Kosovo first enhanced my enjoyment of The Successor.  However, The Successor stands up perfectly well on its own.   
 This DVD is awesome! Animal tells you everything that could possibly be told. It starts out from their days bouncing in bars to the untimely death of Road Warrior Hawk and everything in between. This DVD could not have been better 
 An excellent film that has in effect become a classic, Basic Instinct, brings to the screen a murder mystery involving a police detective and a sensual multi-millionaire writer.   The setting is San Francisco and detective Curran is investigating the gruesome murder of a man found dead in his bed after what seems to have been a passionate and steamy night.  The investigation reveals a purely sexual relationship between the deceased and a striking novelist whose life seems to be intertwined with various deadly accidents and mysterious deaths.  Things become rather complicated when her latest novel's hero oddly resembles detective Curran...  Michael Douglas, Sharon Stone and Jeanne Tripplehorn (both of whom are GORGEOUS!), Mitch Pileggi (X-Files), George Dzundza, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!  The film combines a great cast, a great mystery, and some very realistic and very erotic sex scenes (for a change). The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music (!) are all wonderful! In short, Basic Instinct is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)! 
 Although J. A. Jance's series of "Joanna Brady" mysteries has been around a while, I was just introduced to them this summer. "Desert Heat" introduces Joanna on her wedding anniversary, when she finds her barely-alive husband shot and left to die in a dry wash near their home. The story is gripping, leading the reader by the nose through a variety of suspicions while never revealing enough to show what is "really going on" until Joanna also discovers it. The characters in the story are a nice collection of small-town figures: sheriff and deputies, the minister, relatives and neighbors. The characters, even Joanna, do not develop greatly during the story; after all, it takes only about three days. But the relationships between the characters develop well, especially between Joanna and her mother. There are some coincidences in the story which strain credulity, and it felt as though Jance rushed the ending to keep the book to manageable size. Then again, I was so taken with the story that I rushed to get to the ending, needing to know that folks would be all right! I look forward to reading the rest of the series. 
 So why have I watched it ten times? Why do I keep replaying the song clips and interviews? Why do some of the lines he muttered keep running through my head like a continuous loop? Why is Ralph Emory such a clueless twit? Guess you'll have to buy it if you want the answers 
 E-40 is a rapper that is an acquired taste that everyone can't get into. His style is different and along with his slanguage, accent, and Bay Area beats, it makes him hard to get into.  Nonetheless, E-40 has maintained a stellar career with a few platinum albums and scoring some major hits that hip hop fans recognize such as Players Ball, Sprinkle Me, and Captain Save A Hoe as well as creating slang (nizzle, sheezy etc. etc.)  He's collaborated with legends like Too Short and 2Pac as well as others such as UGK, Mystikal, Lil Jon, Eightball & MJG and others.  On his new album MY GHETTO REPORT CARD, he introduces the new movement along the west coast called HYPHY.  He gets high class collaborations from the likes of Juelz Santana, Bun B, Eightball, Too Short, Mike Jones, and TPain as well as bringing some of his homies along such as Bosko, Keak Da Sneak, and The Federation.  None of his homies really standout but they aren't terrible either.  The album is a mixed bag in my opinion.  The songs have to grow on you and some of the hyphy beats are weird sounding but I guess they do bring out the hip hop culture that is the Bay Area (never known for a traditional style anyway).  So in that aspect, E40 succeeds.  He manages to have some crossover appeal with his first two singles Tell Me When To Go and U And Dat which are both certified bangers.  Other songs are good too such as Yay Area, Muscle Cars, She Say She Love Me, Gimme Head, Go Hard Or Go Home, White Girl, Happy To Be Here and I'm Da Man and Yee.  I think YEE is the best song on the album along with U And Dat.  My Ghetto Report Card has it's high points of greatness and then it has it's clear lows bordering unlistenable ( Gouda, They Might Be Taping, Do Ya Head Like This, Block Boi, skits) and it makes for an uneven listen, but he has enough good songs to keep the listener coming back for more.  4 stars. 
 Even though you know what's going to happen to Tom Selleck's character, and you know that the ending will be happy, watching the process is enjoyably discomfiting.  This is a plot film -- stuff keeps happening to the main character, things he appears utterly incapable of controlling, and everything spirals right into disaster.  Great Friday night fare.  Make a lot of popcorn and savor it 
 Overall a good study of the last great westward folk migration in American history. I would add that many of their predecessors in the "classic" frontier period were just as broke and hungry as these migrants, but there was little mass media around to record them.  An interesting, well-done slice of folk Americana 
 I bought this as a gift & was pleased as I read it, before wrapping it up.  Shows pics of breastfeeding, baby-sling wearing, Dad helping-out. Great book! I'll give this to Big-Sibling at the same time as I give the new baby gift. 
 I'm naming one of my children Laird; what a stud, eah?  A friend had this large surfer pictorial coffee table book back in 97, and 10 years later it's still the best book I've ever seen on the subject.  It has some of the finest photographs ever taken of large wave surfing (the cover is not just a one-off) and some of the preeminent accompanying text that ever existed about surfing (heartfelt philo; but intelligent, not loadie).  Other than Surfer magazine, I believe this book was the first to show the new era of tow-in surfing, and the story of the heroes who created it.  It's complete - and the first edition is no doubt a collectors piece for surfers.  To my mind the movie Riding Giants should have clearly stated "inspired by the book Jaws Maui", because it's essentially the same thing in a different medium (and also highly recommended).  There is this marvelous line in the book - one of the hardcore crew basically answering the question about why Laird is so much better than anyone else.  His answer was stellar; something along the lines of ~yeah - he's insane - "he's doing this for entirely different reasons".  Absolutely classic.  Absolutely frickin' classic.  I'm just now getting the book (or I'd give you the exact quote) but what a glorious and magnificent line.  I was devastated when it didn't make it into the movie Riding Giants. 
 I couldn't put the book down when I first bought it.  Here it is months later and I've read it again.  The story is great!  I do wish that Nora Roberts would have continued the story maybe into a trilogy.  I would like to know more about what happens to Sophia and Ty.  Also Pillar and David-----  I highly recommend this book.  Its definitely one of her BEST 
 I love this book. It explain how to make pasta from scatch and how to make many differt flavor of pasta. I got a pasta machine for Christmas and these recipes work great for my pasta machin 
 Just read "The Golden Key" for the first time. As soon as I finished, I read it for a second time. And now I will admit, this is the first George MacDonald book I've ever read. If all his work is as good as this enchanting story, I'm hooked on MacDonald.     Reminded me a bit of a fanciful version of "Pilgrim's Progress". The images, story and characters are simply gorgeous. I'm sure each time I read it, I will discover more of the allegorical symbolism, but I could care less about "figuring it all out". It's such a deep, imaginative story--that builds and builds and does not disappoint. : 
 Very visual book, excellant ideas.  Hope to use it to help my kids in school 
 Sure it took three of us hours to put it together. We got a lot of other knight sets too though. Sure if you sit on it or throw it against a wall it will come apart (as would most any Playmobil set). That's the point with playmobile, there are lots and lots of pieces. That's what makes it so great and fun. This castle has tremendous replay value and I highly recommend it 
 I liked this book so much I ordered the movie. It reads well, however it is a bit contrived so many events would be unlikely to happen.  Character development is realistic.  Overall this is about as good as it gets for pleasure reading! 
 Since I came to NYC, I've read two truly hilarious novels - The Russian Debutante's Handbook (that's Shteyngart) and The Mating Season (which would be Woodhouse).  I put Home Land among em.  Jokes on every page, high concept - what if someone wrote their high school alumni notes ... and told the truth?  I loved it.  And I loved that it was relentlessly suburban, building to the magic of the 15 year reunion, while it told of the travails of Lewis Miner, high school loser cum adult loser, with the biting sarcasm and gimlet eye of the dispossessed.  I don't review books without ripping them a little, even if I love them.  So what's wrong with the so-right Home Land (other than the boring title)? - the secondary characters get lots of good lines, but sound a lot a like - Principal Fontana, Gary the drug addict, and Lewis's dad all sound pretty alike.  Read for the jokes, not the richness of the periphery - the lost love who consumed Lewis's 20s was a little random.  Why was she a quasi-movie star?  Why did he go to Manhattan to deal with her?  I thought the plot was good, in the lots of interesting sketches building suspense and leading to a great last line.  But not every sketch made sense. - weird change from Lewis being a Pale Fire like unreliable narrator to a more faithful recorder of events.  Did the one form just poop out?  These are minor quibbles, in what, I would have to say, is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I'll be pressing it on my friends eagerly.  And the paperback price is so, so right.  
 I just read Ellsberg's memoir of his years in the Pentagon and his decision to release and publicize the Pentagon Papers with the public. It was a revelation. I was shocked and saddened by how close the period he writes about mirrors the insanity we now endure. He makes painfully clear that not only does government regularly lie but that it it is incapable of not lying 
 By applying his 7 principals of attitudinal healing you can retrain your  mind to replace negative attitudes one at a time with love. He explains  that we can be happy and at peace regardless of external circumstances. Dr.  Jampolsky has a center for healing in CA, and includes in the book some of  his patients' experiences with attitudinal healing 
 Most of the information is common sense, so common that in business we forget to do these simple but vital things. The book is required reading for our employees. 
 This book was compact and well documented with wonderful quotes, stories and pictures.  I felt privileged to have been allowed to share the deep thoughts and very personal reflections of a man who has had a vast impact in the very challenging world of modern pistolcraft and riflery. You will find yourself very quickly turning the last page of the book, looking forward to yet another page of Col Cooper's wisdom and wit.  I currently have next on my booklist, "To Ride, Shoot Straight, And Speak The Truth" by Col. Cooper.  His books on modern pistolcraft and riflery are truly the Standard by which all others in this genre are judged 
 He leído varios libros de autores españoles recientemente. Y La Reina del Sur y La Sombra del Viento, sobresalen por la mezcla de creatividad literaria y entretenimiento que muchos lectores buscan y que los autores han sabido magistralmente imprimir en sendas obras. Si lo que quiere es un libro de aventuras bien planeadas, en locales exóticos y comunes, con una exquisita visión literaria que no sacrifica en nada la continuidad de la lectura, con pasajes cinematográficos difícil de olvidar en el idioma español, La Reina del Sur es, por mucho, ejemplo de la literatura que sin dejar de serlo, atrae a quienes gustan de la ficción popular. Un logro extraordinario por un autor consagrado.  
 Bold and transcendent movie that literally broke the walls of a delicate, awful and overlooked issue, that day after day corrodes the entrails of the modern societies all over the world.    Tense drama that will shock you from the first shot. The trilogy conformed by this picture, Requiem for a dream, and more recently, Mary full of grace are not a mere product of casualty.   Powerful, merciless, cruel and struggling script that will beat in the family of a devoted ferocious prosecutor who combats this awful lash.  Filmed in sepia tonality to accent still more the dramatis personae. Special mention to Benicio del Toro for this celebrated performance.  
 This book is the coolest book I have ever read, it is exciting,funny. If you like cats you will love this book. Little minds will love it 
 Poet Kim Chernin wrote the memoir "In My Mother's House" because her mother asked her to, and the book began with her mother's proposal. It took seven years for her to finish writing. The book uses a structure of alternative chapters: one in the present time, in a family setting, with the mother starting to tell a story, and the author expressing her emotions toward her mother and the writing experience; the next from her mother's POV, telling a personal story interwoven with a piece of the American Communist history before and during the McCarthy period. The mother's stories hold my interest throughout, as she was so genuinely enthusiastic about being an organizer of Communist activities, even though it meant she had to go to jail and face deportation. When she lived in the Soviet Union during 1932-34 before WWII, she found that country the realization of her idealistic dream and she loved her life there wholeheartedly. Her experience in America during the McCarthy period, on the other hand, illustrates how cruel and unjust a so-called democratic government can become when it operates on belief instead of the constitution. All this is so controversial. I kept wanting to know what the mother would think after Stalin's crimes were exposed later. It turns out the mother was never disillusioned while the daughter eventually was during her own visit to Moscow in the 1970s. It is the personal accounts of a controversial history that fascinates me, while I'm not sure how much the structure of alternative chapters helped. I think the mother's POV helped a lot, as her voice is quite distinctive from the author's and this made the mother's stories more vivid. I found the author's chapters in between her mother's storytelling somewhat uninteresting with the presentation of her own emotions too repetitive, to the point it got boring. Overall, one flaw cannot mar the jade, "In My Mother's House" was a great read 
 This has to be one of my all time favorites, along with "An Affair to Remember" and "The Notebook."  Richard Gere is fantastic in this role and as you listen to the commentary on the making of the movie you realize how seriously he took the role.  He practiced many hours in order for things to look professional and that translates into superb dancing technique. Stanley Tucci is a hoot in this movie and he as well did a great job dancing. Jennifer Lopez was so interesting to watch and as her character evolved she too transformed in front of our eyes.  Susan Sarandon did an excellent job playing the wife of Richard Gere.   All in all this was entertaining from beginning to end.  The music was inspiring and the ballroom scenes with the quick step and the waltz were my favorites. If you enjoyed watching "Dancing With the Stars", you'll love this movie! 
 To what extent a person loses his individual identity is the major focus of this long-winded but rewarding novel.  While not the author's best work it nonetheless illustrates what types of people exist in the world, and what people, in moments of thoughtlessness, can do to each other 
 Zoom is a well done book about perspective.  The outcome will leave you smiling or scratching your head.  It is definitely a book worth having.  I bought one for all my children's families and some of my closest friends.  It is classic 
 BORN IN ICE is the 2nd part of the Born In Trilogy -- This trilogy is about three sisters - two who know each other and one who is unknown. The sisters are so different, at times it's hard to image them coming from the same family.   BORN IN ICE is the story of Brianna Concannon. Brianna has chosen to keep her family home and turn it into a bed and breakfast. During the harsh Irish winter, a long-term guest arrives that heats up even the coldest of nights. Grayson Thane, famous mystery writer, falls hard and fast for the quiet Brianna. And Brianna falls for Grayson, wondering if it will only last through the winter or a lifetime.   This trilogy shows Roberts' cleaver characters, witty interactions, and vast descriptions of the Irish country that she seems to love so well. You couldn't ask for 3 better books! You have Fire (temper), Ice (patience) and Shame (out-of-wedlock child) that meld together to create a marvelous Irish tale. Come meet the daughters of Thomas Concannon, and see why Nora Roberts is one of the greatest romance writers of all time!   I strongly recommend that you have all three books in your possession, because as soon as you finish one, you'll want to start the next immediately! 
 Great movie 
 I am delighted with the Kingston Compactflash Card Ultimate. However,I ordered the 133X version from J & R Music/Computer World which was shown on their website, but received a 100X.  It wasn't worth sending it back or making an issue of it, but I was unhappy that I didn't get what I ordered 
 G.Dep's debut album "Child of the Ghetto" (2001) was a nice release. Guest appearances come from Deps Bad Boy family: P.Diddy, Black Rob, Loon, Carl Thomas, Shyne, Joe Hooker, and Mark Curry and two more notable appearances come from rap legends Rakim & Kool G Rap. This record only has one major blemish, that being that Sean Combs (P.Diddy) took three tracks that appear on this and released them on "The Saga Continues" prior to this album thus taking away from it a bit. After intro G.Dep starts things off strong with "Everyday" which is about a regular day in his life, hustling to make cash. Next comes the title track "Child of the Ghetto" a memorable andrenaline laced banger. The lead single "Special Delivery" comes next, this one never really caught my attention like other tracks on this release. Some decent collabrations follow like Shyne and G.Dep on "Keep it Gangsta" and "I Am" feat. Kool G Rap & Rakim. G.Dep rips an oldschool beat on "Doe Fiend". My favourite track is "I Want the World to See" feat. Joe Hooker an excellent collabration which is backed by a sick beat. Next comes another commercial single that blew up, the decent three way collabration of Black Rob, Diddy and G.Dep on "Let's Get It". "It's All Over" feat. R&B singer Carl Thomas is another good cut. The albums closer "Nothing Gonna Stop Me" is a memorable lengthy track at almost 10 minutes, a track where G.Dep talks about making it the game. I like the beats on this album and G.Deps on point lyrics. I am hoping that Black Rob, G.Dep, Shyne (when he gets out) will be getting out some more albums, but as the years pass and Bad Boy promotes new artists IE Loon, Da Band I wonder if there will be second albums or if Bad Boy will continue to move on to new artists. Anyway around I recommend checking out "Child of The Ghetto" 
 This is my second book by this author.  She is wonderful in my opinion.  This book has fabulous recipes that are easy to follow, and color photographs that make you salivate (assuming you like Indian cuisine).  As a vegetarian, I am always looking for new ways to prepare veggies.  I highly recommend the 'vegetarian bunny chow' in this book, and the 'curried carrots'. I wish I could meet Ms. Jaffrey.  Enjoy!  
 Good book. Lots of small stroies in it my Laurall K Hamilton. Lots of stories that are from before she made it big 
 As a professor of literature, I love this little book.  I've been teaching the 20th-century novel for a few years, and I've never come across something that so clearly makes the connections for both myself and my students.  This amazingly compact work is comprehensive and horribly philosophical, and yet it presents the connections in a very approachable way:  I would highly recommend it for both teachers and students.  (Indispensible for graduate studies in English. 
 The Random Walk was a tremendous help in figuring out what to do as I take over my portfolio from my former paid investment advisor. What is perhaps most helpful is that many of the answers provided in the book are simple and straightforward solutions to complex issues. I enter retirement much more confident of how to manage my resources effectively while avoiding many of the financial errors I've made in the past 
 Rudolf Carnap is the one of the most famous analytic philosophers of 20th Century and he is one of the leaders of Vienna Circle. Learning Symbolic Logic from this classical book would be enthusiasti 
 It took a while for me to buy this cd, but just kept hearing more and more songs from this cd on the radio and they were all great!  My faves are "Se esfuma tu amor" and "valio la pena", but must say...this is probably Marc's best salsa release 
 I don't mean this to be snarky at all, but I recently decided that I wanted to watch HOWARDS END again--only to discover that I was actually watching it for the FIRST time!  I must have been thinking of REMAINS OF THE DAY--or maybe I just wasn't thinking.  Does that say more about me than it does about Merchant and Ivory?  Is it really true that if you've seen one M&I production, you've seen 'em all?  Or am I just having another one of my cinematic senior moments?  Well, I'll own up to it: these are my problems, not the film's.  There are, of course, a number of people who hate Merchant and Ivory productions and just about any other period film.  I am not one of them.  I found that I did like HOWARDS END very much indeed, and no, I cannot recall actively disliking any M&I effort that I've seen.  Yes, the films are veddy British, and for some American viewers that equates to faw-faw-faw stuffiness.  They're wrong, of course.  A film like HOWARDS END is as more a critique of the stultifying British class system than a Valentine to Britannia.  Or maybe it's both.    HOWARDS END can seem almost as much a set-piece as a period piece in that it offers the viewer a schematic portrait of Edwardian society.  You have three families each representing a particular social class (the upper class Wilcoxes, the middle class Schlegels, and the working class Basts).  In less careful hands, it could come off as almost too calculated, especially so since it is the middle class family which effectively "mediates" between the others.  That is to say, the Schlegels mediate between their social betters and inferiors "IN EFFECT," since their attempts to negotiate class distinctions circa 1910 are anything but "EFFECTIVE."  Their attempts are in fact disastrous and lead to tragic consequences for all (although--ironically--the brunt of the tragedy is felt by the upper class Wilcoxes and the lower class Basts: while the middle class Schlegels seem to emerge from all the bad business around them, well, if not unscathed, then at least with their principles and humanity--and lives--still intact.  The film is a surprisingly subtle and effective social critique made all the moreso by its insightful and humane portraits of all its characters.  Not surprisingly, these are no mere stick-figure social stereotypes.  We see all too well how entrenched class distinctions can be pernicious and debilitating for some--and limiting for all.  But even the film's most boorishly snooty character has his endearing traits,  and the wealthy clan's pater familias is almost tragic in his isolation and emotionally cramped state.  All of this complexity requires spot-on acting, and thankfully, the film is perfectly--almost ingeniously--cast.  In fact, were it a gaudier spectacle, you might even be tempted to view the casting of political firebrand Vanessa Redgrave as a conservative upper class matron (who is "only too thankful not to have the vote") as a kind of stunt casting.  As it is, you have to at least see it as a delicious irony.  And it's so nice to see Antony Hopkins play a complex, conflicted (but non-psychotic) character.  It has oft been asserted that he and Emma Thompson work brilliantly together--and that's true.  It's no wonder that they were set for a re-match in REMAINS OF THE DAY (portraying--interestingly enough--more "upstairs" roles than the decidedly "downstairs" ones they have here: of course, these skilled actors pull off both masterfully).  Speaking of being a firebrand, I suspect that for many younger viewers, particularly non-Britons, the perceived reservedness of Merchant and Ivory films and their muted social criticism, will not be not enough.  HOWARDS END is a deft critique of English class structure, but it's hardly a call to revolution.  In the end, it is more of a character study than a tract--which makes its small scale tragedies all the more human (and in the modern sense) all the more tragic.  One comes away from the film with the realization that the social order necessary to maintain civilization has also inevitably set up barriers between individual human beings. And therein lies much of the tragic nature of we like to refer to as the human condition 
 Solnit has some interesting things to say about Muybridge's photography, and about how photography, our self image as a society, and even California's culture of rebirth, innovation, and redemption are tied up. But even apart from such heady stuff, Muybridge was a rascal who lived an interesting life (besides his photography, he murdered his wife's lover and invented the technology that is the basis for movies). So read this book, you'll enjoy it, and maybe learn a bit too 
 Short story?  I loved this movie.  Long story? I was forced to come upstairs and write a review because my husband grew weary of of hearing me exclaim, "I loved this movie!"  Where to start?  I adored the cinematography, the writing, the directing, the acting, the costuming - so, really?  Everything.  I loved everything.  Beautifully and poignantly, Coppola told the story of Marie Antoinette, and for the first time - to me anyway -  made her entirely real and sympathetic.  I never before knew her to be anything but the "let them eat cake" lady and Coppola completely changed my perceptions.  Setting the story against a modern soundtrack was nothing short of brilliant and worked in the same way the soundtrack enhanced Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliette.  The soulful stylings of New Order, Adan Ant, and Siouxsie and the Banshees, among others, added volumes to what was already a powerful story.  The bottom line is Sophia Coppola made Marie Antoinette so real that I had to comment.  And if Sophia wants me to take the names of everyone who booed at Cannes, she only need say the word.

 this cd really brought out the best songs from the best scenes in the movie. if you enjoyed the film bottle rocket, i suggest you buy this cd because it will make you appreciate the good music. i, being a true bottle  rocket and wes anderson fan, see this cd as a gem 
 I took several courses under a reknowned Islamic scholar (who is a practicing Muslim, mind you) and gave serious consideration to conversion to Islam.  I digested all I could about Islam and as many translations of the Quran as I could get my hands on.  While I never made the leap, I found a continuing deep level of respect for the faith of Islam and all Muslims, from the humanist variety to the militant variety so in the news these days.  That being said, of all the courses I took, it is perhaps the course I took on Politics and Islam that continues to stick with me.  For example, many in the West have a certain view of Khomeini as a renegade terrorist.  What people don't understand is how it is that he was (and perhaps still is, to a degree) so revered.  Having taken the course, I have a different understanding of his significance and how it was that he rose to power.  I also understand more deeply why it is that the West (and the United States, in particular) is so feared, even hated by so many in the Middle East.  This book helped along that path.   The big names are here.  If you wish to understand modern day Islam as a political force, you need to know some of the names in this book: al-Afghani, Abduh, Khomeini and Qutb and others are those whose thoughts gave rise to such movements as the Muslim Brotherhood and the Jama't-e-Islami.  The militant strain that is so prevalent did not appear out of a vacuum.  The roots were already planted.  While it is claimed that the roots of the violence we see today go back to Muhammad, we underestimate just how much these modern thinkers and their interpretations of the Quran have influenced the course of modern day events.    While the book is not without its weaknesses, it is a great introduction to understanding this phenomenon.  While it is so contrary to Western culture, when understood in proper context, it is not so strange as we may think.  While you may not agree with their conclusions and courses of action, you may at least understand better where they are coming from. 
 This book is a very heavy theological book (in concept), while remaining a light read.  Rauschenbusch does a masterful job of commencing a discussion of what it means to be an active Christian in the world we find ourselves.  This means never turning a blind eye to the manifest social evils of our society.    Therefore, as Christian we must reconsider what it means to be Christian outside of Christendom, realizing that we are part of a broken world of hurt and anguish.    Chief among the social problems is poverty, and Rauschenbusch seeks to explicitly name this problem and then call and mobilize the church to be the chief combatants of this problem.  Rauschenbusch is particularly qualified to write this book because of his solid theological background/expertise (He became a thologican at Rochester Seminary) and saw the social evils he seeks to combat as pastor in Manhattan's "Hell's Kitchen" in the early 20th century.  Finally, it must be stated that this book is an important read for Christians for two reasons: (1) it is academic enough that it was assigned in a Master's Level course that I took and (2) the rhetoric is light enough that anyone that is prepared to love their neighbor in a profound and transforming way could be profoundly affected by the content in these pages 
 Bill's love for Canada and his passion for camping in the wild come through gloriously in this loving look at outdoor tripping and living. It's chock full of tips and stories and quite honestly is my favourite camping and canoeing book by far 
 [1] It is a classical book written by an excellent mathematician, not a worker of statistics! [2] Its mathematics is precise and fascinating. [3] The philosophy of Bayesian statistics is well discussed. [4] It's worthy to read it many times. [5] At the time of its publication, the revolutionary computational statistics was still in gestation. So, it is unfair to criticize its lack of numerical simulation, etc. As a comlement, some pragmatistic books are recommended, such as J. Liu's book on MCMC methods, Tanner's Tools for Statistical Inference, etc 
 I bought the book for a gift but ended up reading it myself. It is a great book with lots of information in it. There are also some fine receipes. Albert Bates is an author who has researched his information carefully and he presents it in an easy to understand manner. I would recommend this book to everybody. 
 OK, this definitley wasn't one of Nas's greater albums, as a matter a fact it was his worst. But I think everyone can agree when I say though it wasn't his best it's still better than most of these stuff the rappers come out with now. Rappers like Yung Joc, Paull Wall, Mike Jones, Lil foneo and all the rest of those little corny rappers. 
 We purchased this pepper mill for ourselves. We like it so well, that we are ordering five more for gifts for our kids and friends. We have four other pepper mills and none of them compare to this one 
 Nothing at all like boy-band CDs (InSync, Backstreet Boys, etc like editorial compared it to).  While some of the songs are over-processed and don't allow Clay's strong, clear, and beautiful voice to shine through enough, it is overall a very good CD. It has some catchy tunes on it.  His second CD, Merry Christmas With Love, allows his wonderful voice to shine through even more 
 This book was such a gift to read.  It gave me such freedom in my spiritual journey.  I always thought that I wasen't spiritual because I couldn't concentrate when I was reading the bible or I didn't have a special "time" when I read the bible.  Understanding my personality and how God has made me helped me to realize that I'm fine just the way I am and God loves me no matter what!!!  Thank you Marita for writing such an incredible book.  
 This is a must for any George Strait fan. It contains pehaps too many of his classics, including "Baby Blue," "The Cowboy Rides Away," "It Ain't Cool to be Crazy about You," and "You Look So Good in Love." This is a great set, and it has to be listened to many times to get the full effect. You won't mind because the songs are so good, with the selection being nothing less than perfect. Go George 
 This story is one that is sure to achieve the "droopy eyes" effect on your youngster as a bedtime story.  It takes you on a trip through the jungle meeting all the animals and it ends with an interesting moral lesson about gossiping!  Anyone who has played that game "telephone" will agree that a story can change immensely as it is passed from ear to ear.  We learn the fate of the mosquito and why he is the way he is in this masterfully weaved folk tale replete with colorful pictures.  I recommend this one for the child's shelf!! 
 Without doubt one of the best books ever written.  West succeeds in building characters who are real and also touches on relevant spiritual issues.  Morris West must be one of the 20th century's greatest writers. This book is a "must read 
 There are not enough adjectives for the tremendous impact of this recording - all it takes is one play - one memory - cascades!   These ladies are to "Die For" 
 Take away the reputation and infamy you experience when hearing the name "Robert Downey, Jr."  Listen carefully and you will find a genuine talent, a man who can sing and write music suitable to his own musical range and interests.  Over time, I think we can expect a richer catalog to come from Downey; his greatest potential limitation is a loss of faith in his ability to control his own demons. Downey has a earthy voice that melds with his choice of jazz-influenced songs.  He shows what he's got, and does not try to create a pop-rock persona for the sake of selling his music.    
 When this film opened it was a box office disaster because it received a "Condemned" rating from the Catholic church which meant, literally, if you were a Catholic and saw the film, you could not receive the sacraments anymore (now THAT'S a rating system!).  But, of course, the film is more than tame by today's standards (it's rated G). It is a classic bedroom farce and it may have been the inspiration for the 2 songwriters (Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beaty) in Ishtar.  One of the real joys in the film is the music - both Andre Previn's wonderfully heavey-handed score AND the "songs" the two inept amateur songwriters write (all written by George & Ira Gershwin who were asked to write the worst songs they could imagine).  I don't doubt that if the film had been completed with Sellers in the Walston part that it would be a better film, but it is the film that it is and that's the film I find good enought to rank just below Wilder's best work.  The stand out performance here is by Dean Martin.  To suggest that he wasn't aware that he was playing a particularly vicious send up of his lounge lizard persona is insane.  He was obviously enjoying sending himself up enormously in every scene.   As far as films about "successful infidelity" go.... Wilder's other lost gem, "Avanti," with Jack Lemmon and Juliet Mills, is also terrific as it deflates banal middle class 50s values.  If you mostly watch The 700 Club when not watching DVDs, maybe you won't find this to your liking. But then again, perhaps you might want to get a copy, a nice frosty bottle of decent vodka, and loosen the heck up. 
 It's truly sad that, for one thing, Lynne Truss felt the need to write "Talk to the Hand" on the rudeness we've all encountered or, worse, subjected those around us to.  More sad, however, is that I agree with so much of what she has to say (I chuckled right along through most of it).  Of course, in agreeing that the world is a rude place, I feel that I need to put on my "I don't give a damn if people will be upset with me for thinking and saying what's on my mind" mantle and hope that the tomatoes aren't thrown too hard at me.  It's true, manners and the small niceties appear to have gone the way of beehive hairdos and poodle skirts.  We've been made to believe that looking out for ourselves should be our first priority.  Truss is not only correct in including societal obligations in this discussion, but would have done a disservice to her readers and lowered her credibility with this reader had she not--ANYone can [...] about how other people behave... I probably won't go the route of those Random Acts of Kindness people, or follow Truss's own route of speaking out; I'll probably hang back with righteous indignation or want to die of embarrassment for having to hear someone being called on for their rudeness.  "Talk to the Hand" gives me pause, though, makes me rethink some of my own behaviour, and I suppose that's where the genius of this book lies: have your fun reading the rants of someone else, see that she writes the truth, look at your own contributions to the mess, and perhaps clean up a bit of that mess "while [you're]... there...."  
  James Thaddeus Goad is not, in any sense, innocent. He (in reality) singlehandedly produced the "zine" that effectively put paid to the self-referential, pompous,and usually inept zine culture, basically by being so offensive to the status quo that it simply gave up in frustration. He's been a poster boy for dubious judgment, pleading guilty to an offense that anyone else would have went to trial for and won, and served nearly three years. And, yes, he did the deed: he beat the snot out of a female, a mistress who had hit, tormented, and threatened him so badly that he had had a protection order taken out against her (he did, however, continue to have wild sex with her on a daily basis). Goad says-and it's absolutely true-that had he not been a notorious, politically offensive writer, he would probably have received counseling and a small fine for the offense which could have put him away until he was old enough for Social Security.   All through the convoluted and often ugly story which this book tells-and quite competently-Goad realizes he's doing the wrong thing, for the wrong reasons, at the wrong time, and in the wrong place. Yet Goad-who is obviously intelligent, driven, physically fit, and obsessively introspective-seems doomed by his own compulsion to follow a path he realizes is going to cause him serious trouble. And, it does.   Goad winds up in the Oregon correctional system, one of the few in the country where whites are not a minority, and serves his time without any life-threatening incidents: boredom, frustration, and petty annoyances are the order of the day, not shankings and rape. But Goad clearly does not belong in prison, and it's clear-not just to Goad, but to any rational observer-that Goad is far more victim than perpetrator here.   This book, apparently written during Goad's incarceration, is a readable narrative and, for most of us, a reminder that free speech is never really free: alienate the wrong (or right) people enough and if they get the chance to nail you, they will. 
 I've often wondered that if I had to attend a party or a ball that was made up of every character of a particular author's body of work, whose creations would I wish to meet? You couldn't do much better than Charles Dickens, and surely the host of such a gathering would be Mr. Pickwick of the Pickwick Club.  The club, discovered in a collection of "posthumous papers," is something of a toast masters society that journeys from London to the English countryside and back again in search of various forms of stimulation.  Instead of finding that philosophical, poetic, and scientific wisdom that they are in search of, more often they stumble into situations not of their own making. Nearly always, hilarity ensues.  They spirit of the novel is both jolly and tender; never has a book so often made me want to join the action.  And while I haven't read every Dickens novel, I doubt that you will find a more wonderful pair of friends that Samuel Weller and Mr. Pickwick.  The two are genuine and devoted friends, despite their differences in interests, mannerisms, and stations in life.  Regarding the very long novels of the 19th century (this may sound obvious), they take some getting used to, especially to readers of much shorter contemporary novels.  One inevitably will forget a character or a detail that appears on p. 35 as they read p. 700.  Yet, one should remember that the novel came out in 19 monthly installments, and thus does not call for a quick reading.  One can set the book aside for a few days and not worry about losing the plot; there isn't really a plot.  Like a television series today, the adventures involve the same principle characters, with many of the supporting characters reappearing throughout the narrative.  But the work itself is less a story than a canvas, and there is no central conflict or tension.     My first crack at one of Dickens' long novels was David Copperfield, which was also my first review on this site.  I gave it 2 stars, despite the fact that I enjoyed so many pieces of it.  Trying to race through a Dickens novel will end in frustration and exhaustion.  Don't be afraid to read other books simultaneously.   Lastly, do yourself a favor and read the Introductions written by GK Chesterton.  These essays both elevate one's own reading of the novel, and provide pleasure and insight in their own right.  They bypass both the jargon and ostentatious learning that can make contemporary criticism a battle to read. 
 The adventure continued for the "Heroes of the Lance" in this the second installment of The Chronicles Trilogy. The companions, led by Tanis, have led the refugees into the dwarfish kingdom under the mountain. The book opens up after the companions have helped to recover a lost magical hammer. But the companions know that the refugees cannot stay with the dwarves, so they set off to the port of Tarsis to arrange transport to some where more secure. It is here that the adventure truly begins. Soon the companions become separated and discover that in order to succeed they must recover the legendary dragonlance and the mystical dragon orb.  "Dragons of Winter Night" is similar to the "The Two Towers," the second part of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, it is a darker story where the forces of evil are winning before the heroes win a victory to begin the forces of good hope again. For much of "Winter Night"the forces of the evil Dragon armies are on the march - they have managed to force the elves to flee their homelands, separated the companions and were within inches of defeating the knights. By the end of the book the companions have restored some home to the world with their victories and their re-discovery of the Dragonlance. As with the first book of the Trilogy this is a fast paced adventure with well-developed characters. This book marks the first time that the group of main characters becomes separated. In many ways this serves to make the book better. When the companions are together there are too many of them and it makes it difficult to remember every viewpoint. With them separated each viewpoint becomes clearer and more developed. The authors also do a good job of remembering all the major characters and not leaving anyone out. Finally there is a good twist in the last third of the book with Tanis that will leave the reader shaking their heads.   While this book certainly works as a stand alone noverl it makes much more sense to read it as part of the trilogy. As I mentioned before this is certainly a darker book then the first book; but every trilogy needs to have a middle book. This also a much sadder book then the first - one of the main characters dies in this book (and I'm not telling which one). It is still an adventure that you can sink you teeth into and a good read.  
 Wendell Berry patiently keeps showing us how to regain the sanity and goodness that life once held. Here are six essays: Farming and the Global  Economy; Conserving Community; Conserving Forest Communities; Private  Property and the Common Wealth; The Conservation of Nature and the  Preservation of Humanity; Health is Membership. In Conserving Community,  Berry lists 17 specific guidelines for regaining our lives by rebuilding  our communities. They alone are worth far more than the price of the  book--if we use them. Berry keeps turning the crank; we need to start the  engine 
 You won't be the same after watching this amazing well done documentary.  There are moments that will move you to tears.  It's a declaration that Black American history IS AMERICAN HISTORY!  How can an American go through life not knowing so many famous names like Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth, you don't get more American than that.  EXCELLENT, a must buy 
 Mitch Duneier's ethnographer about the life of street vendors on Sixth Avenue was compelling and myth-shattering. Some of the misconceptions about the men of Sixth Avenue are disspelled and retold through their words. I was established impressed with the afterword by one of the most interesting street vendors from the ethnography. The book came higly recommended, and I would definitely recommend it to any and everyone 
 This microphone works just fine for me.  I use it with TeamSpeak, and though I do have to be pretty close to it, I and the people hearing me have no complaints 
 This book was a good way for my youngest two boys to pass the time when we had to wait in long lines.  They enjoyed reading about the hidden Mickeys at each park and then trying to find them.  Hidden Mickeys are everywhere 
 BY itself it is a great SF movie and still worth watching today 
 This book was one of the best books I have ever read for what I went through. My mother past and I was very unsettled about  her passing. Of course having all the questions everyone else wants to know. Did they make it what now are they happy. This book was perfect for helping me accept my mothers passing and making me feel closure knowing how happy my mother is now in heaven. Knowing she will be doing things that she only dreamed about and watching over us all. Knowing she can see it all instead of wondering if she knew anything.   The best book I have ever read that helped me in my life and spirit.  I enjoyed every moment of that book that I passed it onto someone else who just lost a loved one. And it helped them as well.   Thank you Sylvia for your books 
 If you were ever interested in why the rich get richer and the poor and middle class struggle; see chapter 3, lesson 2. It is two years of college accounting in a few pages of easy to understand language and diagrams. It challenges the reader to consider what is actually an asset and a liability. This is what separates the classes. The major points of this book are presented in diagrams and this was critical to us, because, like most people, much of our family can't make sense of numbers and time. Just like the author, we learned from our educated parents what to NOT do financially, because what we learned was what worked in the 1950's and 1960's. It doesn't work now and we needed to relearn, beginning with the basics found in this book. 
 This set is easily one of the most definitive mixes I've ever heard.  First off, you have two of the best DJs out there: Sasha and John Digweed.  Sasha's mix (CD1) is good, but it lacks the smoothness of Digweed's set (CD2).  I've never gotten into Sasha's set (I still enjoy it, but not a huge fan).  Digweed's mix is simply amazing.  I love the transitions between songs and the CD has these great waves of beats from dark and gritty to smooth and sexy.  It is a great mix to listen to late a night when you're tired and the hypnotic rhythms put you in a head bobbing mood.  Digweed keeps building and building until you can't take it any more, which is why Gamelan and Enjoy the Silence are my two favorite points in Digweed's set.  Both Sasha and Digweed have made a hit that is both a classic and legendary.    
 I tend to read so many self help books but never do the exercises. I read this incredible book once through, tried the exercises and then put the book down when I realized it was going to be tough. I recently picked it up  again because I felt that it contained so many important things in it that  would provide me with the tools I needed to succeed. I think you may very  likely find that just beginning the process of reading and doing the  exercises in the book will empower you 
 Don't complete your reading too fast with this article. Take a break from time to time, for reflection within you now and then. You may discover something meaningful, which existed, yet faded away with your busy life 
 Make sure its the current version, copyright 2004. It has the best knowledge tester. Take it again and again till you get 1000 points. I'm not kidding. The other books are a waste of money and only endow the author with undue kudo's. I have all of them. They do not reflect the test I took and failed because I relied on these authors. Get the offical guide. Go to the site and get with a study group so you can ask "Senerio" questions. I would not take this test unless you have at least 4-5 years experience in a broad range of domains. Nothing in the world will prep you for this test. Boot-camps included. Stick with the official guide. And pray you don't get the test I did 
 THRESHOLDS OF THE MIND is a work of genius. I urge everyone to read, use, and benefit from Bill Harris's magnificent breakthrough. Harris shows how the pioneering work of Nobel winner Illya Prigogine can be applied at the personal level to vastly increase mental and emotional resiliency 
 Rise of a Merchant Prince by Raymond Feist is the second book in the Serpent War Saga, the first book being shadow of a Dark Queen. This book seems to polarize fans of Feist, as they either love it or abhor it. Me, I really enjoyed this novel for several reasons. 1) It is a deviation from standard fantasy novels in that it doesn't focus on things that are `out of this world so to speak 2) the character development (mainly Roo's) is second to none, and 3) Feist can pen a tale with the best fantasy writers in the business today. With that said, there are a few things that I Wasn't overly fond of, but I will touch on those later in this review.  The main plot of this book is just as the title implies, which is the rise of a merchant prince who is Roo or Rupert Avery. There are a few sub-plots to continue the over-riding story of the saga as well, such as the Serpent's continuing domination of their continent and how that is being dealt with by the main characters Erik and the rest of the army. When I firs found out the plot centered on Roo and dealt a lot with being a merchant and trading etc, I was a little apprehensive as it didn't seem like all that interesting of a book to read. Yet, Feist MAKES it interesting. I have read some reviews on-line that say the pacing of this book is slow; but quite honestly, I didn't see that at all. In fact, I thought the book was hard to put down. There is just enough written about Erik and the army to move that story along, but this book is clearly written for Roo and the emergence he makes as a merchant and how powerful he becomes. With that said one of my complaints is it seemed almost to easy for Roo to advance as he does, but for fear of writing spoilers I won't say more.  As I mentioned above the character development of Roo is fantastic. Feist really does a great job at defining Roo and allowing the reader to see just what makes him tick. The character development of the rest of the cast of this saga seems to be lacking a bit in that nothing much new is really introduced for Erik or Calis. It almost seems like Feist was overly concerned with Roo that he may have `misplaced' the development of the other characters a bit. A minor detail, but none-the-less a little bothersome for those who really enjoy character development and the twists it can bring.  Overall, I thought this was a very good book and right on par with what I have become accustomed to when I crack open a Feist book. If you are a fan of Feist, I think you will enjoy this one if you know what to expect. If you are looking at starting to read a new series and are thinking about this series, I would caution you, and suggest you read Magician: Apprentice first and start from the beginning and get the background, you can't go wrong with that book. All in all a solid read and a enjoyable read for a fantasy reader. 
 Lean, taut, and violent, "The Big Combo" is a great example of 1950's film noir and belongs in the same rank as "This Gun For Hire," "The Killers," and "Criss Cross." While it's low budget shows through (which is common for almost any film noir), the dynamic black and white photography will blow you away with its iconic contrasts.   The first name-less Mr. Brown, as embodied by a barely restrained Richard Conte, is a truly despicable villian. The famous torture scene of Cornell Wilde's police detective seems tame by today's standards, but must have been shocking in 1955 upon the film's release. Still, the violence packs a sap-gloved punch, and the dialogue is so hard boiled it cracks.   Look for early screen appearances by tough guy Lee Van Cleef and Earl Holliman as best buddy(?)assassins who are seemingly inseparable. The hospital scene featuring Mr. Brown speaking to Cornel Wilde through Brian Donleavy is a scream. And all that smoke and those shadows...hard not to like this gem. 
 I found this book particular important as it provides a comprehensive view for those Financial Managers try to shifts from score keepers to decision makers 
 Milan Records presents Elmer Bernstein conducting The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with this digitally remastered "Bernard Herrmann Film Scores ", from "CITIZEN KANE" [1942], "THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER" [1942], "THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH" [1956], "PSYCHO" [1959], "THE WRONG MAN" [1957], "VERTIGO" [1958], "NORTH BY NORTHWEST" [1959], "THE BRIDE WORE BLACK" [1967], "FAHRENHEIT 451" [1966], "TAXI DRIVER" [1973]...and the final track is "BERNARD HERRMANN ON FILM MUSIC" [recorded early 1970s]...which clearly states why music is an additional character to any film, without it the film would be incomplete...during the silent film era, the piano player kept the audience tuned into what was happening, whether it was a love scene or danger lurking around every corner.  Herrmann completely mesmerizes us with his themes, blending variations with eloquent and subtle cues...depicting each character in the film, and fine tuned to the story-line ~ he was a genius and knew his craft well...relies heavily on strings, usually with lyrical solos for the winds...absolute in capturing the essence of each scene, musically letting the audience in through his score ~ the result is colors come shining through with wonderful arrangements...many of the classic film scores have become cult favorites among "film-score-buffs" like me and collectors alike.  Each film score is superb and very strong...the balance of the instruments and experimental touches of Bernard Herrmann are all just brilliant ~ working with directors like Welles, Dieterle, Hitchcock, Truffaut and Scorsese all were very conscious of classic film music and and Herrmann's cues really came through...each outing was nothing less than a bravo performance...those who ignored Herrmann during his career, really missed out...cause all the diehard collectors of film music knew he was a WINNER! ~ Bernard Herrmann [1911-1975].

 This machine is simply amazing, we are cranking up ice cream all the time!  Even though it is not meant to be used   i bought it to do a little market test with ice cream in my coffee shop and it is going very well.  It produces batch after batch without a glitch and my customers are satisfied with the quality.  The only drawback i had read about was how noisy it was AND IT IS NOISY.  Could not believe how noisy it is, now i know what the reviewers meant.

 Have been using Turbo Tax for the past 7 or 8 years. When Quicken, in their wisdom, decided to no longer support WIN98 I thought I'd give Taxcut a try.

 I'm taking in their album You Forgot It In People. Call it Indie Rock or Art Rock, whatever... With the exception of the silly intro track -- adding little to nothing to the overall experience -- this is a very solid album. They mix it up from one track to another and include some instrumental tracks. Read on for some favorite tracks:  Outstanding tracks: o  KC Accidental, revolves between an explosive drum beat and mellow echoing guitars (reminds me of Pavement).  o  Almost Crimes is a catchy rock song with a driving beat and solid vocals (and a cool back-up vocal track).  o  Looks Just Like The Sun is a mellow track with some great accoustic guitar and a fitting percussive. 
 This book has been a great sourse of encouragement. I found the writing very readable and the message useful 
 If you're looking for scary music to set the mood for Halloween, then this is exactly what you need.  Don't get those CDs from wal-mart that are 3 bucks or whatever, they sound like teenagers having too much fun with the computer.  Anything by Midnight Syndicate is 100% professional, and the bestest, scariest, ambient horrific music.  It's so good, I listen to it year round.  My sister is a teacher and plays it all October long anytime the kids are doing an assignment or during a blank moment.  It's scary, but not demonic.  I love Halloween, but I don't think demonic voices make the best atmosphere.  "Haunted Nursery" happens to be my favorite, "Something Wicked", "Darkness Descends", and "Masque of Sorrow" are also brilliant.    I really like this album by Midnight Syndicate, but anything by them is really good.  Each one is differently themed, so it might be fun to buy all of them and put them on shuffle.  Gates of Delirium is Insane Asylum themed, and Vampyre: Symphonies from the Crypt is almost romantic, in an errie way, of course.  
 this book is not an easy read. it is full of information that provokes and ravages "comfort levels" that allow us to mindlessly tolerate the deep cruelty that goes on will not be ideas most people will want to entertain, but allowing oneself to entertain the idea that this sort of cruelty exploitation and violence can and does exist, if not in your day to day experience, somewhere in the world, should be enough to cause any person who still retains a morself of humanity outrage. As humans we have the ability to transcend survival of the fittest and exploiting the "weaker" for the needs of the stronger in our own human family, and this book removes the gauze from any eyes that may be confused about just how brutal life can be in the body of a woman in times and places where being such is not genuinely honored. This book IS like a  slap to the face, and upon first reading it can cause discomfort, but like a slap to someone in a daze, it's also sobering in it's unabashed straightforward call-it-as-it-is style. It makes  you realize how often communication especially by women is modified to be innocuous and palatable to the reader. At the very least this book is refreshing in that it is as far from that as it gets, but it's much more. It is important to the evolution of a society to name the subtle and flagrant violence and humiliation that is inflicted on some to keep others in power. This book does that. To call things as they are and point to how society is structured around a certain segment [namely males] at the expense of another is NOT doing so to demonize that segment but to name what goes on and point out that what society has allowed to be comfortable for men to believe is complicit and fine for women is not actually so. Only through truly knowing women in their own right and authenticity is it possible to have healthy relations between the sexes 
 This book is quite easy to follow for the novice like me.  I've been a huge fan of Tyler ever since watching him on Food Network on the now cancelled Tyler's Ultimate show.  I prepared a meal for a group of my friends that went over so well that everyone still asks me for his recipes.  I made the meatloaf, garlic mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, chocolate cake, and the "wow wow" cocktails.  Everything turned out incredibly wonderful the first try.  The portions are huge which is good if you are making food for a party.  His definition of party is probably around 6-10 people, while I made all that food for only 4 friends.  We had leftovers but everyone was happy about that.  If you plan to prepare the exact menu I did, it may take at least 2-3 hours to prepare everything. I have a small kitchen so that did slow me down.  You can also make the chocolate cake one day ahead and it will still taste great the next day.  I went to a food demonstration hosted by Tyler a few months ago and he is obviously a very nice and friendly man and definitely shows his love for cooking.  The pictures in the book are very nice and this would make a great gift to any food fans.  Wonderful pictures of Tyler in the book are an added bonus 
 My copy of Queen Afua's Heal Thyself has become terribly dog-eared, because it's such an invaluable tool in my daily living. Many ideas for improving many areas of life, from diet, to exercise, aromotherapy and other NATURAL ways to make sure that I don't continue to do so much damage to myself. Thank you, Queen Afua, for a wonderful book 
 "My Fair Lady" is one of the few musicals ever written that will  be remembered years and years from now and for one very simple reason:   every song is a masterpiece!  It's not like the musicals of today that may  have one or even two songs that stand out from the rest as a true work of  art.  This book gives you page after page of pure musical genius!  For all  of you who know and love "My Fair Lady" or for those of you who  are just interested in good music, this book is a must-have 
 I recently read all the stories in this book over a period of a week.  They are arranged in a nice, thematic way, so that similar stories are grouped together.  I was amazed at the breadth of the subject matter of the stories, having previously restricted myself to Wells' speculative short stories such as "The Land Ironclads".  But "The Valley of Spiders" is a spooky story of what apparently are cowboys on a chase, and the first story in the book, "A Slip Under the Microscope", is a realistic story of college students, that shows how little has changed in over 100 years.  In fact, if one thing struck me about all the stories it is how modern they all are;  there were no anachronisms that spoiled any story, though of course you have to put yourself back before airplanes and tanks were invented in "The Argonauts of the Air" and "The Land Ironclads".  Rather than reviewing all the stories individually, I will just say that anyone who enjoys imaginative short stories will surely find much to like here. 
 Not possible to find a better English language reference source than this book. I have used the book in hard copy but prefer it on CD. Quick to find items using CD and a notebook and CD weigh less that the actual manual. The pronunciations that come with the book on CD seem accurate, depending on the area from whence your Chinese comes. Good background data for all point locations and rationale for their use.  Note that when I had a specific question about his work, Peter Deadman was quick to reply and clarify the descrepancy, which had already been addressed in later editions 
 This is an awesome guide to the Prayer Shawl Ministry. I recommend it to every congregation so that people all around the world can create beautiful shawls for those in need.  
 I was given a complimentary copy of this book for purposes of review. I found this cookbook very useful. It offers numerous recipes in every food category, pulling in from most ethnic sources as well as tradition American versions. The level of complexity of the recipes is good; easy enough for a weeknight meal, yet not so unidimensional as a 3-ingredient cookbook.  Time after time, the recipe in this book mirrored my own tried and true version. If you want an encyclopedic range of recipe that will not disappoint you, you should give this book consideration 
 Mariah White thought her and her Colin's marriage was perfect, that is until she catches Colin with another woman for the second time.  This time, Colin and Mariah get divorced, and their daughter, Faith, is stuck in the middle.  Colin agrees to give custody of Faith to Mariah, but soon changes his mind when faith starts talking to God.  Colin thinks that Mariah is hurting Faith, so he decides to take it to court. 	This book is about Mariah's struggle to keep her daughter, and cope with her divorce, and her ex-husband's sudden remarriage.  Mariah knows Faith is seeing God, but she can't get Colin to believe her.  So she has no choice but to fight for custody of Faith. 	This is great book that will not let you put it down until you finish.  It is suspenseful right down to the final verdict.  I would recommend this book to more advanced readers, 16-up.  This book is similar to Jodi Picoult's other books like Plain Truth, My Sister's Keeper, Salem Falls, and The Pact, because it has a law case in each.  This book is heart-warming, and will teach you how to love, and keep faith.      
 Dear Reader,  It is true I was in training to be a film-maker of some portent...Yes, I was properly versed in the International  Film Art scene, Avante-Garde and Film- Noir...I have been exposed to "Potemkin", "400 Hundred Blows", "The Bicycle Thief", "Day for Night", etc... but.......  Again let me indulge you in another one of my film "guilty pleasures"...."Major Payne"...  Yes, it is a remake of 1955, "The Private War Of Major Benson" but it's as opposite as the two Kirks in TOS, "Mirror, Mirror".....  The 1955 movie definetely has a feel of "gosh, golly, and swell".....Although "good" for it's time it generally has the "sickly sweet" feeling thoughout.  "Major Payne" takes a completely 180 degree turn....  That's right, the 1995 Major (Damon Wayans) is not a boisterous, chauvanistic, drunk....  No Siree, Bob!  Major Winifred Benson Payne is  a 100% killing machine...Out of his own platoon he not only captures the head "bad guy" but the bad guy's entire army! When one of his platoon mates is shot in the leg, the  Major has a very "sick" solution to "Getting your mind off a that pain?" This Major is a "human terminator"; Great example is his story telling version of  "The Little Train that Could"...I would go into detail but I won't as the children reading this  may acquire horribly scarred pysche's...  The children in the movie are not the cute, innocent, gum chewers of 1955 but can be equally venomous and dangerous as the Major as seen in their exploits of getting rid of the Major....C'mon what kinda of kid tries to photograph a boy dressed up as a girl pretending to be sleeping with their ROTC instructor....  PRETTY DEMENTED KIDS!!!!  Yes, this movie goes way overboard on the Major's character (live ammo on the training grounds) and the children's character (payola to the local town motorcycle gang leader) but at least it has the guts to come forth and tell us just how hard it is to teach today's kids!!!!!  But, seriously folks, let your hair down and have a good hard laugh....Check out "Major Payne"....  P.S. Seeing the partial parody of "Apocolypse Now" at the beginning well worth seeing this movie!

 I saw the film "Maurice" long before I read the book. As delightful as the movie is, the book is even better, because we are able to get into the thoughts of the characters and the mind-set near the turn of the 20th century. At first, I did not like Forster's writing style; it's almost too economical, occasionally cryptic. Many times the prepositional referent isn't altogether clear, creating unnecessary ambiguity. Moreover, a lot of the jargon is particular to second-decade England, not to current U.S readers. But as the story picks up momentum, the economy of style turns almost poetic, and the linguistic particularities fade, making this novel into a real page-turner.   The story and the characters are highly realistic, even by today's standards (though written in 1914). There's the common issue of the conflict with "coming-out" gay vis-a-vis the desire to be "normal," which as Forster concludes, is essentially one and the same, regardless of nature's impulses. While to be gay is ultimately to be normal, it is not without its social and personal prejudices and misunderstandings, particularly at the time this book was written. Likewise, Forster demonstrates that gay people can (and most often do) lead quite normal, happy, even transforming lives, despite these difficulties. This is what gives the novel its joy.  Above all, this is a typical story of the vicissitudes of love, the only difference being that it involves three men (and several secondary women). One man (Clive), while thoroughly enjoying his same-sex love, ultimately represses it to make himself socially acceptable, politically viable, and personally miserable. Another man (Maurice), initially thinks he has to do likewise, but he cannot suppress the insuppressible, and finally does the inevitable and heeds his nature's call. The third man (Alec) discovers his unique love, and while initially angry that his love isn't immediately reciprocated, comes to love the man who really does love him after all. In many ways, this is the ultimate "homosexual" novel, but in many other ways, it is also the universal romantic novel.  Beyond the obvious love story, Forster weaves in various themes and ideas of the times (that are still with us). For the perspicuity in incorporating these themes and how they relate to being a human being first, and being gay second, Forster makes for a most satisfying reflection and examination of perennial issues. Not only is the single most important emotion, love, addressed in all its complexities, but so are certain theological, psychological, philosophical, business, and political nuances addressed. The whole enterprise is exceptionally satisfying. A novel worth anyone's time 
 This book has inventive, creative, modern, surprising stories with great depth. They often have a mysterious eeriness that hooks the reader from the start and keeps them glued until the finish. Some stories are fantasy or myth, others include a mix of the two with highly plausible reality, and others are highly reality based with a deep emotional cavern that is carefully revealed and explored ...  Here is a small bit of some of these tempting stories ... "The Thing in the Forest" is about two little girls who are sent to a large mansion during World War II, separated from their parents with little explanation. Although from different social backgrounds, they befriend each other. When out playing, they are attracted to a deep dark forest which they attempt to explore. A little girl named "Alys" wants to join them whom they try to dissuade her but she follows them anyway. Whatever happened to Alys ... changeed their lives forever. Read the story to discover how as adults they return to the mansion during an "open house" and unexpectedly meet, reliving the time they explored the forest.   In the story, "Body Art", Dr. Damian Beckett is a gynecologist  whose passion is collecting artwork, some of which he loans to decorate the unit where he works. Also, he is separated from his wife but not divorced. During Christmas time, he selects highly unusual modern artwork to place in the corridors of the gynecology wing. The artist lives locally, a young lady who has a pierced tongue, and also piercings on other parts of her body. The same young lady is hired to catalogue some ancient relics related to child-birth that is kept in a section of the gyn wing, which includes a collection of unborn fetuses kept as specimens in jars of formaldehyde. At some point, she borrows some relics from the collection to create a mysterious "Kali" statue (female Indian goddess) which is displayed in an art exhibit. It happens that Dr. Beckett visits the exhibit and takes a lady friend along. It is fascinating to read about Dr. Beckett's reaction and how the artwork seems to symbolize certain personal life issues with which the artist is struggling. Dr. Beckett and the artist, Daisy Whimple are forever bonded together on certain levels because of this  encounter. All the stories in this "little book" are riveting and thought-provoking. They will alter your viewpoint of reality and what is important in life. Erika Borsos (erikab93) 
 This CD represents a brilliant statement of dark (maybe "sinister") ambient music.  It is deeply moving and oppressively dark.  The synthesis between Lustmord's unrelenting darkness and Rich's powerful movements in mood results in a satisfying experience of the black void in the pit of your consciousness.  I highly recommend Lustmord newly remastered "Heresy" and Rich's "Troubled Resting Place" for those who enjoy the kinds of moods evoked on this CD 
 I received this very quickly. I couldn't believe I could get the actual namebrand at such a great price. Very pleased 
 A really fun, well orgainized book. My 6 and 9 year olds loved it and so did I (Mom). We have been back to it many times, looking at particular sections. I am now ordering other titles in the series 
 I will cry at anything it seems, My Girl & Armageddon floor me everytime, and I sometimes even cry at Neighbours. So I just knew by reading the blurb of this, that I would cry.  It's amazing these days that a friendship can span three decades - so far my longest friendship has lasted nearly 10 years. And we've been through a lot, but never had a serious argument. As the old saying goes, guys, jobs, etc come & go, but friendships last forever.  In this, the friendship starts at the age of roughly 11, and the young actresses who play Barbara Hershey & Bette Midler's characters are excellent. The little actress who plays CeCe Bloom at 11 is the spitting image of Bette Midler - poor child! She's got the hair, the wide smile and the mannerisms down pat, and it's so funny to watch her. It's a shame Mayim Bialik hasn't done much else, it's mainly voice work she does now (most notably she voices a character in Extreme Ghostbusters.) They become penpals, and the relationship is played out through letters, until they finally get together. The film spirals from there, from husbands, to divorces, to arguments, to children.  It's predictable, and I did find Bette Midler's character just a little irritating, but that wasn't due to Bette Midler. It was just the way she played the character she annoyed me, she was so self centered. Barbara Hershey's character was fun, kinda the sidekick to CeCe, and Barbara actually got collagen injections in her lips to look younger, as she was playing her character through such a long period.  Of course you know Barbara's character is gonna get ill, but it's the way it's done, it's very subtle to start with, she starts looking more tired, and then it snowballs, and it's shocking how they manage to make her look so awful, she deteriorates really quickly, and I have to say the makeup artists did an excellent job there.  The funniest line in this film is my title for this review. "Over the shoulder boulder holders" is the perfect way to describe those annoying things called bras.  I've heard "Wind Beneath My Wings" many times before, and it's an extremely powerful song. What made a bigger difference was watching what was happening on screen, and listening to the lyrics, it brought a whole new meaning to the song, a meaning that I never got before. Well, that was me. Thankfully, I was watching this alone at the time, cos it would have been really embarrassing for someone to see me crying the way I did. To say Beaches had an effect on me is the understatement of the year. Even after I'd switched it off, I was still going about the house in tears. I'll never hear "Wind Beneath My Wings" the same again.  Unfortunately, I bought the bog standard, no frills, DVD, not realising that there was a special edition. But I'm quite happy with the edition I have. I'd probably cry through the extras too.  I'll probably watch this again (I still force myself to watch Armageddon & My Girl now & again, just because I love them that much), and I'll probably cry even more now I know what's coming. It's a terrific film, and is definitely the ultimate chick flick. It's also directed by Garry Marshall, so watch out for a cameo by Hector Elizondo 
  People who wish to learn more about 'Buddhist Ethics' will find this book useful. Along with Damien Keown's books, Peter Harvey's study will be invaluable for those who have neither the time nor the resources to explore primary sources for themselves.    Why only 'four stars' then? Like other reviewers, I'm not so sure that Buddhist Ethics can be reduced to 'natural ethics' - or regarded as analogous to natural ethics, on the assumption that as no 'God' is involved, we are safely outside 'theistic' considerations. In the wish to distance themselves from theocentric ethics, some Buddhists have tried to present Buddhism as 'natural' religion. But in actual fact, the terminology involved - either way, reflects Western categories of thinking.    Consider some of the problems here. Neo-pagans, the followers of 'Wicca' etc.- might well define themselves as adherents of 'natural' religion. Are we to conclude, then, that they are Buddhists - by another name?    Admittedly, much that we would define as 'ethical' - in Buddhism, is safely rooted in empirical experience. But on further examination, notions like 'karma' and karmic retribution cannot be 'explained' along purely naturalistic lines at all. Indeed, taken at face value, one could argue that nature per se, provides little evidence to support the idea of karma, which is quite important to the ethical world view of the Buddhists. I'm not questioning karma - in its proper context, I'm just stating that when push comes to shove, Buddhists do not attempt to account for karma in crude 'naturalistic' terms. Rather, it is part of an essentially spiritual world-view.    Hence, if not informed by 'theocentric' considerations, Buddhist ethics are - at their upper end, as it were, informed by assumptions of a 'transcendental' nature. I make this observation, because it is all too easy to approach Buddhism from the outside, believing that it is all neatly packaged, without any of the complications found in theocentric ethics.    This is not a criticism of Buddhism, just a reminder that it cannot be confined to 'natural' ethics, and may not be the simple, strictly 'rational' creed we once imagined.   For the most part, the ethical world view of the Buddhists is marked by impartiality, cool detachment, nothing fevered. Such detachment is evidently derived from something deeper than mere 'natural' religion.           
 I love this book so much because it helps me a lot when building my own Windows NT 4.0 intranet.  The book shows you how to intergrate DNS, DHCP, and WINS server.  The final chapter is about Microsoft Proxy Server and  you'll find it very helpful in this chapter. If you want to learn more  about Microsoft Networking, you should buy this book now 
 There are two basic styles of English prose. One is that of Dashiell Hammett - short words, short sentences, short paragraphs, short chapters, short novels. The other basic style is that of Charles Dickens - long passages of minute, detailed description. Zane Grey wrote in this second style, and he did it very well indeed. The American West comes alive in the pages of this book, a true classic. Calling this "purple prose" is like calling the music of the Grateful Dead "boogie" - it's a putdown that doesn't really mean anything. (Incidentally, a Grateful Dead offshoot band, New Riders of the Purple Sage, was named after this book.) Just as Alice chased a rabbit into Wonderland, so Venters chases a rabbit into Surprise Valley. He discovers true spirituality in the natural world and in other people - not in organized, denominational religion. The theme of this novel is that tyrannical fanaticism - religious and/or political - is dangerous and wrong. Grey was not specifically anti-Mormon. In fact, some of his Mormon charactors were good people. He was against any religious system that was out of control in its lust for power. Think of todays' "religious right", or for that matter, Islamic extremism. Grey would have disliked both 
 I was taking some classes at the college for a new career direction. One of the classes was Blueprint reading, not being proficiant with all construction terminology, I approached my teacher for some additional help. This was one of the books recomended to me. It did in fact help me quite a bit in the classroom, but also the diagrams and instructions are helpful in my daily work. I would recomend this book highly to newcomers in the consruction field, and I think it is a good reference book for those in the field already 
 Longer ago than I care to remember I had the great fortune to meet Einstein.  I was an under grad in college when he made one of his unannounced visits to the campus.  Walter Matthau captures the professor briliantly and his humor and wit come through in this film. Einstein's interest in motorcycles and his love of sailing are portrayed lovingly and the very human side of the great man is illustrated with fidelity and humor. It is always on my list of ten favorite films. 
 Any lesbian who has experienced a flirtation and/or seduction of a "straight" woman will get those same butterflies just from watching this film. What makes this film different from nearly every other lesbian film is how well Patricia Charbonneau (Cay) and Helen Shaver (Vivian) succeed at making us swoon through each and every one of their serendipitous encounters.  They tease and tempt us throughout their tentative, yet inevitable, romance right up until the ohmigod-i-want-you-to-touch-me-i-can't-believe-this-is-happening end! Whew! Yes,the sex scene is well worth the wait, but the getting to it is what really sets this film apart from all others.  I've seen Helen and Patricia in recent work and they both are still as hot as the desert in August! I wish Donna Deitsch would make a sequel with Cay and Vivian still together after all these years (with some bumps along the way of course)! 
 When I first heard Give Up I had gone to the record store intent on finding something fresh. I was just about to buy the new Interpol album and the Girl behind the counter tossed this into the stores cd player. I snaged a copy and listened to it on some headphones. At first I thought I was listening to a long lost record of the Pet Shop Boys :-) Give Up is a incredible album that grabs you from track 1 until the end of the album. The District Sleeps Alone Tonight, and Sleeping in are my favorites on this cd that has very few down points.  Heres tp wishing these guys team up again and make another album 
 This is a remarkable work by an eminent Byzantinist who has specialized in the anti-Latin polemical literature which was to have a profound effect in poisoning relations between medieval Latins and Byzantine Greeks and thereby impeding the union of the Churches.Such religious literature emanating largely from monastic circles and enumerating the abhorrent "errors" of the Latins proved to be far more influential in demonizing them than the works of professional theologians dealing with major dogmatic issues (such as the famous'Filioque'dispute) fueling the Schism between Rome and Constantinople.    What were the "errors" which imbedded themselves so deeply in the Byzantine psyche that they caused such fanatical hostility towards Westerners and a massive resistance to the union of the Churches? The Latins were guilty of pillaging and looting during the first 3 Crusades and the horrific sacking of Constantinople, but pious Byzantines were further assured by religious propaganda that the Latin "heretics" were, in addition, vulgar barbarians, alien to refined manners, indecent, and "utterly filthy in their failure to distinguish between sacred things, people, actions, and profane ones". Byzantine grievances were many: Latins ate unclean foods, had contact with bodily excretions, spit near the altar, consecrated a new pope by laying the hands of a dead pope upon him, used icons for toilet seats, etc., etc. These Lists of Latin errors constituted a fascinating species of Hate-literature, but they had a special effect on the Byzantine masses in making them fear, despise, and contemn their conquerors as well as the Byzantine unionists seeking to overcome "cross-cultural misunderstandings" exacerbated by chauvinistic and xenophobic polemics. Not all Byzantines, of course, fell victim to such irrational propaganda but such Lists clearly manifested "the most extreme manifestation of anti-Latin sentiment in Byzantium". Interestingly, this scholarly study reveals that the Byzantine theologians who contributed to the Lists evidenced some serious confusion concerning doctrine and discipline and what constituted necessary and optional elements of the faith.    Dr.Kolbaba utilizes the insights of cultural anthropologists and studies in the sociology of religion to analyze in some depth the psychology of medieval Greeks whose Byzantine orthodoxy and orthopraxis was fixated in liturgical and ritual forms regarded as sacred and immutable.    Students of Byzantine history, and Catholics and Eastern Orthodox seeking to understand the dynamics of the Byzantine Greco-Slav Schism will find this an enlightening study that can only further genuine ecumenism 
 Concisely written, Nohl gets to the point without many scholarly flourishes.  This volume would make an excellent confirmation gift for Lutheran youth.   Frederick Nohl's work is a reprinting of his original 1962 biography "Martin Luther: Hero of Faith" (Concordia Publishing House). The current version was meant to coincide with the 2003 release of the major motion picture "Luther" starring Joseph Fiennes, Alfred Molina and the late Sir Peter Ustinov.   If you thirst for a more in-depth scholarly but still readable approach to this subject, try the classic "Here I Stand" by Roland H. Bainton. Nohl accurately depicts reformer Luther's "middle way" between the Roman Church traditionalists and the newly spawned radicals like Andreas Carlstadt and Thomas Müntzer, advocates of complete political and theological revolution. Nor does Nohl soft-pedal Luther's frustration and awkward position during the Great Peasants' War in the Germany of 1524-25. Of greatest importance, however, is that Martin Luther rediscovered the "Gospel of grace", freeing the true Gospel message from its obscurity by centuries of layered fear and superstition, the bitter fruits of self-serving human traditions and the general biblical ignorance of the populace.  Europe was slowly emerging from the Middle Ages and could ill afford to look back.  The message of a gracious Gospel would in time be disseminated to all Christendom and provide a safe haven for the concept of "freedom of conscience".  But the message isn't about Luther.  He was both a self-acknowledged sinner and a saint (if only in the New Testament sense.) He would be taken aback by all the attention directed at him since the Reformation and be embarrassed that a major Protestant denomination had attached his name to themselves-quite against his wishes.  He could not have imagined the extent of the social and political repercussions of his life. No, it isn't about Luther: It's about the Christ to whom Luther pointed; it's about the Jesus who said that God has given us what we don't deserve and will never earn by our efforts.  If you think of Martin Luther without remembering this, you've missed the point.   
 Undoubtedly En Vogue's best work (followed closely by Born To Sing, Masterpiece Theatre and SoulFlower), this album shows that En Vogue is capable of being sassy, sexy, funky, strong, fun, diverse and able to tackle any genre.  Their voices never sounded better (check out "My Lovin' You're Never Gonna Get It", "Free Your Mind", "This Is Your Life", "Yesterday" and "Giving Him Something He Can Feel" to name a few) and they seem to have found their nitch and style that suits them best. 'Funky Divas' showed En Vogue for what they are; beautiful, stylist, fashionable, professional singers on the cutting edge who seem perfect!  Of all the En Vogue cd's, 'Funky Divas' is one you must have.  It embodies what En Vogue is about. Everything from R&B, Rock, Dance, Reggae to Soul - even a Beatles classic is featured on this album - which En Vogue cover effortlessly.    En Vogue.  Very possible the best girl group of all time 
 "Opium: A History" by Martin Booth is an engrossing work of nonfiction that details human reliance on opium for thousands upon thousands of years and how it has affected us physically, emotionally, economically, and morally.  The book starts with a discussion on the poppy flower itself and how opium is derived from the plant's sap and ending on the efforts of international traffickers, government enforcement agencies, and doctors alike in either expanding or eradicating addiction to opium.  In between, you will learn about opium's horrible effects on the body, Britain's establishment of the opium trade in China and later efforts to destroy it (counter to the rest of the world's reliance on opium to support their economies), the transformation of opium to heroin, the use of opium to inspire artists around the world, and the quiet and insidious opium trade that goes on with the permission of many governments to support war efforts and other international issues.  To me, the most fascinating thing I learned from this book was the amount of people addicted to the drug in the past because it was such an important painkiller/medicine and because it helped quiet fussy babies.  You can't help finish this book and wonder if it is even possible to win a war against a drug that has shaped the lives of so many humans and so many societies for thousands of years.  I personally found the book easy to read, though I preferred the first two-thirds of the book.  This part of the book covered the drug itself, its health affects, and its early history up to the nineteenth century.  I wasn't as interested in the international trafficking part of the book (the last one-third), probably because so many people, organizations, and countries were mentioned that I lost track of which country was fighting who and who was doing what with heroin or opium.  Still, the book is an eye-opening read.  The excruciating description of opium withdrawal should be mandatory reading for high school kids to help stymie any attempt at trying the drug.

 This is a great product for getting the bed head look.  I can use approximately a dime size worth in my palms and go wild!  Trust me, the results are great.  If you apply too much, you're hair will get oily. The good thing is that this product washes out easily with any Shampoo 
 Great reading.  Perfect for a relax after a stressful day at wor 
 Allison Krauss and Union Station really hit a bluegrass stride with this album.  A traditional sounding collection of songs displays a well suited female bluegrass lead vocal.  Allison sometimes gets a little "high  lonsome" sounding (Bill Monroe meets Emmylou Harris). Recent  recordings show her maturing style as she has softened and diversified her  vocals, but this is a tremendous collection that you will be glad to share  with purists and even folks that might sit long enough to listen to some  good ole time music.  With good performances on Guitar, Bass, Violin and  Dobro - I think a mandolin snuck into the mix more than once.  Musicians  will want to play along with this recording to get their chops in shape.  Your toes will be taping and a smile will spread across your face 
 Arguably, the most significant impact of Star Wars on popular culture was the merchandising of the movie into toys and collectibles with product far outgrossing the record levels the saga achieved in box office sales. Movie  merchandise, and toys in particular, with long development times and short  public attention spans were rarely seen as lucrative ventures throughout  movie history. But in 1977, Star Wars changed all that. Steve Sansweet's  book traces the development of the film into the most lucrative movie  license in history, showing rare and unproduced toy concepts that were  considered but abandoned.  With beautiful photos from Steve's personal  collection and rare photography from the Kenner archives, the reader sees  and learns about the development of the property.  When this book was  released in 1992, it shook the Star Wars collecting world and still remains  timeless today.  I keep referring to and pouring through Steve's  "Concept" book over and over again. Every Star Wars collector  needs to own this book 
 I have read tons of business thrillers. This one I could not put down. It was like the show 24. Never a dull moment. I loaned it to my daughter who is 25 and she loved it 
 Zig Ziglar definately gives alot of thoughts and ideas in the book. Some of the things he said, really hit home to me and I felt I could really apply what he was talking about. I listened to the Book on Tape. I just wish he wouldn't yell so much as he is talking. I had to keep adjusting the volume dial.  Other than that, it is a great book on tape. 
 After much pleading and prodding by my five-year-old son, I finally gave in and bought him "The Wiggles - Wiggle Time."  At first, I thought, "Oh no, another glibly tuneful romp through cartoonish juvenilia." But how wrong I was!  "The Wiggles" just may represent the only active, truly original modern art form practised by today's desiccated, so-called "artists". When one compares the underlying harmonic and polyphonic structure of a representative tune such as "hot potato dance," one realizes that such complexity and daring have never been heard since Strauss shocked even the jaded Parisians with "Salome"!  This is to take nothing away from the dance, however, which rivals anything ever choreographed by Balanchine. The dancers, eschewing the ambits of classical forms and steps, create their own pleitropic vocabulary of movements which bewilder the viewer with their genetic pregnancy.  Were this all that the "Wiggles" offered, one could easily imagine that their lack of immediate recognition for the geniuses that they are was due to the subtleties of their art and the jealousies of less talented peers. But only after viewing the disk repeatedly and incessantly (I had to purchase a second copy for myself) did I realize the entirety and awful enormity of the "Wiggles" experience. Such was my shock of insensing comprehension that I felt the universe close around me into a point of awareness centered on one sublime, beautiful, yet terrible truth. I struggled mightily to force order into the epiphany which the "Wiggles" graced upon me. But I could not.  Therefore, gentle reader, take heart from my woe. No measure of wisdom or beauty should cost a man his soul. 
 I loved this book and could not put it down!  Great research was done and references to other books to read was helpful, all the research was done for you.  I have cancer or should I say had!  My tumor was removed in October 2006 and scans a few weeks ago showed the all clear.  I refused post surgical Chemo, I had Radiation and Chemo before surgery and that did my body in.  I was Stage III and 40 years old......my doctor told me I was his ONLY patient to refuse Chemo, what does that tell us?!  He is a great medical doctor and I will stay with him to monitor me.....but I will SURVIVE and show him there are other ways.  I am now getting a degree in Holistic Nutrition because of my readings about cancer.  God Bless,  Liz [... 
 Big Joe Turner was the premier blues shouter of the postwar era and did everything from boogie-woogie and jump blues to the first wave of rock & roll.  Even those who have never heard Turner sing have heard "Shake, Rattle & Roll," which was specifically written for him by Charles Calhoun (Jesse Stone), but you probably heard the sanitized version that was popularized by Bill Haley and the Comets.  On "The Very Best of Big Joe Turner" you get to hear the original version, with its big bounce and raunchy lyrics.  You will also learn why you should associate the name Big Joe Turner with the idea of screaming rock & roll songs.  With this issue from Rhino Records, part of their series of reissuing classic blues and R&B material from the vaults at Atlantic Records.  What Rhino did was take a dozen tracks from Atlantic's "Big Joe Turner's Greatest Hits" and add another four tracks, "TV Mama" and "Midnight Cannonball," both of which were written by Turner, and "You're Driving Me Crazy (What Did I Do?)" and "Tomorrow Night."  The common denominator on those tracks is that they are more rock & roll than R&B, which is just fine with me.  The choice tracks are the rocker "Honey Hush," the aforementioned original version of "Shake, Rattle & Roll," "Flip, Flop and Fly" (which supposedly has leftover verses from "Shake, Rattle & Roll"), "The Chicken and the Hawk (Up, Up and Away)" and "Corrine Corrina," which has been done by everybody from Red Nichols to Dean Martin.  But then you will discover that the more you know about the early days of rock & roll the more you will realize you have heard covers of some of these songs by the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley.   Also, because this is Rhino, we are once again talking excellent liner notes, compiled this time around by Billy Vera.  The only complaint is that the cover picture of Big Joe Turner is actually the smallest picture of the singer I have seen to date.  Irony abounds.  The only reason not to give this album five stars is because there are Big Joe Turner collections that have more than 16 tracks on them, but I really like the selection here because my primary interest is in rockabilly and the early days of rock & roll more than the blues and R&B you get with some of the other collections, which are five star albums in their own rights.  Most of these songs were produced by Atlantic's Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler, which explains why there is a definitive sound here.  If you check out the 1956 film "Shake, Rattle & Rock" you can catch Turner lip-synching a couple of his hits, along with Fats Domino and the music of Frédéric Chopin

 My almost-two-year-old grandson loves the Cheerios book series.  My daughter commented that the purpose of the book is well served - he likes eating the Cheerios!  The Cheerios help make the learning activities fun.  I've bought some of the books for gifts for friends' kids, too 
 The book covered almost all material on the first exam which i just got back from passing.  Many of the practice questions had a letter answer that did not match the explanation answer.  It seemed like there was no proofreading of the questions and answers.  The author also defers a lot of the subjects to other books.  Overall the book was OK.  I used only it, and test kings in order to study and pass the exam 
 I have seen the original Dutch version by Director Sluizer, and this one holds up quite well on its own. Jeff Harriman (Kiefer Sutherland) stops at a gas station with his girlfriend Diane (Sandra Bullock). In a matter of minutes, she disappears without a trace. And although Jeff searches everywhere for her, she vanishes without ever being heard from again. He lives every moment of his life trying to locate her. Putting flyers everywhere, and even going on TV.  The abducter of Diane is Barney Cousins (Jeff Bridges). I don't wish to give away the plot about what happened to her, however, I will write that Barney contacts Jeff and tells him that he admires his persistence in trying to locate Diane after so many years. He gives Jeff a chance to experience what happened to Diane, but at a cost. Enter Rita Baker (Nancy Travis) who is also the latest love interest of Jeff. Her role in the film is very important. Barney Cousins is a sociopath, and he has been abducting women for some time. How long, the viewer is never told, but it is not a spur of the moment type of abduction. He is very methodical.  As I wrote in the beginnig, I have seen the original, and while it is quite good, this film also is a very good and suspenseful film. The character of the sociopath, played by Jeff Bridges is very good. He is very convincing in his part. As for Kiefer Sutherland, I thought he gave a very good performance. Disregard some of the negative reviews on this film. Just because the original is on Criterion, and in Dutch, does not necessarily negate this very good and suspensful film. I have the DVD, but it is only listed on VHS at amazon. It might be out of print. If you can, grab the DVD; I assure you that you will not be disappointed. [Stars: 4.5] 
 This book not only answered all the questions my 5 year old Davey had, it kept him persuing his determination to "read the big words" as soon as he could.  Wonderful, informative reading for all ages 
 If you're looking for a detailed overview of how the forest ecosystem works, this is a great reference.  Perry covers soil, nutrients, forest dynamics, etc.  If you are new to the sciences, Perry does a good job of explaining key terms.  This book is geared more towards science-minded people, but the material is broad enough for anyone interested in the forest 
 Joseph Mitchell's newspaper writing is Mitchell at his best; young, fresh and delightful. He tells in 1500 or so words booklength stories made all the more powerful by the brevity. A text book on writing and reporting. 
 I have been looking for a windshirt for my husband for quite some time now. This is  very soft, warm (but not too warm) jacket that has the word "PING" on the sleeve, two crossed golf clubs on the front and a cute PING cartoon guy on the back of the neck.  It fits great, although I have to say the Large may fit some people that usually buy Mediums, especially if you're going to put anything underneath it.  Great service from 'stitch with us' as well. 
 Me personnally I think that SWV is the greatest female trio of all time. Every albulm they made was hot, I thought at first that the second one was not that good but I listened to it and it came out to be my favorite. So I hope they (SWV) read this and think about coming back or maybe they want to leave the industry like they did on top.  
 This was great, the cd was sent to my home in Iceland and it took very little time to get here from the day I ordered it 
 UFO..an already awesome group....make even more awesome..with a new member in the line... guitar god Vinnie Moore....a must have DVD for both UFO and Vinnie Moore fans out there 
 An incredible account of military heroism against seemingly insurmountable odds. A must read for those who truly want to understand the meaning of service and dedication. A heartfelt thanks to John Plaster and his fellow SOG members 
 Kathy Dobie's book is truely great.  She talked about the stereotypes put on women and reminds us that even today some things haven't changed regarding womens sexuality and how open they can be regarding their sexual practices but still reminds me a 23 years old women that stereotypes are still alive today.  Many women can identify with her life and sexual experience whether good or bad.  I couldnt put the down I finished it in one night.  Truely amazing 
 I got the book within a week of order. The book arrived in great condition. It was a good experience, stress free 
 No part of this book struck home for me more than the contrast of two elections that took place in November 2004.  In both elections exit polls showed one candidate with a strong majority of the popular votes, yet the official tallies show the other candidate winning.  The exact same individual oversaw both exit polls.  Yet in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, there was an international outcry of fraud and election theft fueled by the outrage between the official tallies and their variance with the exit polls, an outrage in which the White House joined.  As a result Eduard Shevardnadze was forced by international opposition out of office.  In the other election, however, instead of the exit polls calling into question the official results, the exit polls themselves were declared in error.  Exit polls are astonishingly accurate.  Internationally they are used as a gauge of how fair and valid an election is.  Except in the United States.  For some reason, the idea that an election in the United States could be stolen is unthinkable, and I will confess that while I heard many stating that the 2004 election was fraudulent, without knowing the facts I wrote the claims off as conspiracy theories.  But facts are stubborn critters and while you might be able to suppress them for a while, they will eventually rear their heads.  And in the 2004 election both exit polls and a number of other statistics suggest that there was a substantial shifting of votes from John Kerry to George Bush.  That the GOP has tried to subvert the Democratic process is beyond question.  The attempt to scrub voter roles in Florida and elsewhere is not only well documented, those harmed by such actions have won court actions alleging civil rights violations.  Undeterred by the law and the Justice Departments, the states just went ahead and scrubbed the voter roles again.  The book also mentions the blatant attempts to suppress voter registration by African-Americans and other minorities as well as numerous other tactics of Republicans to keep groups who are likely to vote Democrat from voting.  History has shown repeatedly that large voter turn outs as well as maximum voter inclusion strongly favors Democrats.  Republicans have long responded by attempting to keep people off voter roles or hindering people from voting.  But this book is not in the end about these voters.  What Freeman and Bleifuss want to account for is the significant and statistically improbable (so improbable to be a near impossibility) gap between the exit polls (which are substantiated by other polls and statistics) and the official vote totals that Kerry and Bush received in 2004.  Although it is now definitively known that the 2000 election was won by Al Gore (it is simply a fact that the judge in charge of the recount in Florida was going to authorize a state wide recount of all the undervotes, which would have provided Gore with a very comfortable victory--the recount did not go forward because the federal judiciary in the form of the Supreme Court intervened in a purely state matter, in what is incontestably one of the worst violations of judicial authority in American history), it now appears that in fact Kerry both earned a higher total in both popular and electoral votes than Gore did or should have won in 2000.  In other words, we now know that Gore unquestionably should have won the 2000 election, and there is substantial evidence that Kerry even more decisively defeated Bush in 2004.  Republicans will call anyone impugning the outcome of the 2004 election a sore loser, but numbers are numbers.  Anyone who remembers the election of 2004 will remember television analysts before the polls closed talking about how glum the White House was, how sullen and unhappy those gathering for the GOP election party were, how elated Democrats were.  Why?  The exit polls were showing a very strong victory by Kerry.  To be specific, the exit polls showed Kerry winning between 282 and 364 electoral votes and between 5 million and 7 million popular votes.  Later the exit poll results were "adjusted" to reflect the official tallies, but the raw data showed a strong Kerry victory, especially in the key battleground states of Ohio, Nevada, and New Mexico by numbers well outside the margin of error, as well as probable victories in Florida, Iowa, and Colorado, though there inside the margin of error.  In addition, Bush victories in Virginia, North Carolina, and Missouri were well within the margin of error.  Suspiciously, virtually every state exit poll showed Kerry doing significantly better in almost every state than he actually did.  Only in a couple of states did Bush do worse than exit polls predict, and those were Republican strongholds where Kerry did only one or two tenths of a percentage point better, not only within the error of margin but statistically insignificant.  All told, the exit polls indicated that Kerry nationwide should have done 6.5% better in the popular vote than he was credited with.  Again, the question of why this divergence between the popular vote and the exit polls would be significant in former Soviet Georgia but not the US has to be raised.  One of the great absurdities of the 2004 election was the silly theory of the uncooperative Bush responder.  Bush voters, so the theory postulates (and it is pure postulation, since there is utterly no evidence for this--in fact, there is some evidence that Bush voters actually were more likely to respond to exit pollsters), were reluctant to answer pollsters' questions.  Nevermind that there isn't the tiniest shred of evidence for such a presumption; it because near orthodoxy in the days following the election.  It is uncanny how such a baseless belief gained such strength.  What is more amazing is that almost everyone agreed--without seeing the raw exit poll data--that the exit polls and not the final vote total must be suspect.  There really are no grounds for this conclusion exception a profound reluctance to consider the possibility that Bush's people stole millions of votes.  Yet the evidence points in that direction more easily than in the direction of the theory of the reluctant Bush voter.  So if votes were stolen, how were they?  This is a harder question to answer.  We know that there was vast voter suppression on the part of the GOP, but actual theft of votes is more in the way of speculation.  The data definitely suggests THAT votes were stolen but does not describe HOW it was stolen.  The book describes many ways that the votes could have been stolen, though one of the main culprits could be the electronic voting machines that became so much more widespread in the 2004 election.  I would love to go into just a few of the many problems with using electronic voting machines, which have an amazingly spotty record so far.  Anecdotally a very large number of people asserted problems with the machines switching votes to Bush as they looked at the screen, but the problems are greater than that.  Electronic votes without a paper trail cannot be checked later for accuracy.  And because the manufacturers refuse to reveal to anyone--not even government officials--the details of either their software or the hardware, there is no way to have confidence in them.  One votes on an electronic machine in blind faith that it is accurate.  Yet it is well known that without proper evaluation and inspection of the software and hardware, the machines could easily shift large numbers of votes from Kerry to Bush.  Most likely this is what happened in the 2004 election.  Again, there is no concrete evidence that this happened, but the proven unreliability of the machines and the resistance of the manufacturers to have their machines inspected makes the machines the likely suspect.  THAT the votes were stolen is proven by the exit polls, while HOW they were stolen remains an unanswered question.  I have only one doubt about whether the election of 2004 was stolen and that lies with the fact that to pull this off requires a conspiracy of silence with a very large number of people.  Or perhaps not.  If the software engineer at Diebold, for instance, wrote some holes in the software that would enable a switch of votes or the creation of votes (there were several districts where more votes were cast than there were voters), this would not involve many people.  One person could write the code, and then several tech support people could update the software once the full ballot was known.  In fact, many of the machines did receive software patches immediately before the election.  But I at this point find it harder to believe that every exit poll in every battleground state could be up to ten points off than that a software geek got George Bush elected president.  We should be very worried.  Though polls show Democrats with a substantial lead over Republicans going into the 2006 election and Bush enormously unpopular in the polls, and although lame duck presidents almost always see their party lose a significant number of congressional representatives in the final off year election, we might not see that this time.  Is it possible that the Republican Party has perfected the art of stealing elections?  We know that many within the GOP have a Manichean mindset where the only good individuals are card-carrying members of the Republican Party and Democrats liberals who are assigned to the outer darkness.  Many on the Right possess a view of the world whereby they could see it as a moral or religious duty to disenfranchise those secular liberals.  But if my fears hold true and Democrats once again fail to do as well as polls indicate that they should, I think we should all become very, very suspicious.  I can live with the idea of a conservative in the White House.  I won't like it, but I can accept the will of the people.  But what angers and upsets me is that in both 2000 and 2004, the will of the people was subverted.  This book should be read by every American of either party who cares about the preservation of the democratic process 
 This is the prequel to the O'Malley Series.  The books in this series are awsome.  Dee Henderson has become one of my favorites. She has a way of making the reader a part of the story and looking forward to the next! Suspense, romance, friendship, it's all there and more.  
 Caroline Knapp was a truly remarkable individual with so much love to give and share. In her short time after recovering from alcohol and other issues she was working through, she gave us her love, wisdom, strength, and hope in her written word.   I have never read an author that has touched my soul like Caroline has. Everyday I think about her, her life, and her legacy. Caroline, even though you are not here in the physical form, you will always be with me in the spiritual form. When I re-read sections of her books, they tend to always be fresh, alive, and as if I have never read them before. God speaks and teaches us through people. Caroline, you have given me the two most important lessons for my own alcohol and emotional recovery - hope and love.   I hope Caroline's twin sister, Dr. Rebecca Knapp, her sister's legacy by being a voice for Caroline's struggles 
 Barry uses his own style on some of the greats from "Old Blue Eyes".  Enjoyable listening 
 James Kitfield has studied one of the most turbulent times in American military history and distilled its lessons into one tightly written narrative that is both engaging and full of tremendous insight. The passage through the ranks of the Vietnam generation officer corps molded our 1980's military into a truly revolutionary force. Their experiences in the muddle of Vietnam and the lessons they extracted colored every decision and every reform they sought in their service. In the end, while not perfect, these able officers forged a doctrine based around rapid, audacious movement, technology and local authority--all things lacking in Vietnam. The payoff came with the tremendous victory in the 1991 Gulf War.  This book needs to be read by every officer in every service. Study this, extract the lessons. Many of the mistakes made during the Vietnam-Era have now repeated themsleves in the War on Terror. Many of the lessons Colin Powell and others taught us during Desert Storm have already been forgotten.   If you are an officer, buy this book. Let it guide you through the many critical decisions you will have to face during the years ahead as you work your way through your own career. And never forget the most important lesson of all: never chose your career and its future over doing the right thing. Prodigal Soldiers pointedly demonstrates that when senior officers do that, men die needlessly.

 My preschoolers love this book. Smiley shark is a great book for learning about the ocean or talking about teeth or just having fun reading. The story line is simple. All the creatures are scared of Smiley Shark until one day he saves them from a fisherman's net and they all become his friend. the Story is wrote very nicely and the art work is wonderful.  I have read this book several time to the children and they often will ask to read it again. Another great book is "Shark Trouble," About two monkeys trapped on small seperate islands with sharks swimming around the islands. All the kids love the shark books. 
 I just finished the book and plan to read it again from cover to cover. It will definitely pay for itself and is one of the best trading books I've read. It is also well written and offers some good ideas on money management as well.   When I first got the book I skipped to the chapters that offered different systems so I could put them to use then I went back and started at the beginning.   I wish I could have read the whole book before losing money in the market. Hopefully my future performance will be better now that I've read it.  Michelle Res 
 This is a pretty doggone good book!  The last chapter, especially the last two pages of the text, provides an excellent synopsis of the long standing problem on the structure of matter. It seems that what is left to be done involves the invention or creation of a different mathematical source which is capable of generating a symmetric tensor of rank two that  will successfully displace the singularity thru the proper incorporation of the energy tensor, Tuv.  This would most certainly shed a new light on the generation of mass and the inherent formation of matter: Form defines Function, Function generates Form.  You Betcha!! 
 Massoretic studies is an extremely recondite branch of Biblical Studies.  Few people ever study those cryptic notes found on the margins of medieval texts.  Any-one interested in this field should read a more basic text like Kelley's, "Introduction to the Masorah of BHS."  Emmanuel Tov's "Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible" Is also a helpful prelude to Yeivin. If your curiosity is only increased by those books, Yeivin is the next logical step.  The Massoretes also intruduced the accent marks which have complex grammar of their own.  Yeivin is the only modern scholarly work that explains them in detail.  If you fully understand Yeivin and are still interested-- congratulations, you are now one of the few Massoretic scholars in the world. Get thyself a Critical Edition and read thou the notes therein 
 For my money, this is Iris Murdoch's best novel. Many of her recurring motifs are here: an interest in Buddhism and other things mystical, swimming, homosexuality, lots of food and drink, a love affair, deep and unfathomable matters of philosophy. But this is perhaps where she gets the mix right, or more right than anywhere else. The central love affair is compelling and moving, though perhaps a little far-fetched. The main male character is very amusing. The setting, though, is perhaps the joy of the book: a rugged seaside spot in the North of England where the sea is a churning blue-green cauldron, freezing cold and dangerous. Only the Brits would delight in bathing in such a place, as the characters do here. But of course they are right. Dame Iris loved such swimming holes. And they are exhilarating places. Not little chlorinated Californian puddles of warmth. The real sea. The Sea, The Sea. Great fun 
 Sandburg is one of the greatest poets the US has had, so much that he became an American icon. His poems use a language that everyone can understand and he speaks of subjects that we all know. He is one of the finest poets we've ever had, and to be able to get this collection for around a dollar, you'd have to be a fool to pass on this 
 We bought this TV because it had a small enough height to fit below kitchen cabinets. However it has performed better than other larger and more expensive sets that we have. In particular, when viewed at an angle, its picture is comparable to that of a vacuum tube, unusual in my experience for an LCD screen. For those who are thinking of a huge flat panel TV, buy this one instead and sit closer to it 
 Anything written about the Underground Railroad is positive. It was, and remains, the most singular movement in our Nation's history where Americans decided, through a massive grass roots effort, to change the fundamental policy of their government. It is something to be very proud of.  The Fugitive Slave Law, enacted in the early 1850s was uncomfortably Nazi-like legislation. It projected the very real police state that existed throughout the South in support of slavery into all other States as well. This fundamentally repugnant laws was ultimately defeated not by Armies in the field, but by the simple recognition by the common person that they were fundamentally wrong: This law took everyone's rights away. And it is the passage of this law, with its concurrent stripping of all of our citizens' individual rights that, in the end, defeated slavery.  How a privileged few were able to dominate Southern society remains a mystery to many of us today. For the most part everyone knows the slavery argument was over cotton but few today understand the incredible wealth, North and South that was at stake. Cotton was GLOBAL trade and the agricultural Southern United States was the main underpinning. Cotton drove the Industrial Revolution in both Europe and the United Stares. It made nations and broke them. It WAS international trade. No other good or product came close to its wealth generating ability. Unfortunately, the fundamental bedrock, the foundation for all of this amazing wealth generation, was slavery.  Fergus M. Bordewich has penned a good compendium that details the depth and the scope of the remarkable social movement that came to be known as the Underground Railroad. It is a journey that freed a people, not just back, but white as well. It was a movement that was the most unselfish act of civil disobedience America has ever known. As a way of thinking, it did not end with the conclusion of the Civil War and Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation but rather has come to define the continuing journey of our country, defining just what kind of country we will be.  Mr. Bordewich does a very credible job of describing the magnitude of and the unselfish participation by all of our ancestors who rebelled against the loathsome wrong that slavery was. You do not want to miss this story. 
 This DVD is essential to anyone wanting to be on the executive side of the music industry.  This DVD shows the hard work and tears it takes to maintain in the music industry and its rewards 
 I loved this book. It had me laughing, crying and biting my nails. I fell in love with the characters and knew that I had to continue reading her other navy SEAL books just to read more about Ken and Savannah. It was action packed, filled with suspense, and great sex. I love her books, but this one is my favorite 
 An excellent book on the basics of graphic design. One of the hardest books to find (despite the seeming abundance of them being published) is a well rounded book of design that is useful to both the beginning and advanced student of graphic design. This book provides a strong overview of topics ranging from the pragmatic (project briefs, client interaction) and the technical (grids, hierarchies, typography) to the elusive (intuition, conceptualization). It also provides specific information (anatomy of grids, use of em and en dashes, classification of typefaces) that I've had to go to separate books for in the past. As the title implies though, it does not cover issues that don't directly relate to graphic layouts (e.g. logos, signage, websites) though many of the principles can be applied to them. It also does not delve deeply into color systems, just looking at the role of color in hierarchies and compositions.  I find the title slightly misleading in that it is not what I would normally consider a workbook. It covers the entire design process step by step, so in that sense its very instructional but when I think of workbooks I imagine sample projects, worksheets, etc. It has more in common with an instructional / reference / design specimen book (a third of the book is a catalog of design projects done by professional designers). As mentioned above its focus is print layouts so there is little direct reference to web or interface design.  Overall, it is a well conceived, well designed book that gives a design student the basics of print design and can replace a variety of other books on your shelf 
 This is a beautifully written book that makes you feel like you are in Iran at the time of the revolution. Ms. Hakakian's prose brings to life the sounds, smells and feel of life in revolutionary Iran, through the eyes of a young girl.  Not only is it an enjoyable book to read, but educational as well, especially for Americans whose view of these times was tinted by the media, offering us a singular view of Iran. Ms. Hakakian offers a beautiful mosaic of her life in Iran and the emotions of becoming a stranger in  your own land. Read it and enjoy 
 This beautiful paperback is just over a hundred pages, but it packs a punch with the gorgeous black and white photo illustrations.  Each is accompanied by text in both Italian and English explaining the technical aspects and the nuances of each gesture.  This timeless guide was first published in 1958, and the 2005 re-release is a must-have for anyone studying Italian language and culture.  (No vulgar gestures included. 
 the text provides new perspectives on an age-old topic - having conversations. I have found the examples and strategies presented both informative and insiteful for all types of conversations - personal, professional, and casual.  A definite "buy" in my book.. 
 This book was recommended to me while I was engaged to my wife.  It is an awsome book.  Mr. Trobisch cast a very clear and poignant perspective to the relationship of marriage.  A perspective only God could give.  This book should be required reading for all high school and college students who have thoughts, questions, or ideas about marriage and also required for all of us who are now married.  I plan on having this classic in my household for all of my children to read 
 there's not much that can be said about the storyline without giving away a lot that develops within the twin stories. the stories do connect-again shreve poses a few questions with the issues she selects. just one question: has human emotional outburst been replaced as an evolutionary affect by wishful thinking, a kind of joan didion's magic thinking, and both affects capable of events and results? maybe i'm getting much too abstruse. let me just say, the weight of water is very thought provoking, while being a breezy read. i want to believe goethe would had enjoyed this book. there i go again, and so many readers of serious fiction dismiss the novels of anita shreve as light weight 
 If you are just looking for recipes, don't bother with this book. This FANTASTIC publication is geared toward the serious 'cuisine-o-phile', who loves to read about food, not just eat it. I have at least a hundred books about food and this is a gem. It gives a few pages on dozens of spices, rice types, pulses, and other basics of Indian cooking and provides interesting information on each along with a couple of example recipes. Well worth the very reasonable price 
 If only there were more songs on this CD! The five that do appear are fun and exhilirating--definitely a way to perk up your spirits after encountering any Scrooges. "Coventry Carol" is haunting, "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" hypnotic and a blast, "Good King Wenceslas" and "Snow" beautiful, and "Seeds of Love" an interesting introduction and adaptation of a traditional English folk song into holiday music. Loreena McKennitt's contributions to the season are worth exploring for anyone tired of the blase Christmas carols found in shopping malls these days.  
 Longboard Jazzer asks, will he ever top his dad. The answer is yes. To me he's much better. Especially when you consider he's not recorded by the likes of Rudy Van Gelder whose catalogue almost never ceases to disappoint from an audiophile point of view. This record features Drew Gress on bass also. John Coltrane never had a bassist of his talent to play with and the recording engineers from the 50s and 60s obviously were at a loss as how to record a bass instrument. The recording quality is great and the music is hip. I'm a jazz fan but I don't like a lot of jazz, probably not even most jazz. I like this kind of jazz - contemporary jazz. In fact it reminds me of a very good disc called Contemporary Jazz by Branford Marsalis. One difference is that this disc is recorded well, Contemporary Jazz is not. I haven't heard Ravi's other recordings so I can't compare. I like this music and it gets better the more I listen. It's complicated, sophisticated, and not too "out there", but just enough for me 
 Death in Venice (1912) is a disturbing story, one that is not easy to forget. It is also exceptional literature, a classic of the twentieth century. Thomas Mann's Death in Venice might be best compared to the subtle, psychologically complex fiction of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.    In Munich the aging, highly respected author Gustav Aschenbach is in need of change, rest in a new setting, to overcome his growing fatigue that is impacting his writing. While recovering in Venice, Aschenbach slowly, but inexorably, becomes mesmerized by a young Polish boy staying at the seashore with his aristocratic family. Aschenbach is intellectually aware of his growing obsession, but he is seemingly unable to break away. Thomas Mann's somber portrayal of this troubled man is a masterpiece of subtle nuances and psychological intensity.  Thomas Mann's lengthy sentences and complex grammatical structures severely complicate the task of translating Death in Venice. I have read two excellent and yet substantially different translations. The most faithful translation is by Stanley Appelbaum (Dover edition, 1995). This new translation tries to be as literal as possible, carefully preserving the comparative length of the original sentences as well as the internal sequence of each original German sentence.  Contrastingly, the H. T. Lowe-Porter translation is considered the most delightful and readable version, although at the expense of subdividing many of Mann's lengthy sentences. Lowe-Porter's version has been the standard translation for many years.     The Dover edition provides an excellent 10-page commentary, including footnotes 
 Prince's 1986 romantic comedy "Under the Cherry Moon" finally received the DVD treatment it deserved in the Summer of 2004. When the film was released, it was bombarded with bad reviews but this film is actually decent. Of course the music stands out but it actually succeeds as a comedy. The acting may be full of flaws but it's the 80's, what do you expect? Prince and Jerome Benton , from The Time, are gigolos living it up in South France and they come across a beautiful heiress (Kristin Scott Thomas) who happens to get her trust fund on her 21st birthday. They both woo her for the money but Prince ends up catching feelings for her. With a beautifully filmed movie and an incredible soundtrack, "Under the Cherry Moon" fails to disappoint 
 1970s suburbian life style is the setting of this compelling novel. This story follows the lives and drama surrounding a small town where four beautiful girls try to break free of their strict parents in very sinful ways. The book is narrated by a small groups of boys who become bewitched and pulled into the drama of these young girls lives. I absolutely love this book it was so real and full of heart and sisterly honour. That may not sound so great to those who understand the kind of honour these girls have with one anothers but its a wonderful novel that isnt for the faint at heart. It hits hard into a common death and problem among young girls and young boys 
 This is a HUGE book. It has pretty much everything you could want -- both north and south indian vegetarian cooking.  Not only does it have hundreds of recipes, but it's got a wealth of information on technique and the basic ingredients and building blocks of Indian vegetarian cooking.  It even has a simple little experiment you can do with potatoes, using three different general approaches to spicing. After which you will understand, first-hand, how these three approaches change the flavors of the food. There are other, what I would call "cooking lessons" here and there in the book.  The glossary is really an encyclopedia of the basic concepts, ingredients, and procedures in indian vegetarian cooking.  The book is PURE vegetarian without fish or eggs.  This is both the what and how of Indian vegetarian cooking. If you really studied this book you could open a restaurant! Or just use it the way I do, as a reference book for every type of indian vegetarian food 
 Just when you believe that you've heard or read all that can be said or written about the beginning of World War I, along comes a book that throws all of your preconceived notions into a tither. This extremely well-written work goes into great (and very interesting) detail about the actions and activities that led to this tragedy. The author points out that Austria wanted to punish Serbia, but really didn't want to get into a wider war. The German General Staf, however, wanted to encourage Austria to attack Serbia so that Germany could have an excuse to battle both Russia and France, due to the belief that Germany was slowly losing its military advantage in Europe. Now was the time, they believed, to have a war when Germany was ready and France and Russia were not. Even the bellicose Kaiser comes off as more prudent than his generals, for in the final run, he was interested in preserving the peace, but couldn't stand up to his military and political leaders. He eventually agreed with them for fear that his opposition could lead to his overthrow. This is an extremely important book, with new information and insight on a very old question: who's responsible for the start of the Great War? 
  This is arguably the greatest British novel concerning the first world war; the society it changed and killed off forever, and the sheer state of stagnation and disaster of English society and social structure(and that of both her allies and enemies in the great war) that led to millions of needless deaths and the death of Britain (and europe) as dominant world powers; that mantle being handed over to America.   From such a simple story of doomed love and repression,Madox Ford is one of only a handful of English writers who can capture the essense of England and push through his message with such force.   I expect some readers will find the book a little slow;errudite and jar a little at the couple of anti semite comments made (Disraeli as a loathsome little jew) but in a way that better evokes the era. Europe tried to recapture its lost dominance by using the jew as a scapegoat that culminated in an even bigger tragedy less than a generation later.   A true-and criminally forgotten-masterpiece 
 This is not so much an instructional book as it is a design aid. I am kind of a novice but I can read knitting patterns and I like designing my own projects sometimes instead of just copying everything out of knitting books. If you are looking for a how-to-knit book this isn't it, but this is a great pictoral reference of many different stitches that can help a knitter design their own projects or test out newly acquired knitting skills in different patterns. I enjoyed the setup of the patterns, although it is unorthodox, and I thought the setup of the book itself was great. I cant wait to learn all of these interesting stitches, particularly the cool Victorian looking lace patterns 
 I just wanted to let you know that this book has been  very helpful for my daughter. She is about ready to take the GED test with confidence.        Thank you for the quick shipment.                                  Lori Collin 
 don't hate, cash money does it real big, this cd is more than hot, and more than on fire.  I love allllllllllll of cash money's music, they don't have to have crunk music to cover up  bad lyrics, their lyrics are hard, their beats are hard, and plus, this is a collection of some of their greatest!!!!!! 
 This is my first Cannell "book" although I have watched and enjoyed many of his TV shows.  I am a very eclectic reader and am hardly ever without a book at hand -- I thought Ride the Snake was a pretty good story line.  It would do well as a made-for-TV movie or even a big screen.  Like one of the other reviewers I would like to see a sequel.  I really liked the change in Wheeler and to hell with his mother and her money!  I think he made the right choice.  Good quick read 
 I've read most of Dean Koontz' books and for the most part, I've enjoyed all of them. Most of his books are what I consider just sci-fi/fantasy; a good thriller read.  I think I'd have given this one a 5 if there was less fantasy.  I got the feeling he wrote this book in the hopes it would become a screenplay, a combination of a King/Spielberg wannabe.  I listened to this on audio, my Koontz first, and I found that in the midst of my road rage during rush hour traffic, I wasn't missing a lot of the plot.  I really could imagine this on film, and given the length of the audio book, minus all of the flowery descriptions, it would make a great 2 hour movie.  However, I got a pleasant surprise at the end, and I absolutely loved it.  His explanation of Armageddon vs. "Alien invasion" made the book, in my opinion.  It will make you think.  This wasn't one of his worst books, it was one of his best.  Give it a try. 
 This was one of my favorite Shakespeare tragedies because despite Lear bringing the misfortune on himself, the reader truly does feel for sorry for him.  When Cordelia could not declare her love to Lear like her sisters did, he takes this as a lack of love for him.  Of course it wasn't, but Lear's desperate neccesity for admiration from those around eventually becomes his downfall.  While all of that action is going on, Gloucester's illegitimate son, Edmund is on the rise to power, hoping to overtake his brother.  King Lear is obviously a tragedy, but there is one aspect of it at the end that is truly rewarding to the reader.  Though none of Shakespeare's plays are, read this one and you definetly won't be dissapointed 
 This book is another example of Stephen Arroyo's expertise & is presented in lecture style, paying some very valuable at- tention to transits as life processes. He & I differ completely on the issue of "reincarnation", believing in heredity & our own past behaviors as "karma" myself, but the insights in this  book are designed to help the Astrologer/student learn to form  their own insights...to actually Think when interpreting a chart! Invaluable aid as it is, I recommend it highly to those wishing  to understand more about synthesis in their interpretations... chart comparisons may be especially useful also. A "relaxed" attitude about difficult transits of the outer planets will put many minds at ease concerning these difficult times we all must face, & this section alone may be worth the price of this book 
 I'm biased here, OK, cuz I grew up w/the author & was there for a lot of this graphic novel as it happened...Shane paints a tough look back at growing up in our hometown in NNY.  The artwork is splendid and enhances the surreal moments of this tale & also never lets the reader leave the grip of the plot.  Be ready for some harsh, revealing story elements that are given a strange visual beauty in North Country.  Nice work, Shane!  More on the way??  
 What a bargain, I bought this shoe on amazon for $29.99. Very unusual shoe I get a lot of compliments on it. I like the lace-to-toe design and is easy to get in and out because it's round shoelaces. 
 What if someone could read aloud so well that a book came to life?  How amazing, how thrilling and yet, how dangerous would that be?  How much power would that person wield and . . . what sort of people would want to take advantage of it? Funke explores all of these questions in INKHEART, in fantastic, yet realistic detail.   This book is a celebration of the power of the written word. Cornelia Funke has written a classic, enduring for its amazingly real characters, a plot that twists and turns within a labyrinth of choices, and imagery that makes the whole thing dance with fearsome energy.  The story is carried on excellently in INKSPELL and I await breathlessly the third novel 
 This has become one of my favorite Grisham books (it ranks up there with The Firm and The Client).  I love the topic being the cigarette industry and coming from Richmond, VA (home of Philip Morris which seems to be like the company mentioned in the book), it was that much more intriguing.  Thrown in there are the usual Grisham-like bad guys.  The hero, though, is not a lawyer, but a jury member, Nicholas Easter, with a knack for persuasion.  With his girlfriend, Marlee, they are working to singlehandledly take down the cigarette industry.  Sound impossible?  Maybe, but considering all the legal issues that the cigarette industry has had over the years, it seems believable that there could be one case that would decide the precedent for future lawsuits.  The bad guy, Rankin Fitch, is perfectly evil and will do what he can to make sure that the tobacco industry is protected.  Some highlights in this book include humor, likable minor characters, and fast-paced suspense that makes you want to keep reading and reading.  While I did not see the movie and heard that it is not about the cigarette industry (but gun manufacturers instead - typical HOLLYWOOD!), I recommend that you read the book instead.  You will not be disappointed 
 An excellent look at what has brouoght the DRC to where it is today, extremely readable 
 This is one of Tiesto's best works... Though its still continues the ISOS 4's soft melodic trance, its a little harded though and upbeat... CD 1 starts off slow and up till track 5 (Fonzarelli - Moonlight Party) the beat seems to be building up, like climbing a mountian side... and then at track six (Leama & Moor - Everything Matters (Matthew Dekay Remix)) you can tell that its getting faster... and by the 5 th minute of this songs you are just expecting the peak and then you see it... or hear it.. and track 7 (Matthew Dekay Vs. Proluctors - Let The Game Begin) starts off with a trudging type beat (keeping it with the mountain climbing)... and in the middle you get to the peak (which is real tight) and then you decend into Karen Overtons Loving arms... and from there on its good music till the end... and cd two is great... more hype and hard... though the general pattern is the same, but it kinda builds up faster than cd 1... and i really don't get reviewers looking for the old tiesto and giving the cd a star... don't listen to em, they are just fat conservatives who are afraid of change... trust me... this cd is tight.. 
 There are four of them. Father, Mother and two sons. This is just one day in their lives.  Although there is no way of knowing for sure, you quickly get the impression that this day is not much different than yesterday or tomorrow. It's just another day of being a Tyrone. Trapped in their own mediocrity, the Tyrones do what most unhappy people do: Blame someone else. Mary blames her son Edmond for her addiction to morphine originally administered because of his difficult birth. Edmond and Jamie blame their career failures on their father's miserliness. Papa James sees his children as freeloaders and Mary as weak willed.  Despite their angers and finger pointing, each views the family with a good deal of love and reverence. Mary says it best. "None of us can help the things life has done to us. They're done before you realize it, and once they're done they make you do other things until at last everything comes between you and what you'd like to be, and you've lost your true self forever." There you have it. Long Day's Journey into Night is a snapshot of how it is to be held prisoner in a house of mirrors. Each mirror, is flashed at you by someone to whom you are bound, someone you love, someone you hate. You can deny all you want. You can argue that mirrors distort, but there is always another mirror. You could escape. Cut the chains. But, then what? This is your family. You're stuck. Bound to them. Trapped. When you are a Tyrone, there's only one solution. Only one thing to do! You get even.  
 This book gives a good insight to handling difficult people in any day to day situation.  Reading this book is a good aid on how to learn techniques to handle difficult people, as well to give the reader a  perspective to not take negative behaviour personally.  Being aware of common traits of difficult people gives the reader an opportunity to practice what they read, in the workplace or their personal life. This book is good general knowledge and if nothing else will confirm some of your feelings you have probably had when in uncomfortable situations with difficult people 
 I just order 2 cookbooks that I absolutely love and that I would recommend. The first one would be Lidia's Italian-American Kitchen, and Simple and Simply Delicious by Sylvie Rocher. They both have simple but delicious recipes. I thinking of buying those 2 books for my mom as a gift 
 Another great book from John F. Macarthur. In this one, Macarthur talks about how Jesus used twelve ordinary men for his disciples and used them to change history, and how he can do that in your life. "Hard to Believe" is also great. 
 The film was so much more enjoyable than "Brokeback Mountain". I really, really enjoyed it. Nuff said.... 
 Best courtroom drama movie I have ever seen.  Performances of Gene Hackman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are superb as father and daughter attorneys on opposite sides of an automobile accident case.  The story pits  big-corporation corporate attorney (Mastrantonio) against small-time  scrappy class-action attorney (Hackman).  But the highlight is the  intra-family dynamics between father, mother, and daughter, which are  superbly developed as the tension of the lawsuit case unfolds.  The  screenwriting is excellent, handling characters from attorneys to family to  scientists, plus powerful revelations in the final courtroom scene.  You  will say, "Wow" at the end 
 i've never been a type of person who like to read books, but i've allways liked vampires and when i read the book i  was toatlly amazed! the words were soo vivid and i felt like i was in the story.....i could picture the characters in my head as they were happening.... 
 I find that Sylvia....her words, thoughts and feelings resonate deeply with my own. Therefore I own most of her books and feel that her truth is my own.  I would urge anyone to have an open mind and heart and to read a book from her-- and see if she speaks to you as well 
 No doubt that Edelman is a very controversial guy--just check out these reviews. However, Edelman is also very knowledgeable and very accurate. He accurately called the Index Fund fallout as early as 1998. HE WAS WIDELY CRITICIZED FOR THAT. But as someone who listened to him, I am glad he was so perceptive!Likewise, Edelman suggests to carry a mortgage vs having a paid off mortgage and invest the difference. As another astute reviewer commented, this is a lot like the old term vs cash value life insurance debate. Which is better?Cash value is generally the better value for the insurance salesman. Likewise, a paid off mortgage is not doing you any good because it is a liability and provides no income. Better to put that extra mortgage moneyin good investments that can grow 20%-25% per year.Edelman may be controversial but his advice is right on 
 Where to begin? To put it as briefly as possible, if you're an adventurous music listener you will not be disappointed by Blueberry Boat. This is the most inventive work I've heard since Radiohead's Kid A. (No small feat). Every style you could imagine is carefully melded into one, including the most wonderfully bizzare lyrics I have ever heard. No sense discussing every track ad nauseam, each individual will form their own opinions. I can only give this my highest and most urgent recommendation.  Pay no mind to the impatient simps who give this album one star and call it "the worst of all time." Sit down with Blueberry Boat; listen to it as many times as you have to. Those who *get* this musical gift from the Friedbergers will fall in love. Give it a chance and you may be pleasantly surprised 
 I enjoyed this book very much. Others have described its plot so I won't repeat it. The book did not get 5 stars from me because there wasn't enough character development for me to believe the mysterious hero would involve himself in the heroine's cause so quickly. Also, I didn't get a good idea of what the heroine looked like, I couldn't picture her in my mind. But those are minor things - there was so much good to the book that I'm sorry it sat on my shelf for so long before I read it. The hero was sexy, the heroine driven, and the epilogue very satisfying. I would give it 4-1/2 stars. It's definitely going on the keeper shelf. 
 Songs of the Humpback Whale by Jodi Picoult is an amazing story of family connection and love.  One of the main characters, Jane, married Oliver at a very young age.  From the beginning, Oliver chose his work with humpback whales over his family.  When he announces that he'll be absent for their only daughter, Rebecca's, birthday, Jane snaps.  The story follows her and her daughter as they make their way out to Jane's brother and the thrilling and emotional aftermath.   I'm a HUGE Jodi Picoult fan and I have to say this definitely one of my favorite books of hers.  The characters are believable and are people you can easily relate to.  She writes in an interesting style.  Some people really really love it (like me!) while others aren't so crazy about it because it can get confusing.  It's unlike any of her other books.  There's no crazy courtroom scenes and you experience completely different emotions while reading it.  Expect a suspenseful book but not a thriller.    I strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for a warm, comforting story, especially to mothers and their daughters 
 Although I'm labeled "horror buff", I just had to write a review of this film depicting the life of famed Dr. Dian Fossey. Heads up to Warner Brothers for giving us a glimpse into the world of a woman who ultimately gave her life to save and protect the few mountain gorillas remaining in Africa. Dian devoted 18 years of her life to researching and understanding these wonderful primates. This film shows Dian's vunerable side along with her determined side to do what ever it took to save the gorillas who are supposed to be protected by the parks. Sigourney Weaver shines in her role and was the perfect choice for this movie. She approached it with reckless abandon. Although Dian lost her life trying to save the remaining gorillas, we get to see how one person was responsible for doing so much for the gorillas. With heartwarming scenes with her and her beloved Digit, to heartbreaking scenes like when she had to turn over Pucker, the infant gorilla she nursed back to health, to a zoo and the horrible death of Digit, this movie captivates you from beginning to end. For anyone who is interested in the few remaining mountain gorillas, this movie will really open your eyes and make you route for Dian. Although with a tragic ending with Dian's death and burial next to Digit, it's a true love story not only between her and Bob Campbell, but between her and the gorillas she loved so much. I wish I could give this movie more than 5 stars!!  Definetly a movie to own and to cherish... for her memory will never be forgotten as her work carries on thru The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International to this day 
 I am not a great fan of comic books and have never really been into them in any way. I have also not really been impressed by the movies made from the more popular comic book heroes, (though X-Men was very cool). "Superheroes and Philosophy" proved to be an excellent choice of read despite these issues for me.   If you are likewise someone who has never read a comic book, or does not have Daredevil Issue #134, don't worry! Even if you missed the movies, don't worry! The contributors to the book have written their essays in such a way that anyone can enjoy them. Also, some superheroes are such cultural icons that any familiarity with the comics or the movies is basically unnecessary. The essays quote some of the comic books, but even the most unfamiliar characters pose no problem due to the explanations given.  Another aspect that was notable is that not all of the contributors are philosophers in the strict sense. Some of them are working in the industry of the superheroes for the companies that publish the books themselves. Shattering my previously held mythical belief that people who wrote comics were just adults going through prolonged puberty, some these contributors made the most astute and detailed observations about their craft. I was singularly impressed with the reflections they made on their own work, and the characters with which they dealt.  Other contributors made their essays relevant by focusing on the challenges that superheroes present to us and the questions they raise over how we live life. Bringing the more personal element into philosophy as shown through various heroes drew the concepts into reality and made them less abstract and more "concrete". This was something this volume achieved more than other volumes that I have read in the same series.  Comic fan or not, this is a book that fits well with the high standard set by other books in the "Popular Culture and Philosophy" series. As the 13th volume, it makes a worthy contribution to the series and is completely recommended.   I thoroughly enjoyed this book and really gained a lot from it. All in all, a fantastic book that covers a large range of topics within the framework of a universe with superheroes and super-villians. I loved every page 
 Some people look on accounts of slavery as being only for black Americans to read.  This is untrue.  The horror and evil of slavery is something that every American should confront.  This is not to hang or condemn anyone.   Its just to say that a book like The Narrative of Sojourner Truth is  something that everyone should read.  I was at times stunned by Sojourner  Truths startling courage in the face of the evil she faced.  It was also  enlightening to read about the slavery of the Northern states like New York  and that so many people in that region still spoke Dutch even well into the  19th Century.  I was infuriated reading about the treatment of the slaves  but I also was inspired by Sojourner Truths dignity and strength.  Much  like the Nazi holocaust, slavery is a horror that must never be allowed to  happen again.  If everyone read books like this, we would be one step  closer to making that a reality 
 Tells a story of true life and real people, of trials and courage,faith and how God fits in 
 Having once had both the original Clef Records entire Tatum solo Masterpiece series, then both Pablo Solo and Group Masterpiece Series (they were stolen a long time back), I balked a little when I saw this billed as "The Best Of..." But I liked the tunes and the personnel, so I jumped, having no Tatum left. I was not at all disappointed. This is a fantastic re-introduction (or introduction) to the genius of this extraordinary pianist. And the sidemen - Buddy Rich, Louis Bellson, Benny Carter, Buddy de Franco, "little Jazz", Jo Jones - GEEZ -it took me a while to remember that all these were originally on the Group Masterpiece Series. This truly is a great intro to "The Best Of Art Tatum" along with sidemen. Try to get at least one Tatum solo CD. You will think he has overdubbed himself! What a talent 
 If you have read Asminov's Foundation series many eons ago, this is a must read.  It gives you an excellent idea of how everything started.  I read the Foundation series years ago and never read the prelude.  Since reading this I am reading the series again.  It is fascinating and as always Asminov touches on truths.  Anyone interested in Astronomy or any type of science for that matter must read this book and of course the whole series.  Amazon delivered the item as scheduled and it was in excellent condition 
 John Major Jenkins generously wrote an appendix to my book Tranceformers: Shamans of the 21st Century, that really added a remarkable confirmation to my contact with a "dead" optics physicist colleague, and his telepathic communication to me about our End Time scenario. Indeed it was his scholarship that forced me to seek my own scientific answers to these spiritual questions: Does God Exist? Who are we? Why are we here? Where are we going? After immersing myself for 15-years into the academic disciplines of astronomy, biology, computer science, genetics, mythology, physics, psychology, medicine, sacred geometry, and theology, did I finally find the Rosetta Stone that deciphered ancient visions into modern wisdom--as had John Major Jenkins but only many years previous to my musings. I learned from him that we are becoming fifth-dimensional beings of light with third eye open, telepathic, psychic solar powers. That, moreover, I saw too now what modern astronomers define as Solar Cycle 24, ancient Mayan (and Egyptian) astrologers called shaman-priests portrayed symbolically as the Eternal Return of the Sun of God. That the End Time is our golden window of opportunity for transformation between the Venus transits of our Sun in June 2004 and June 2012. Although his book is extremely uplifting in tone, I describe the visions that I have been given to share with my readers with respect for our need to prepare for the "shift of the ages" and the overwhelming natural disasters to come. A runaway violent and weird weather oscillation cycle that vacillates between global warming and global cooling with Super Oceanic Storms that these thermal tug-of-wars will generate worldwide. Also explained is the melting of the polar ice caps by increased galactic and solar radiation inputs to the core of our planet, triggering the eruption of previously dormant undersea volcanoes. This process will slowly build in intensity as Jenkin's knows too, as gravity wave movement coincides with the earthquakes and tsunamis that will be devastating our coastlines in the USA--and elsewhere around the globe as in Indonesia in 2004. I in fact saw that the eruption of Mount Rainier will be part of this lengthy list of geophysical change events as electromagnetic "symptoms" leading to the North-South pole shift quickens. Notwithstanding these sobering events, Maya Cosomogenesis 2012 is not about doom and gloom forecasts. My insights are simply the result of having my third eye opened to our "flexible" future, given that enough of us awake and create our world anew. At a minimum, John Major Jenkins has written a fact-packed intellectual survivor's guide and provided a map for all of us sojourners planning on surfing knowingly into the Age of Aquarius: The Water Bearer of cataclysmic yet miraculous Earth Changes.   Dr. John Jay Harper is the author of Tranceformers: Shamans of the 21st Century.  www.johnjayharper.com  
 Cleared of false charges that lost him his place on the Royal Navy's roster of officers and newly distinguished by his accomplishments as a privateer, Captain Jack Aubrey is awarded command of the frigate Diane. His first assignment is to convey his brilliant spy/surgeon/best friend Maturin on a diplomatic mission to the Malay prince at Pulo Prabang. The French are already there in hopes of securing a treaty that will all but doom British trade in the region. Maturin's wily machinations in the resulting intelligence battle are a joy to read. Further adventures - an untimely typhoon and Maturin's trek to the sacred crater of the Thousand Steps deep in orangutan country - combine to make this thirteenth book one of the best in a series that the reader by now wishes would never end.   
 ... in close third-person by Clay, a 30-ish comic book illustrator who is in Boston, closing a deal to get published.  He's on the street when suddenly everyone starts going nuts and killing each other.    He and other unaffected "normals" figure out that a pulse sent through cell phones across the world turned all the cell phone users into violent zombies.    As civilization quickly crumbles, Clay hikes through Massachusetts and New Hampshire, trying to reach his hometown in Maine to see if he can save his young son.    Among the many vivid characters he meets are Tom, a gay man with a keen sense of irony; Alice, a brave high school girl; Jordan, a computer whiz; and Jordan's crusty old headmaster.  Chillingly realistic in this modern age of terrorism and anarchy.  Unputdownable 
 This is at least the second time that Crais has left his main subject (Elvis Cole) to take a side trip. The first was Demolition Angel, which I highly recommend. The title of The Two Minute Rule comes from the idea that a bank robber has to get in and out of the bank in two minutes or less, since two minutes is the minimum amount of time the police need to arrive at the bank once the alarm has been sent. This book features Max Holman, a bank robber who, on the day of his release from prison, finds out that his estranged son, a policeman, has been murdered.  As with Demolition Angel, Crais demonstrates a deft touch with damaged people, making them sympathetic in spite of their flaws. I noticed a couple of the reviewers thought the book started slowly, but that was not the case for me. The opening pages were busy, since Crais had to lay a lot of groundwork for what followed.  All in all an excellent read 
 Everyone has read this, and its easy to understand why. One of the best written books about Wall Street ever, Michael Lewis is superb as he goes about describing his experience at Salomon Brothers during the 1980's as a bond salesman. Introduces us to the legendary trader John Meriweather before he started Long Term Capital Management 
 I had never seen the anime before, but I was at a book store and saw the manga, so I got it. I really liked it! It was really funny. It's hard to imagine that this crazy story came from the same mind that created Neon Genesis Evangelion. The two stories are so different! The art was a little hard to follow at times, kind of confusing. And you shouldn't read it when your tired... ^^; (I know from experience...) Otherwise, I enjoyed it a lot! And will probably end up purchcasing the second volume sometimes too!  I would definetly recommend this book to you! It is really funny and enjoyable. It's definetly worth it 
 Actually this film really deserves 10+ stars! I first saw this movie on pay per view somewhere in the later part of the 90's and you know how there are really only a few titles to great flicks that you can actually remember? Put it this way, 9 years later I still never forgot "My Family" The cast is wonderful & the acting couldn't be better. It reaches into the soul of the heart and is one heck of a film that you'll never forget.. 
 This is not an overall review, however, I want to let everyone know how the Tier 2 supplements protocol affected my eyesight.  It took me a couple of weeks to notice that I was no longer wearing my glasses all the time.  The effect was dramatic (only 2 weeks!).  My eyesight is improved, and I am using another book containing vision exercises to improve it even more.  I do not find eyesight mentioned anywhere in the book, but this is one of the benifits I am reaping 
 As the family who has adopted a child we have found this book to be  helpful in understanding her position. We are very interested in helping  other people deal with similar situations and wonder if the book has been  translated to Spanish 
 I found this book very informative and useful. Greg Dean really knows what he is talking about. There are sections on how to deal with hecklers and how to handle the microphone. Not much else to say except that you should get this book if you are serious about doing comedy 
 I had expected EXILE'S return to be more of a straightforward history of the Lost Generation, and was somewhat surprised to find instead a profoundly insightful, exceedingly well-written reflection on Malcolm  Cowley's literary generation.  As a result, many writers that we associate  with that decade, e.g., Ernst Hemingway, receive almost no mention, whereas  others, e.g., Hart Crane, get a considerable amount.  The highest praise  that I can bestow on this book is that in looking now at the poetry and  literature of that period, I feel much more at home in their world than I  did before reading Cowley.  A marvelous book in man, many ways 
 I Love This Book!!  I love it so much that I have purchased 6 copies, 5 of which I've given to others that I know stuggle with weight issues.  I am on this site today to purchase several more.  This book helps by showing where to focus.  So many times we agonize over the symptoms or results of our issues, but never face & address the issues themselves.  This book will guide you through a journey to not only face issues, but to make empowering decisions to overcome them. The book is based on sound Christian, Biblical principles.  If used sincerely and prayfully this book can help you to not only transform how you look, but also transform your life 
 Energy=Hot Hot Heat! this album is full of it, though not just in the album as well as on the stage these four performers pour their hearts out to you and sweat as the play their instruments. With catchy melodies thougout the album, though fast that you have to look at the lyrics to see what exactly he says, you'll be sure to enjoy this alternative' dance album that makes any kid that thinks he/she is to cool to dance, Dance!!, that is all Hot Hot Heat makes you want to dance, besides that, they also have other songs like "elevator" and "jingle jangle" to tone down the album. This whole album comes from all of the emotions of a gone band member, but newly found one, being a great addition, and being in love. So to dance and sing get this album. 
 This is a good translation of St Augustine's 'Confessions', one of the most important works of Christian and also world religious and philosophical thought.  St Augustine's genius needs no advertisment.  His brilliant intellect is more or less the founder of Western Christianity as we know it.  Between St Paul and Aquinas, he is the most brilliant theological and philosophical mind the medieval period managed to produce.  If Western philosphy is a cathedral, then Augustine is one of its capstones.  The Confessions is a personal narrative of Augustine's life, which describes his spiritual and intellectual journey from childhood to adulthood.  Augustine is such a brilliant writer he manages to capture countless facets of experience in a book which itself is only about 340 pages long (thirteen books in total) and this work also has immense range and depth, from the strange nature of free will and sin to the inner quest for the indwelling image of the Trinity, to Augustine's mystical experiences, to his dramatic conversion, to his allegorical commentary on Genesis to his ceaseless praise of God's goodness and the beauty of creation.    Augustine is clearly influenced by several sources, especially Neo-Platonic Philosophy.  Augustine read the Enneads of Plotinus in translation into Latin (thanks to Marcus Victorius, a Christian convert from Neo-Platonism) and found its concepts of God made more sense to him than that of the sect he was a member of, the Manicheans.  The Manicheans, a syncretic sect who blended Buddhism, elements of Christianity, Zorastrianism and Gnosticism, and Platonism captivated Augustine for several years, seeming to provide a satisfying explanation for the baffling problem of evil.  Yet Augustine, after reading Plotinus, thought the explanation of evil in terms of non-being made more sense than God making an evil world, or being ruled by an evil principle.  In this sense Augustine made a crucial breakthrough in theology, not only by finding God 'within' the depths of his own soul, but also in associating God with the Platonic Good.    Yet Augustine's strongest influence is the Bible.  References to the Bible abound far more than references to Plotinus, and for Augustine, pagan thought is mostly useful for articulating truths already main plain by the Word of God.  However, Augustine is always too brilliant and original thinker to merely fall into a rigid pattern of dogma he never leaves (in contrast to many more mediocre minds in the Christian tradition) and reworks his theology consistently and constantly in a creative manner.    However the Confessions is too brilliant and profound a work to summarise in one review, and it is best if readers avail themselves to a copy of this work as soon as they can 
 I have read many of Truman Capotes short works and this collection is my absolute favorite. I saw the movie "Breakfast at Tiffany's" as a child and fell in live with Audrey Hepburn. Later I read the book and realized that it was even better than than the movie(forgive me Ms. Hepburn). These characters will be etched in my mind forever 
 I frequently use Juran and Gryna's Quality Control Handbook as a reference for my work and writing. It is a comprehensive reference for many issues in quality management, quality control,  and statisitical process control.  There are excellent discussions of quality as "fitness for  use," and the true costs of poor quality.  If you plan to take any of the American Society for Quality  Control's certification examinations, this is a good reference.  I used it for the Quality Engineering, Reliability Engineering,  Quality Management, and Quality Auditing exams, and it served  me well in each case.       -William A. Levinso 
 Actually, more like New Year's and Christmas, as that's what this DVD features.  The story begins with an opening segment in which Pooh Bear hides a present he has for Piglet. Then our friends gather together and tell little Roo about a past Christmas. This segment comes from the special "Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too," featuring the characters from "The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh." Pooh and his friends are getting ready for Christmas. They decide to make a Christmas list and come up with all sorts of gifts that they want to give each other. But when the list is lost to the wind, Pooh and Piglet decide to dress up as Santa and a reindeer and make gifts.  Later, they recall a New Year's in which Rabbit wanted to move away because he was irritated Pooh's eating honey, Tigger's bouncing, Piglet's being afraid and Eeyore's gloominess. So they all made resolutions to change and swapped personalities.  One reason this production is neat is that it has Gopher in it --- he really isn't seen too much lately.  This movie features songs by Carly Simon (who also did the songs for the more recent "Piglet's Big Movie" and "Heffalump Movie") as well as by the characters. She does a great job, as always. The best is "Auld Lang Syne" (with Pooh-specific lyrics mixed in.) This is great, because you don't usually get to hear lyrics for this song these days, only the tune.  DVD special features include a "Covered in Snow" game, a "New Year's Eve" countdown and song selection with on-screen lyrics. These features aren't anything overly exciting, but they are fairly nice. The "Covered in Snow" game is a bit flawed in that you're supposed to choose objects, but it lets you choose the same ones over and over and doesn't progress the game any. Otherwise, good game. You can also put the DVD in your DVD-ROM drive (if you have one) to register it 
 I am in my mid 30's.  I am not a Britney fan at all.  I received a department store sales flyer in the mail a few days ago and it had a sample of Fantasy in it.  Out of curiosity, I opened it and could not believe I liked the scent.  My husband and I are both picky about perfume.  I decided to order a sample size off of Ebay before buying the full monty - because the last perfume we both really liked was Sensi - but it made my husband sick after a bit.  Well, I got it yesterday and I still really like it.  I am shocked the sweetness that it starts with does not give me a headache.  I think I will buy a full sized bottle once my sample is gone 
 Having read the book first, I was pleased that the DVD gave a vivd description as in the book......the actors were superb and fit the story perfectly. 
 These are very comfortable shorts and I hardly feel as if I have them on 
 In Applied Strategic Planning, the authors give a comprehensive step-by-step guide to conducting applied strategic planning. They clearly demonstrate organisations' need for strategic planning. The book is different from other strategic planning models in some significant ways. The major differences are in the values scan, organisational culture, strategic business modelling and integrating business and functional plans. The authors emphasise the importance of application considerations and environmental monitoring as on-going processes throughout the planning period. The authors produced a high quality book that is an important reference source whenever I need to undertake strategic planning.   The book provides the reader with an overall understanding of the process of applied strategic planning and the required steps and technology for using the model in a strategic planning process. The strategic planning model covers application and implementation from the inception of the plan to the post-implementation phase, making it very practical.  The model involves nine sequential steps as well as two continuous functions, namely environmental monitoring and application considerations, that are involved at each of the sequential phases. The sequential steps are planning to plan, followed by values scan, then mission formulation followed by strategic business modelling. Performance audit and gap analysis follow, these two being different aspects of a single phase. The last three phases are integrating action plans, contingency planning and implementation.     I read the book because I would like to increase my proficiency in and knowledge of practical strategic planning and to sharpen my consultancy skills. The book is very practical and easy to follow. As a consultant, I should be able to use the methodology in the course to manage the planning process.  Applied strategic planning provides an appealing model for transforming organisations.  The model is future focused and leadership driven. It involves all people in an organisation. It produces a plan that is detailed, comprehensive, understood and accepted, and has the potential to generate energising force to drive the transformation of an organisation.  After going through the book, I feel confident that I could act as a consultant for any organisation.   
 In some ways KM Soehnlein's THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS reminded me of the teenage novels of Paul Zindel.  There is that same depth of feeling along with characters that can break your heart and make you laugh at the same time.  Zindel wrote specifically for adolescents.  Soehnlein does not have those restrictions and has written a brutally honest book about homosexual experimentation among post-pubescent boys and its social implications.  Although the book is written for adults, it speaks on a deep personal level to the adolescent in all of us.  THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS is the story of a family that falls apart when a tragic accident befalls the youngest child.  The story is seen through the eyes of the victim's 13-year-old brother as he tries to find something to hold on to while his mother drifts into alcoholism, his father goes nuts, his sister becomes a religious fanatic (and a kleptomaniac) and he finds himself smitten with two boys.  One is Todd, the athletic and arrogant brother of his girl-pal confidante who lives next door.  The other is Scott, a boy who deals drugs, cuts school and has an alcoholic father who beats him.  All the characters are vividly rendered.  If this were ever turned into a film, the actress who plays the mother would probably win an Oscar just for her final scene in the car.  This is powerful and emotional writing.  I found it very moving.  It's tempting to want to recommend this book to a wide audience, but I am reticent because there are several scenes of furtive and unacknowledged sex between teenage boys that could upset some people.  But I will never forget this book.  Five stars 
 The Pilgrim's Progress is the 2nd most famous book in the world. John Bunyan is a genious and the arguments in the book are very convincing and hard to deny. Anyone who believes in "free will" would be turned around if they read this book. It clearly explains that we do not choose God, He chooses us, or rather, he CHOSE us before the foundations of the world. Everything in his book is scriptual and I love it 
 For starters, let me say that I very rarely write reviews for Amazon. However, I feel like I needed to say something to offset some of the negative reviews. Everyone has a different opinion of what constitutes a good book, but some reviewers seem to imply that the enjoyment of this book will be raised or lowered dependent upon your intelligence and/or age.  I read fantasy for one reason, to escape the realities of life. I don't read fantasy in order to develop a new way of thinking. It's a book! The content has been written by an author with different experiences than mine. She has made up a story so that I could wile away an afternoon (and frequently most of a night) lost in another world.  Several reviewers have commented on a lack of morality, stilted dialogue and/or cardboard characters. Whether or not you agree with those statements will always be a personal matter.  I notice that most of the reviewers recommend that I try George R. R. Martin because he apparently writes intelligent fantasy. Well, I have tried to read GRRM and couldn't bring myself to finish. The violence was incredible...horrific...even nightmarish...and that was just the first part of the book. Ugh! I know, I know, I am among the small minority that fervently wishes for less sex, less violence, and less language. This book is surprisingly free of foul language, has a minimal amount of violence (that fits within the flow of the story) and just enough romance to make your heart beat faster.   I hope that I have given you a reason to give this series a chance. I will not compare this series to Tolkien (what can?), but I do not feel it is the drivel that others have implied. I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the other reviews and I was pleasantly surprised to discover I enjoyed it. Now on to the rest of the series 
 This movies is soooo great ...and Im not even gay! I bought this movie after constant repeats on Cinamax while I and a friend were drunk and on not so legal drugs  we ordered this move because of its greatness. Crawford is a hero to us all! And Stig ia the most perfect and classicx of all movie villians. This mo0vie is one ofnther greatest movies ever made...move over Citizen Kane here comes real cinima!!!!!!!!!! 
     Unlike  "Hell to Pay" and "The Truth About Hillary", two BOOKS about the former First Lady and current senator, Tom Kuiper's "I've Always Been a Yankees Fan" is not a book, but merely a collection of quotes.  Of course, it is a very amusing, entertaining, and sometimes downright scary, collection.  Hillary Clinton has always had a sort of "ice-queen" aura about her, and some(fine, I'll be honest, ALL) of what has been recorded in this book only enforces that same image.  What she's said in anger over her husband's affairs, what she's said about anyone who disagrees with her on anything, even what she has said that would classify as Anti-Semitism, has been collected by Kuiper.  What really stated the case for this collection of quotes was the cover, emblazoned with the title-"I've Always Been a Yankees Fan"- but just under those words was a photograph of Clinton wearing a Chicago Cubs cap!  Flip-flop? Don't think too hard.  It is obvious that she said she was a Yankees fan when she thought it would help her public image, and said she was a Cubs fan when she thought that would help her public image.  This is clearly the result of political motivation.     At times, however, "I've Always Been a Yankees Fan" can be long-winded and repetitive, especially with its use of pictures.  Over and over, I saw pictures of President Clinton embracing Monica Lewinsky; pictures of Hillary's calculating glare; even pictures of Bill with a fat cigar protruding from his mouth.  Also, for someone to truly appreciate this collection of quotes, he or she would be advised to read up on some of the events that took place during the Clinton years (not just the years of the Clinton Presidency, mind you), such as the Whitewater scandal.       "I've Always Been a Yankees Fan" could possibly become the holy grail of anti-Clinton rhetoric, a tool used to damage her prospects during the 2008 campaign.  For her admirers, on the other hand, circling the wagons in response to those who criticize her political talk would not be surprising in the least.  When Bernard Goldberg released his scathing "100 People who are Screwing up America(and Al Franken is #37)" Jack Huberman wrote a response titled, "101 People who are Really Screwing America(and Bernard Goldberg is only #73)".  Hardly original, but I'm sure someone out there will compile a response to this- possibly a collection of quotes from a leading Republican who may have high hopes for 2008.      Kuiper's collection presents to the reader a cold image of the New York Senator that is all the more damning, frankly, because it is entirely in Hillary's own words.                  
 I have season one thru season 4 and season 4 is the best of the series.  The cast has matured and so has the episodes.  Even though I had heard Johnny Depp did not really want to be there he does a great job with his character.      
 This book totally captured my interest and held me spellbound.  It is well written, easy to follow, and provides the background of the events surrounding the decision to build, the naming, and the construction of the Taj Mahal.  The author has judiciously balanced the description of the characters and their relationships with the actual historical facts, providing the reader with both a rich literary experience, and a history lesson.  It is a timeless story of love....... deep abiding love of a husband and wife, and a father and daughter.  
 Worth reading. A great book. I believe Mary and life after death 
 This is a collection of dozens of folktales culled from the Gullah tradition.  They are mostly from the mid to later part of the 19th century from the coastal lowlands area of Georgia.  The hundred + year-old tales are transcribed in a dialect, but they shouldn't be considered authentic renditions of the Gullah creolized language.  The book has a great introduction that explains how Jones came to compile the work and write other books on a range of subjects.  The dialect of the stories take a while to understand, but the glossary at the end of the book helps explain unfamiliar words.  The stories are really good ones, and it is great to see this important book in print 
 This book is another winner in the Chicken Soup collection.  It's a second helping of touching, witty and wry parenting stories that I could relate to.  It's also a fast, fun read that I could easily do between naptimes and carpools. Debbie Farmer, parenting author of 'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat 
 Karen Koenig has done it again. Written a lovely book for people with an uncomfortable relationship to food. The Food and Feelings Workbook assists the reader to separate out eating for nutrition or pleasure from eating to drown feelings. Eating-challenged people (my words), she says, grow up in an atmosphere where feelings are taboo, where they were taught by example that it was not okay to express even the smallest bit of anger, disappointment, or sadness. Instead, they were taught to push it under the rug and in our culture, a great way to do that is with food...too much or too little.  Koenig has organized this convenient workbook into sections that reflect 7 difficult feelings: guilt, shame, helplessness, anxiety, disappointment, confusion, and loneliness. She uses "Stop and Feel" questions throughout the book to help people exercise those seldom-used feeling muscles. She includes "Change Boosters" to practice new behaviors about feelings and eating. So, she gets you practicing this new skill, which you've avoided all your life. And she does it all with her usual wit, personal style, and generous helping spirit.  An example of her writing that I particularly like is from the Introduction: "This workbook...will encourage you not to bury your emotional pain until it turns into a toxic waste dump,but to put on your hip boots and slog through it, detoxifying one emotion at a time no matter how long it takes."  As a life coach and psychotherapist, I've recommended this book to clients who are slogging through it slowly...the way it needs to be used...and starting, little by little, to live with their feelings, rather than continue their obsession with food, weight, and body image. 
 I began reading this book thinking that I was going to read only a few chapters.  Yet, I found that I could not put the book down.  Rabbi Angel does a wonderful job at describing the environment of Turkish, Spanish, and Roman Jewish interaction and the effects on their spiritual life.  This work goes into many of the cultural nuances that place because of internal and external situations such as the inquisition in Spain and Portugal, the Sabbatai Svi movement, and the decline of the Ottoman Empire.   I really enjoyed how the book explained both the good and bad that resulted from the increase in Qabbalistic thought.  He also covers the traditions, poetry, and music that came out of the Ladino culture.  All and all, this is one of the best and most straight forward books that deals with the need for Sephardim to preserve the culture.  I think this book should required reading in all Yeshivot and Jewish schools 
 tongue diagnosis in this book gave me a lot and in the best easy way that can be explained in such a complex way of diagnosis.it began with a history of the tongue diagnosis, that followed by a short explanations of the  diffrent ways of diagnosis through all the chinese dynasties,but the method  that represent here in this book is the most practical comprehansive yet  simply and gives you the reader a more deep understanding and diagnosing of  this art of diagnosing,for instance:while some tongue diagnostics used (in  the past mainly)to observe only by the color,and some others by the  shape,some on marks on the tongue, this book explains what are the meanings  of each one of them, and how they can be worked together in the  diagnosis.the method that are used in this outstanding book is the one that  can be detected and aproved by clinical tests,and i as a  orthomoleculr-nutritionist that use the basic of the knoledge of this book  in order to have a wide veriety of diagnostic tools can say in a very  confident way:it is simply true and the best book on the subjecy 
 I read what I feel is an erroneous vocal comparison to Robert Plant.  If you know your music, you would hear the voice of Marc Bolan from T. Rex in Jeff Buckley's tragically sweet and haunting melodic sound.  But make no mistake...in a world rife with reproductions, Jeff Buckley had his own authentic sound.  On the other hand, if you're trying to describe Buckley's sound to someone who has never heard his music, then I can see the value of trying to cite the sound of an musical icon from a bygone era...but at least choose the most applicable iconoclast to make that comparison 
 Season 8 includes more amazing South Park episodes with topics that remain relevant and fresh.  Every time South Park comes out with an incredible episode, I think they have reached their zenith and every time I think that, they prove me wrong.  Their take on steroids using the Special Olympics as well as their coverage of Walmart and Michael Jackson are new highs.  Every season since season three (which, on a whole, I don't really care for) has gotten better and better.  Here are the episodes from Season 8:  "Good Times with Weapons"--The boys buy martial arts weapons at the county fair and dive into the world of anime.  In a showdown with Professor Chaos, Kenny gets carried away and throws a star blade into Butters' eye.  The boys are afraid they will get grounded.  In the end, the town is more concerned when Cartman's naked invisibility powers malfunction.  "Up the Down Steroid"--One of my favorites.  Cartman thinks if he pretends to be mentally challenged, he's a shoe-in to win the Special Olympics.  Meanwhile, Jimmy wants to win so badly he is willing to use steroids.  Mark McGuire, Barry Bonds, and Jason Giambi make an "appearance" to symbolize that kids should never cheat (yeah, right).  Classic, I love the part where Cartman "trains" to be mentally challenged and when he tries to complete in the events, but the Jimmy beating up his girlfriend bit was a little much. "The Passion of the Jew"--Boy, is this all of a sudden relevant again.  Cartman convinces Kyle to watch The Passion of the Christ and Kyle is so traumatized, he begins to question his faith.  Cartman then organizes a movement reminiscent of something that happened in Germany 70 years ago.  Meanwhile, Stan and Kenny try to get their theatre ticket money back by confronting Mel Gibson.  The Gibson scenes are way over-the-top. "I Got F'd in the A"--The boys get "served" by Orange County dancers and the adults seem to care more about the situation than the boys.  When Stan's dad teaches his son to dance, Stan serves up the other kids and "it's on" (whatever). "Awesom-o"--Another one of my favorites.  Cartman pretends to be Butters' personal robot to get dirt on him, but when Butters lets it be known that he has video of Cartman in an embarrassing situation, Cartman has to play robot longer than he expected.  Soon "Awesom-o" will be used by movie producers to come up with film ideas and be the object the government wants to convert into a weapon. Great scene:  when the movie producer asks "Awesom-o" if he's been programmed to pleasure humans.  "The Jeffersons"--One of SP's all-time best!!  Michael, uh, Jefferson and his son Blanket move into South Park but Kyle is concerned Mr. Jefferson "just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one."  Mr. Jefferson thinks everyone is just "ignorant."  Great scenes:  Stan's dream (yuck),and "Got your nose."  The music is good, too. "Goobacks"--People from the over-populated future come to the past seeking employment and blue collar workers from the present protest that these "goobacks" are taking their jobs.  These workers have a solution: to turn gay so as to stop future generations. "Douche and Turd"--PETA is forcing South Park Elementary to change their cow mascot.  Kyle and Cartman compete with two different write-in candidates.  Stan does not see the point in choosing between a giant douche and a turd sandwich; not even Puff Daddy's "Vote or Die" threats will persuade him. "Something Wall*Mart This Way Comes"--What's up with that title?  Wall*Mart comes to South Park and everything changes, especially Stan's dad, who goes a bit mad. "Pre-School"--A tough kid the boys betrayed back in pre-school and had sent to juvenile hall is out on parole.  "Quest for Ratings"--The boys' school news show is getting smoked in the ratings, so they need to jazz it up. "Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset"--All the girls want to be like Paris Hilton.  Wendy does not think Paris is a proper role model but, when she is ditched by her friends, she is about to give in.  Mr. Slave saves the day by competing with Paris in a whore-off. "Cartman's Incredible Gift"--After being in a coma, police detectives believe Cartman has developed psychic powers to identify serial killers.  Of course, many innocent people are arrested as a result. "Woodland Critter Christmas"--Now this story is twisted.  Stan helps a group of animals prepare for the birth of their savior only to find out they are devil worshippers.  The last line of the story is hilarious 
 This is an excellent book. I recommend it for every Christian, and for those interested in the roots of Christian history. Basically, the author gives us a glimpse of life in the first century. From the four voluntary associations in roman culture to what a person would experience in daily life to how religion was understood in ancient times, this book gives great insight into understanding key concepts and he relates those concepts to Scripture, showing how certain passages reflect a particular theme in society. This is not a theology book, but a book to educate people about the environment that the Scriptures were written in. The author also describes some common fallacies modern people have about life in those times. For example, he explains how the catacombs were not secret Christian meeting places and that the romans had profound respect for the dead (in general). But that Christians organized as burial associations. He also shows the patron-client relationship in culture and how some of that type of relationship is expressed in Scripture. And perhaps one of the best features of the book is a detailed history of the major cities in Biblical times and notable facts about them. All in all, this book is good reading. I recommend it highly 
 Van Morrison never ceases to amaze me.  If I knew I only had a very short time to be in the physical body, I would want to hear Van every day until my last.  I love this record... it's some of his toe-tapping feel-good stuff mixed with his very true Irish influenced tunes.  Definitely the greatest songwriter to ever grace music... as much as I love Dylan, no one, and I mean no one, can deliver a song more beautifully than Van Morrison!  Be still my beating heart!

 This is a real page turner.  At over 350 pages the story is fully satisfying. The action is non-stop and the characters wonderfully drawn. The main characters exude a warmth that I found utterly endearing and I didn't want the story to end.  This is a perfect read for the beach, or on a long airplane trip or an evening at home.  It is nominated for a Golden Crown Literary Award www.gclscon.com  This from the publishers site - A space adventure filled with suspense and a daring intergalactic romance.  When fired upon during a space journey, resolute Commodore Rae Jacelon of the Gamma VI space station apprehends a stunning, but decidedly lethal, Gantharian woman fleeing from her home planet together with an unusual young boy. Kellen O'Dal is prepared to cut any deal or commit any crime to carry out her duty and keep the child with her.   Having lived for her career in the Supreme Constellation, a vast union of planets, Rae risks her future and offers Kellen a solution with unanticipated ramifications. High-stake power games among bitter planetary rivals further complicate the unexpected attraction that develops between the women. While the powerful Council debates how to take advantage of the politically explosive situation, Rae and Kellen embark on a dangerous mission to save the child, and ultimately, each other.  
  The book came quickly and in great condition.  Would use this seller again 
 Ah, the Baby Boomers: We ain't Heavy, we're your brothers and sisters, and  children, and parents, and grandparents, and the big fat undigested rat in the middle of Social Security's Ponzi Boa Constrictor. Or is that rat really pariah/piranha? Starting with a quote attributed to Herbert Hoover: Blessed are the young, for they shall inherit the national debt, Christopher Buckley's self-mocking latest political satire lampoons Boomers ("the UNgreatest Generation") and the impending impact of our  retirement on the Social Security Administration; "Boomsday" being the term used to designate the date when the first of the US's 77 million Baby Boomers begin to retire with full Social Security benefits.  What if this somewhat self-indulgent bunch were offered incentives to "solve" the problem of our malingering on the system? This is Buckley at his introspective, politically incorrect, farcically follied best.  /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer PS: You CAN judge THIS book by its snazzy cover. That red cloud in which the title radiates, is actually a cut-out hole in the sun-rays of the cardboard cover.  Groovy!!! 
 Stewart asserts that "male masochism was a rhetorical strategy through which men asserted their cultural and political authority paradoxically by embracing the notion that they were (and always had been) wounded and suffering." A bold claim which the author largely backs up with reference to the works of von Sacher-Masoch, Freud and Wagner, showing that, in her words, "masochistic scenarios, whether in literature, music, the visual arts, or medicalized diagnoses of the fin-de-sicle malaise, stage the male as one who submits to an aestheticized and eroticized gaze and voice." More or less exactly what I feel when I enter Milady's dungeon for a brutal flogging 
 This is a great survival guide thats packed with information. I bought one for my 12 year old nephew who is a boy scout and loves camping. He was thrilled. It has tons of info on many aspects of camping and outdoor/nature stuff. I have one too, but haven't had time to throughly go thru it. 
 Voight is spot on in this superior suspense and intrigue film. I missed this when it was released and had only mild expectations for it, but once again, I am pleasantly surprised to find another underrated gem. Previously, I thought Deliverance to be my favorite Jon Voight appearance, but The Odessa File allows him to give a sustained excellent performance as a German journalist uncovering facts too disturbing to set aside. Don't let the unlikely Perry Como Christmas song over the opening credits put you off. You'll soon be pulled into a "hunter as hunted" mystery of convincing authenticity. Jon Voight is perfect for the role. Evidence to his terrific performance is that his character must "play" an older Nazi. At that point it becomes difficult who's doing the better acting: Jon Voight as the German journalist, or his character portraying the Nazi. Then it becomes obvious that whatever is the correct answer, Jon Voight wins! Still,I would rate it his SECOND best work, considering that not long after Odessa File was released he was producing Angelina Jolie 
 Let's be straight. This is a book full of real people's sexual fantasies. It's not guided by some moral code the world imposes on us, nor is it subject to the same code when being read. It is individual's fantasies. Escapism, exploration of the mind where boundaries have no place. The reader is supposed to have reactions evoked, because some of what happens within a world of fantasy is so outside the real worlds acceptability that when looked at form the real world, it seems alien, and stimulates our ingrained sense of right or wrong. It gives an insight into the women who've contributed psyche, often how women as sexual beings have been repressed by the world around them, and unable or unwilling because of their confines to rebel in the real world, have conjured in their minds elaborate and amazing ways to escape mentally, which in turn, has enabled the conscious self to accept who they are, and apply their OWN morals and values to their lives, rather than ones given to them by their parents and religions and upbringing! An uplifting book for those who aren't afraid to explore themselves 
 I picked this book, because I read "The Da Vinch Code" and I wanted to check out other Dan Brown books. I actually bought the small paperback and after finish reading it, I found out that there was a Special Illustrated Edition of this book, and I had to have it! Because when I was reading the small paperback without the illustrations, it was hard to imagine the places.  I wish I knew about this Illustrated Edition. I loved it! In my opinion, "Angeles and Demons" is better than "The Da Vinch Code". I have heard that "Angeles and Demons" is going to be a movie. If it's true, I could hardly wait. And I hope it's not going to be like the movie version of "The Da Vinch Code" 
 I love it. Very nice watch! A little bit heavy, but this is the way I like watches, and the price is not that bad.  
 I saw this movie a few months ago on an import dvd. I do have to say, the movie was great.Brad Renfro plays  Mark ,a rebelling boy, who knows something that he don't have to know. Susan Sarandon plays a lawyer who helps Mark. She did it great. Tommy Lee Johnes plays a Lawyer who want to ask Mark what he saw. You must watch it.. 
 All the great hits I remember from Paul Revere & the Raiders.  Really enjoy this CD 
 Smerconish is an intelligent, thoughtful talk show host who writes an intelligent and thoughtful book. If you can get past the media hysteria over racial profiling--Smerconish is only suggesting that we return to the use of common sense in airport security.Ignore this book at your own peril 
 This is a great book, contanis many color pictures and excellent information. I recommend you to buy this book. It's perfect!! 
 This book ranked 22 in the best books of the 20th century.  It's there because you haven't heard of O'Hara and he has been improperly ignored, just like Arthur Koestler at #8, so this is one of the efforts to make the list hipper, and quite frankly, it's a pretty hip list.  Granted, this is a good book.  Most of the characters behave like normal people behave, but books aren't like movies.  You didn't have to wait until 1967 for a decent one to get made.  There have always been accurate pictures of humanity in literature and O'Hara was writing at one of the peaks.  No wonder he wasn't recognized as a leading light.    While many of the characters are lovable for their recognizability, you have a lot of time taken up with gangsters that seem fairly ridiculous and have no real bearing on the plot, what little there is of that.  And in terms of plot, there are two endings that are not allowable in an introductory writing class:  1. It was all a dream, 2.  The ending that O'Hara chose.      All that aside, this book does a good job of taking us away from kings & queens and the grandiose moment.  Caroline's sexual development is fantastic and demonstrates the haphazard path that love takes place when the subject itself is taboo.  It's good to get O'Hara on the list, but I can swing a dead cat in this room and hit 22 books better than this 
 The Pythagorean Proposition collected 367 proves is very special book.this book collected math.&history of human cultures 
 Great product, especially when you need a sterilized bottle in a hurry 
 This novel based on Mexican revolution takes you to the start of this century and allows you to live some revolutionary scenes and gives an idea of the way the fight wa 
 After reading McLaren's first book, A New Kind of Christian, I knew that I had to continue on and ordered this book as well as the third book in the series.  McLaren does an incredible job of drawing the reader in to really knowing and caring for all of the characters.  I found myself identifying with many of them and, at times, had to stop reading for awhile to let the new thoughts settle in. The content was stimulating yet easy to consider and ponder because of the narrative/fictional style. I would advise readers to try to read it with an open mind.  I thought this was every bit as good as his first book and will probably read it again and jot down notes.  It left me feeling hopeful and connected. 
 A VERY TOPICAL BOOK FOR THE PRACTICING MANAGERS WHO ARE IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY. AUTHORS HAVE USED A VERY SIMPLE LANGUAGE TO BRING OUT THE CONCEPTS, DELVED THEM WITH SOME GOOD EXAMPLES THAT MAKE SENSE, AND HAVE OFFERED SOLUTIONS. MOST PEOPLE ARE SO BUSY AT WORK, WITH ROUTINES, THEY FORGET THE FUNDAMENTALS AND THE NEW DIMENSIONS AND THE DYNAMICS. THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF THIS TEAM OF AUTHORS IN THE FORM OF THIS BOOK, WILL BE A GREAT HELP IN INCORPORATING THE SIX SIGMA CONCEPTS, MEASURE UPTO THE CHALLENGES OF TIME THE TRANSACTIONS AND SERVICE INDUSTRY IS CURRENTLY FACING,  AND IMPROVING THE BOTTOM LINE. THE OVERALL PRESENTATION OF THE BOOK IS VERY GOOD AND THE PUBLISHERS - MCGRAW HILL, AS USUAL HAVE DONE WELL.  THE AUTHORS NEED TO BE CONGRATULATED FOR DOING SUCH A FINE JOB. 
 THE SUIT IS FAIRLY WELL MADE FOR THE PRICE, HOWEVER BE FORWARNED...IF YOU ARE A SMALL ORDER MEDIUM OR IF YOU ARE A MEDIUM ORDER LARGE. SIZING IS ON THE SMALL SIDE. IT DOES WORK WELL 
 This CD started it all. In 1984 it introduced the then little known Arvo Pï¿½rt to a new western audience. Pï¿½rt had long before made his "tinntinnabulation" discovery (around 1976). Before this pivotal epiphany, the majority of Pï¿½rt's work fell into the serialist category. His early work shows all of the grinding atonal experimentation of the 1950s. It thus lies in stark contrast to his later work as presented on this CD (he shares this same evolutionary path with the Polish composer Gï¿½recki).  "Tabula Rasa" introduced a new music and a new style to the west. This music doesn't follow traditional harmonic or melodic forms. Listening to Pï¿½rt differs from listening to Sibelius or Stravinski. In Pï¿½rt, environment and setting are everything. The melodies and harmonies function to set a mood rather than to follow a path or a harmonic progression leading to an ultimate resolution. Subsequently, one experiences rather than listens to Pï¿½rt's work. The notes merely provide the structure. In this way Pï¿½rt's pieces represent frameworks for music (which probably explains, as related in the CD booklet, why the members of one orchestra asked "where is the music" upon seeing the score for "Tabula Rasa"). So Pï¿½rt not only presents beautiful and moving music but also helps listeners conceive of it in new ways.  The tracks on this CD provide the perfect showcase for Pï¿½rt's work. Beginners should start here. Two versions of the meditative "Fratres" appear, but each utilize such different arrangements that they sound like two separate works. "Cantus" remains one of Pï¿½rt's most moving compositions. It sounds like a slowly exploding wall of catharsis. The nearly half hour "Tabula Rasa" features incredible violin work and prepared piano (a la Cage). Overall, the mood of each piece on this CD veers strongly toward the meditative, mystical, and ethereal. As such it serves as a great introduction to the "late" Pï¿½rt and as a showcase of incredible musicianship.  Pï¿½rt remains more of a phenomenon on CD than in the concert hall. The lush rich sound of this CD, which will have your cochleas swimming, provides some evidence as to why. Not only that, the amount of quietude and silence utilized by Pï¿½rt must create difficulties for orchestra hall performance. Pï¿½rt's music, intimate and close, probably plays best in seclusion or in small venues. For the maximum experience, put on some headphones and listen to this CD. In this way listeners can experience all the subtle harmonics and nuances that make up the music of Arvo Pï¿½rt 
 This book is a must read for anyone interested in demographic stock market trends from the early 1900's to present.  His analysis of the coming boom in the stock market, specifically the large capitalization equity markets, is both insightful and mesmerizing.  The author does an excellent job in showing demographic/technology driven market cycles and how they CAN be forecasted accuratly. He manages to do it in a way that keeps the reader interested and makes some startling comparisons to the roaring 20's stock market boom and the last great boom cycle that we are currently experiencing.  Harry S. Dent proves that the baby boom generation will change the world we live in and the economic market conditions for decades to come.  When you read this book, these economic cycles become both exciting and frightful. This book is highly recommended and it is hard to put down 
 This is a really nice little toddler sneaker. It slips on and off easily  thanks to the big velcro flap on the top of the sneaker.  The sides have little make believe tires and the sneakers flash every time the child takes a step. They are of excellent quality, and sturdy enough to last till they are outgrown. My grandson absolutly loves them 
 A classic is back in print and the new materials show Polsky to be at the  top of his game. Bravo! The work will likely influence yet another  generation of sociologists--who will be delighted to find that keen  observation, critical thinking, thoughtful analysis and fine writing need  not be mutually exclusive. Students have always enjoyed this book as much  as their professors have been proud of having assigned it. I'm glad to see  that this tradition will continue 
 It's like reading a written out lecture. It's a very easy read and there are very few actual examples of work. It's a topic based `talk' in written form that walks through some of the basic areas where `veil work' is performed. It is a very broad discussion ranging from scientific `proof' of magic through topics like posession.   A great amount of general information and opinion is presented on each subject. To that end, it was very disappointing to see that on some topics, on which volumes could be written, it was summed up with only a few statements or pages. In a book that basic, I was also rather suprised to note that one of the subject in which the most instruction was given was posession.  I have ~12 years of magical experience ranging from tree huggin' Pagan to ceremonial paths. Nothing in this book was anything new to me. That said, it was a refreshing lecture that put several subjects in context with one another and added some tidbits of examples here and there that I had not heard before.  If you are fairly new to witchcraft (about or less than 5 years exp), and have ever wondered exactly WHAT `the veil' is or what some of these more advanced practices are, this is a great book.  it would be an excellent launching pad for further exploration.   If you are an advanced practitioner, you are not likely to get much out of it - except, as I mentioned earlier, a refreshing one sided conversation about topics you are probably already familiar with. 
 I recently purchased this package. The books along with the dvd and a lot of practice will get you were you want to be. I was considering lessons since I am a beginner. I may in the future. After owning this product for a total of five minutes.  I have put off my lessons, no need until I find these routines and theories easy.  Very Satisfied.  Thanks Bill Edwards and Amazon.com for a great description 
 After multiple Ludacris albums, a Disturbing Tha Peace group album, and Shawnna's solo debut, I-20 dropped his debut album, "Self Explanitory."  1. Eyes Open (Intro)  2.

The main issue is I-20's hooks.  If he had some better hooks, the album would have gotten ranked way higher.  His voice can get annoying sometimes too but that doesn't mean he doesn't have skills 
 This is an enlightening book about how important we mothers are in our children's lives.  It teaches us that we need to stand back and observe and enjoy each and every moment we have with our children, for we never know what tomorrow will bring.  It helps mothers realize they can only do their best and not expect themselves to be perfect.  I think it also is a great testament that, however difficult it may be to work out,  mothers need to stay home with their children 
 This book is truley a Christmas blessing.  It is filled with joy and love bringing the most precious gift Jesus Christ as the center of Christmas.  It  provides so many ways to share Christ with others and make Jesus the center of our lives in our own home during the hustle and bustle of the season 
 The authors furnish a good introduction to the main aspects of actively using digital audio. By this, I mean more than merely listening to it. The book is directed not to an audio professional, but to someone who comes at this as a layman. Hence the general discussion about sound waves and recording this in a digital manner. What you should appreciate is that once stored as digital data, a whole panoply of software techniques are available to be used on it. Your special effects, as it were.  The book skims lightly over the various digital audio formats. Just enough explanation for a broad understanding. Other chapters then take you into using common audio packages and the burning of CDs and DVDs. A full run-through.  All of this should be readily understandable 
 I have been waiting for years for this album to be remastered on CD.  I grew up listening to this album every Christmas season and it brings back many fond memories.  It is definitely a must have for lovers of jazz guitar.  This is Burrell at his best! 
      The book essentially covers similar topics that were covered in my adult education issues class such as:  academic freedom; issues facing higher education in the twenty-first century; the states and federal government and higher education; external factors and their impact; students, colleges and society's interconnectivity; financing higher education; technology and higher education; graduate education and research; and multiculturalism. 	The chapter entitled, "Technology and Higher Education: Opportunities and Challenges for the New Era," (P. J. Gumport & M. Chun, 1999), offered a cautious, uncertain view of the future of technology in higher education. Certainly, technology has had an impact already in higher education as a "tool" or delivery mechanism. The social organization and nature of teaching and learning as a profession had certainly been affected by changes in technology. One of the most visible changes has been witnessed in virtual higher education. No longer is distance a hindrance in obtaining a college degree. 	The authors' stress that the only prediction that can be confidently made about technology is that is will have an impact on higher education and it will be far-reaching. No single answer is available as many uncontrollable external factors such as societal forces will affect the technological futuristic outcome. 	The basic structure of the book was in four parts: "the setting" which covered the dimensions of change in higher education; "external forces" which shape and control higher educational institutions; "the academic community" discusses the profession's changes and stresses; and "central issues for the twenty-first century." Each of the four sections of the book contains several chapters which discusses each general topic with different flavors of expertise. 	I believe the editors were successful in their attempt to organize the information and chapters in such a way as to delineate key issues affecting American higher education in the twenty-first century. Each chapter provided a clear and concise representation of the topics listed. 	This book was an easy read for students who wish to find out more about particular topics without reading a whole book on each individual subject. The editors selected pertinent topics to higher education that could be read quickly to grasp the general concepts. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on technology and the potential implications for education. I've already witnessed significant change in this area as what was business education, i.e., typing and shorthand has already evolved into the computer applications area. It will be fascinating to see what's ahead on the horizon.

 This is an excellent shorebird guide -- and not just for beginners. I bought this guide for a specific purpose:  I lead tours in a wetland refuge and wanted an easy-to-carry guide I could use to show pictures of birds to people on the tour. This book fits my needs perfectly, but many others should find it useful. It is small and easy to carry. The book uses photo illustrations:  I believe photos are better than paintings for depicting shorebirds since silhouettes are so important for shorebird identification and it is hard to get the proportions exactly right in a painting. The photos in this book are excellent. Shorebirds can vary greatly in appearance because of plumage variations. This book has multiple photos of most species and does a good job of depicting the plumage variation. This book is less comprehensive than some larger guides, but since it is designed as a beginner's guide, it wouldn't make sense for it to be too long and complicated. An excellent little book 
 In a movie jam-packed full of actors who have gone on to acclaim, director Ang Lee presents a dark winter in the suburbs during an ice storm.  The movie perfectly captures the look and feel of the 1970s-even the pacing seems completely appropriate.  The characters are in the middle of a sexual revolution-married men and women are having clandestine and unfulfilling liaisons, teenagers are experimenting, and the hipsters in the neighborhood are holding a wife-swapping "key party."  All the action comes to a head during a tragic and dangerous ice storm.  This is a dark drama and a brilliant commentary on the human condition 
 Dee is now living the fabulous life. Once overweight and unhappy, thanks to gastric bypass surgery, plastic surgery and a great job she's starting to enjoy life a little more. She still won't forgive her ex-husband who cheated on her even though he keeps bugging her about it. She's enjoying her new image and wants to enjoy her life to her fullest. Unfortunately her two 30+ year children don't seem to share this idea with her and constantly bicker with Dee blaming her for their parents' breakup. Plus Dee's new clients are not the easiest bunch to work with. Then just as there is a new guy in the horizon, Dee is forced to work with her ex on the project! This definitely puts her new faith in Christianity to the test.  This was a really fun book to read. I enjoyed reading about Dee's business with all the movie stars. Loved the costume ball sequence with Patrick Swayze. I also enjoyed that the person who had kept doing wrong to Dee finally got found out and punished, without Dee extracting her own revenge. I also liked since Dee is new Christian, she is eager to share about her faith but she knows not to blast it out to people when they feel uncomfortable. She's still mostly the same person though, feeling insecure about herself and hoping that plastic surgery will ease all her troubles away. I enjoyed the fashion, shoes, clothes talk in the book. It made it more fun for me to hear about designer names even though I will never be able to afford them! Dee's a very likable character and the reader constantly wants to cheer her on. I felt that it was also very realistic to show that society was treating Dee better just because she was skinnier. Yes Christians are suppose to love everyone, but it's also truth that looks ARE being judged in society. The only thing I didn't like was that I felt the ending was a little too tidied up. I honestly didn't see why she had to go back to Lyle. Yes she should forgive him, but that doesn't mean she can't be angry with him. He lost her trust, she didn't have to take him back. I know he became a Christian but I would have liked to see him at least become more spiritually mature before Dee took him back. Other than this, this book is highly recommended. It's targeted for the baby-boomer set but I believe anyone who likes a fun chick lit book will enjoy this one at any age 
 I see lots of reviews here curmudgeonly dissing Ken Burns "Baseball" for what it is NOT rather than what it is.  For a baseball fan who doesn't mind the film's devotion to teams of New York it's a slice of heaven.  It's futile to condense 18 hours of screentime into a few paragraphs, but it's worthwhile to note a few things I feel are wonderful about the film.  The entire opening "inning" (the film is divided into 9 segments of 2 hours each) is devoted to the origins of the game - both as a game, then as a game played for money.  The widely held misconception that Abner Doubleday "invented" baseball is taken apart immediately.    Burns spends a lot of time documenting the historical and social context of where America was as a country at the same time events were occurring on the diamond.  In that way he presents the perspective that baseball's single greatest moment was the day Jackie Robinson walked onto Ebbett's Field with "Dodgers" across his chest.  It's useful for us as people to not only appreciate the baseball achievements of Jackie Robinson and, later, players such as Willie Mays and Hank Aaron, but also to acknowledge the widespread racism and outright barriers they had to overcome that their white counterparts didn't even have to consider.  He similarly contrasts virtuous players with non-virtuous ones.  In inning two the film triumphantly reports the victory of mild-mannered Honus Wagner's Pirates over hated Ty Cobb's Tigers.  It's a little disconcerting how little time is allocated to recent years - most "innings" cover a decade, but the most recent 24 years of baseball (1970-1994) are covered in a single disc.  Since that is the time most of us are most familiar with it's easy to feel a little slighted.  If you think baseball is just "some game" this film is clearly not aimed at you.  But if you love to talk about baseball and to hear stories of towering home runs and crafty pitchers - "Baseball" is like a long love poem to the game 
 You may be asking yourself: What ever happened to Edgewater? Afterall, in 2004, they debuted with a rather impressive and accessible album by the name of "South Of Sideways." They were labelmates with some big name acts like Seether, Finger Eleven and Evanescence, and their record label, Wind-Up was pushing this CD so hard, you could buy it for a price in the single digits in some stores. It seems they had everything all lined up. A great sound, great connections. Unfortunately, Edgewater never quite reached the heights of stardom like some would have predicted.  Fortunately, however, the band is still around. In fact, they are in the process of releasing a new CD by the name of "We're Not Robots," as can be concluded by their rather cryptic homepage. As for "South Of Sideways," their debut, this is simply a solid mainstream rock effort. I have to say that every song on here is good, with "Eyes Wired Shut," "Break Me Out" "Lifter" and "Sweet Suffocation" being the cream of the crop. It's a bit odd that this band never got the attention that they deserved, but at the same time, it isn't surprising. These guys sound a lot like other new bands of the time, such as Lo-Pro, Strata, Crossfade, and so on and so on.   Edgewater did and still do have a great sound, but part of what drags this debut a bit is the fact that there are no surprises. The band hardly covers any new ground, and you can bet you own a few CD's that can be likened to this one. Maybe now that they are free of a major label, they can develop a sound that is a little more fresh and challenging. In the meantime, "South Of Sideways," despite it's originality issues, is still a worthy listen and recommended to all who love a solid melodic modern rock sound 
 Claudine, a brilliant film with two great legends, giving a great performance, in a story from the our black history. This is a classic of black films, and its on DVD

 This book has been a very handy reference. The Greek myths are presented in plain English, and written in chronological order, so they can be enjoyed separately or as a single, unbroken narrative. Citations from numerous sources are given after each story. Robert Graves notes even minor variations on each myth, and the notes that follow give some of the historical basis in which the myth may be rooted. Well worth the cost 
 It simply is my most used book. I started just reading it, beginning with the elaborate introduction written by Easwaran. It gives an extremely insightful picture of what sort of person Buddha was and how important and inspiring he was in his own days. The translation itself is more than just a modern and appealing translation. I think the spiritual wisdom of Easwaran gives this translation an extra value. Every chapter hs its own introduction, which enables the reader to understand the text a little better than he would without it.     
 This is just a really sweet book about twin sisters & their family.  I wish things were still the way they were in this book.  I would love to have known more about Fanny & Sue's lives.  Hopefully this author will keep more coming 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and it would be an excellent addition to any library where one would find other film adaptations of Shakespeares works.  It does help to have an idea of Hamlet, and I would recommend reading or watching any version of it before this film or you can get a bit lost.  It gives a new spin to the play and makes you see the play through the eyes of two of the minor players, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  However, it is nonetheless an enjoyable film and will only add to your enjoyment and understanding of Hamlet.  
 When it comes to a movie about the Holocaust, you know you are going to get something emotional.  Spielberg does a good job with this as you follow characters and their motives.  Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, a war profiteer, who slowly becomes emotionally involved with the Jewish people that he employs.  This transformation is key to the movie and is what makes it more than JUST a Holocaust film because it goes beyond the obvious.  Ben Kingsley also does a good job, playing a Jewish accountant named Stern, who also risks his life in smaller ways to help other Jews while at the same time deying odds and remaining alive.  But I think it is Ralph Fiennes that makes this movie powerful.  His depiction as Nazi commandant Amon Goeth will shock you while at the same time you feel that it is so utterly real what he is doing.  Tommy Lee Jones, who did a good job in the movie The Fugitive, SHOULD NOT have beat Fiennes for an Oscar for best supporting actor.  Fiennes will captivate you when he's on the screen, although you are not supposed to like him or his actions.  I enjoyed the black and white although I think it still would have been powerful in color.  I think there were parts that moved kind of slow, but all in all, this movie will make you think and it will open your eyes to a brutal reality of the Holocaust.  It's easy to see why Spielberg called this movie "the most satisfying experience of my career."  I also recommend The Pianist with Adrien Brody and the HBO series Band Of Brothers, which also deals with similar themes 
 I like the pictures in this book.  The book made me wonder what goat-water stew and guavas are.  I wonder if people still live on Montserrat since the volcano erupted.  I wish I could go there to swim, fish, and visit the market.  I am 6 1/2 years old 
 I am by no means a mathmatician, but I have to say.  Del presents quite a case.  I am always hopeful that someone will come up with convincing evidence that the bible is divinely inspired and not just "penned by a human".  I'm convinced,Del! There are others who have reviewed this book, that believe he isn't credible because his method is incorrect. With so much at stake why would someone go to all the trouble & PAIN.  I truly believe that those nose-thumbing mathematician jockies should at the very minimum, LOOK INTO IT.  But I guess these individuals lack courage (the balls) and are afraid of "what their collegues might think".  OR maybe they have their heads so far stuck in their pocket-protectors they can't think for themselves.  To me, there is more than enough evidence that says beyond coincendence the bible was not fabricated by man.  NOTE:  It takes as much faith to be an atheist as it takes to believe the bible is GOD's word.  The Evolution THEORY has NOT been proven; therefore it is not FACT! The masses just have faith that is fact! What a pity! How ironic 
 works as well as can be expected.  i picked up 24 digital channels (8 in HD) on the first try just outside of chicago.  i sometimes have to adjust it to get a steady signal, but it usually doesn't take much.  as cheap as it is, it was worth a shot for me, might be for you too 
 Don't be put off from buying this series because it doesn't rate as high as "Casebook" or "Return", or the fact that Jeremy Brett was very sick and his performance wouldn't be up to snuff!! It is every bit the equal of "Casebook" and I personally like it more. The Dying Detective and the Mazarin Stone are two of my favorite episodes, and I own all 36!! Cardboard Box, Superb!! The Three Gables is probably the weakest of the six, and it is still outstanding. Brett is somewhat bloated, and his energy level is clearly waning, but he manages to pull it off because he is such a superb actor. Edward Hardwicke, great, as always. God bless these two guys, and I won't forget David Burke, the other superb Watson. I Thank all the people at Granada Television for creating these 4 series. I will treasure them forever!! 
 This has proven to be a wonderful way to start our day! One or the other will read it aloud and the insights have been great and we really like the writers.  I purchased one for my daughter and her husband and they are enjoying it as well.  This is my first Daily Word book and I am going to look for one just for women 
 This was an excellent book, well-written and informative.  Using Buffalo Creek as the fulcrum, Erikson provides readers with a good introduction of communities and trauma.  It is interesting to note the similarities and differences between the aftermaths of Sept 11 and Buffalo Creek.  Erikson's book is a must read for social scientists and anyone interested in creative non-fiction writing 
 I do not know where else in history that we have a people disposed from a land for two thousand years, scattered all over the world, who reconvene through an international movement and regain their homeland.  I also can not recall any group suffering the violent and irrational hatred of so many nations as the Jews have.  Lacqueur's history traces this unique movement.  It's success was very fragile; the many decisions from world leaders could have gone much differently if made a few years sooner or later.  Jews did not initially support it broadly; many prefered assimilation to their country of birth and some felt that the growing socialist movement provided a better answer to anti-Semitism. Even within the Zionist movement political infighting was strong.  Yet the worst fears of those seeking a refuge from growing European anti-Semitism did not forsee the scope of the Holocaust, exterminating 6 out of 7 Jews in Europe.  This emboldened the survivors and motivated just barely enough world sympathy to formulate the creation of the Jewish state.  The reaction of the Arabs was neither surprising or unique in the course of developing nations.  Lacqueur has the advantage of hindsight to examine policy mistakes and examine how it could have been different, but concludes the difficulty would have remained regardless.  This examination shows Zionism not as a righteous holy ordained movement,  nor is it a an evil racist colonial movement as the modern Arab media prefers to portray it.  It was a politically and diplomatically unique solution to a very serious and unique problem.    That the success of the Zionist enterprise has not yet yielded the peace they so desperately seek, makes this work only an introduction, but a valuable source to those seeking to understand the volatile Middle Middle East of the 21st century.  There are many more chapters to be written 
 I recently purchased Entourage Season 3, Part 1 from a BJ's Wholesale Club on 3.6.2007 and as it seems it's not supposed to of been sold until April. This dvd is Amazing, and don't be worried about it being a part 1. This dvd box set pretty much leads right up to the next episode that will be aired in April it has 12 episodes on the discs just 2 episodes short of the amount on Season 2 Box set and 4 more than the season 1 box set. This show is amazing 
 Normally I can't stand the reissue but when it comes to Sonic Youth, you gotta let it slide.  You have the record in it's remasted entiretity along with all the B-Sides from the "Goo" era of Sonic Youth.  The liner notes are a nice touch.  The Gem here is Disc 2... The demos of the songs that make up Goo.  To see what the songs started as and to what they became is an amazing listening experience.  What you want to do is listen to the demo and then the actual album version from Goo back to back and check out the care and craft that Sonic Youth goes into making a record.  You hear these rough recordings and you get to see behind the curtain.  That alone is worth the price of this 2 CD set.   This should tide you over until the next Sonic Youth release... or maybe a Dirty reissue??????? 
 Flesh-N-Bone's sophomore album was released in late 2000, following his release from Def Jam and the start of an eight year jail sentence. That's too bad, because "5th Dog Let Loose" is really a good album, head and heels above his 1996 solo "T.H.U.G.S." Flesh, the often forgotten member of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, has a very unique flow, being one of hip hop's quickest tongued rappers and his delivery is great to listen to, with a great high pitched voice. Once you are able to decipher his triple-time rhymes, you will find entertaining stories of crime, spirituality, and his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio. He has a darker style than Bone usually does as a group, often referencing dark scripture and mystic spirits and such. I find "5th Dog Let Loose" better than "T.H.U.G.S.", which I thought had a lot of good material but was sometimes plagued with too much filler and dated sounding production. I had heard that this album was not great, so even as a Bone fan I was reluctant to check it out, but I'm certainly glad I did. Damon Elliott and company definitely stepped up the production for this go-round, and I find it easier to follow Flesh's lyricism on this album as well. I definitely recommend "5th Dog Let Loose" to all Bone fans, because this is some of Flesh's best work.  Following an overly-long intro, the album starts with "Hero", a dark and entertaining song, definitely a highlight. Next comes one of the best, a Montell Jordan collaboration called "Amen". The beat samples OutKast's "Git Up, Git Out" and Flesh speaks of the struggles of life and provides hope. Montell's appearance adds well to the song and it's a very strong cut. "Way Back" is also a great song, featuring his brother Layzie Bone. He reminisces over dead rappers, namely Eazy-E, the Notorious B.I.G., and 2Pac. I also really like "If You Could See". The production is very unique but I like it. Flesh is aided by Wish and Layzie Bone, another very good track. "Word to the Wise" is a tough warning track, reminiscent of some on "T.H.U.G.S." "The Master" is excellent, it sounds like a song Krayzie Bone would record, another album highlight. "Say A Little Prayer" is an introspective and spiritual track, it shows Flesh's versatility and has good production too. "Havin' A Ball" sports probably the best beat on the album, it's a unique strings-and-bass production. It's a happy song, I really like it. "Kurupted Flesh" brings west coast veteran Kurupt for a guest appearance to make a surprisingly conscious and relevant song. "Deadly" is awesome, the production has great droopy bass and even a harmonica. "Come F**k With Me" has an excellent chorus and more great production. "No Other Like My Kind" is a nice track, and the BG Knocc Out collaboration "Silent Night" closes the album on a tough note. It seems like a fitting sequel to their first collabo, "Coming To Serve You".  Overall "5th Dog Let Loose" is an impressive album, definitely the best work Flesh has ever pulled off by himself. Damon Elliott definitely stepped up the production, and the album shines. I recommend it to all Bone Thugs fans, because it showcases a different style but has a lot of the same appeal 
 Each year I get an updated copy of Novel and Short Story Markets because there are always new opportunities found within its pages. The one thing I wish they would include but haven't yet is the e-book marketplace. Currently it is only if a major publishing house includes e-books among their releases that this shows up. Granted, they have e-zine markets, but I'd like a bit more for e-books. For those not interested in this grantedly small market, the book is an excellent source. I will continue to update my copy each year 
 Ones' home is one of the most important factors in ones health, I believe.  Todays houses are filled with toxic chemicles that slowly (sometimes quickly) erode the health of the occupants.  Paula Baker-Laporte knows from first hand experience how a home affects its occupants - she herself has suffered from chemical poisioning in houses.  As an an architect, she is sharing her years of research and personal experience with the public so that they can also live in a healthy home.  This is a book that everyone in the civilized world should read.   It is well written and filled with great information 
 This was a great book and it gave me a great "plan" to follow in educating my children about the catholic faith and it also provided great ideas on family projects that we could do to celebrate and understand the deeper meaning of many catholic customs and traditions 
 I think you have to see this movie a second time to fully appreciate it.  There is alot of subtlties that I didn't pick up on until I watched it again years later. All the acting was fantastic.  A standout performance for the actor who played the "salesman" at the hotel.  Weird-a-rama!!!  The movie ends up being completely freaky and surreal, and ya got to have a warped mind to fully grasp the surrealness of the Coen Brothers.  Strange-a-rama......... 
 I just finished reading this book, and must admit how much I LOVED it!!  This is the first art-related book I've ever read that was totally inspiring, honest, and thoughtful!  As a person who is pursuing a career in fine art, I was moved by how Dorrell so honestly shared his experiences, both the failures and the successes.  It made me realize that I must never give up on my own journey 
 Leblanc does a fine job in this book laying down the evolution of Fem-punk. She, unfortunately, doesn't consider much of the homosocial and homoerotic behavior of her male-dominated punk culture and, therefore, losses out on a great possible extension to her study. The book relies, at times, too heavily on interviews with female punks. Leblanc doesn't do too much consideration about the Birmingham school. Again, this weakens her arguments. Overall, I think that this study was very insightful at times but often drifted away from subculture theory 
 My sister and I each bought both of Georges' books.  They are both very informative.  We liked his easy going way of doing things.  His program is easy to follow and his recipes are also easy to make.  We have made several of them so far and all have been good.  Especially like his muffin recipes and the lasagna is very tasty, didn't even miss the noodles.  My sis really likes the baked zucchini fries 
 Mystified by money? Using a crystal ball to plan your retirement? Burdened with credit card debt? Lacking health insurance? Budgetless? With humor, charts, user-friendly quizzes, and common sense, this book will prod you into taking the small steps needed to get a grip on money. Your money. Earning it, keeping it, growing it. You'll find the scoop on a broad range of financial topics, sprinkled with quotes from the likes of Confucius, Dear Abby, Mark Twain, and Erma Bombeck. Discover ways to put brains and muscle into your personal money management. I found each chapter to be clear, motivating, specific. A great gift 
 My mom read us this book as part of our family reading night.  We loved it and were extremely disappointed when she would stop each night.  We liked the book so much that we named our dog "Huppy" after the puppy in  the story 
 Okay I'm not sure about the pets. But this is a great story, I love kids stories like Wolves of Willoughby Chase, books by Edith Nesbit (The Enchanted Castle) and Tom's Midnight Garden. I especially old fashion books like this one. The children are charming, their adventures full of wonderful characters like the grouchy uncle and the cheery gardener. Their search for a missing family is touching and sweet, and in the best of traditions, ends well with a hint of sadness.  I love the beautiful passages in this book - "It was a small silver bell, but it rang out in a marvellous manner, clear and sweet and loud, as though it were ten times its size, and echoes woke up in the house and answered it, ringing and ringing away and away like birdsong in the wood." The whole book is not like this, obviously, it's quite readable. But there are enough gorgeous passages with beautiful descriptions - I especially love the old-fashioned food and frequently force my husband to listen to my ravings about it 
 Ann Coulter has proven she's a savant at self promotion. She's attractive, has a rapier wit, and she's quite aware that spewing drivel will improve the sales of her book. What I find most entertaining is the sheer volume of readers who believe that she believes the flotsam she's put on paper. She's the Jerry Springer of the conservative right and is laughing all the way to the bank. Concerning some of the other comments regarding the book: people who would love to convince you that it is impossible to believe both in God and Evolution, apparently never had the opportunity to dissect a cat. And who knows, maybe all that shared DNA between humans and chimpanzees was because God was a little short on new material and decided to use the odds and ends he had left over. I make casseroles that way... so why not? Buy the book and Ann Coulter makes more money. That would be insult to all of the incredibly wonderful organizations that could use your money this holiday season.  But, go ahead and pick up a copy at the library. It's worth the read and clever. It's also nonsense. That doesn't mean it's any less entertaining.  
 I'm a originally a turkish women who loves very much American Country Music. Mark Chesnutt is the best artist in the country music. His amazing voice and style make me listen his music over and over again. I love him so much. For about three years in a row I went to his concert.He is an exceptional,fantastic musician. God Bless him,his family and his band 
 I first heard sleater-kinney on rock angainst bush 2 and what immeadiatly struck me was how impressive the band's skills were. the lyrics are great, and in someways harken back to alanis morrissete's 'jagged little pill.' i LOVE light rail coyote. a definate must have for anyone who considers themselves an indie- or alternative rocker 
 I saw this on the telvision specials and it is hilarious. Dave Attell is very good and Sean Rouse and Greg Giraldo are descent good, but Dane Cook (which why I'm sure people view this at first) is great. New material from Cook makes this awesome, as he goes on about the Price is Right and Parties, etc.) As long as they dont screw up the format or content of the DVD, this is awesome 
 This book is a great introduction to the history of Japan, as the liner on the back of the books says. It suffers a little from the obvious problem of trying to squeeze two thousand years of civilisation into 370 pages, and as such is basically a fleshed out timeline. There is little elaboration on events and presents the reader with an endless string of historical characters, places and dates. However, there is a good focus on the development of the arts in each period. It would seem the authors have a great liking for Japanese verse, so the seemingly often appearance of poetry excerpts can get a little annoying if one is reading it purely for historical information. The book also glosses over recent Japanese history, from about the beginning of the occupation by American forces. As a turbulent time, there would be a lot to write about but if you're interested in that, try John Dower's "Embracing defeat" or a number of other books on Japan's modern history. If you are planning on making a visit to Japan this may be a good book to read so that you know when "that castle" or "this temple" was built, by whom and why 
 Mint Conditons songs-old and new- make me melt. They remind me what love is. I love that "Pretty Brown Eyes" remind me that I am beautiful and I don't have to be 'blond and blued eyed' to be that. My teenage years were made up of romantic ballads from this album. If you want a trip down memory lane, this is a great drive 
 Wow! reading this book and reflecting back on much of the culture brought up from back in the days really had me feelin' this book. Although I didn't agree with all of the authors views in this book, he did bring some insight and depth to some things I really never thought of. As a whole this book was great...everything from graffiti to music buisness to hip hop moguls to politics...for real...read this book 
 Great fun; really enjoyed watching the movie after many years.  Special effects are the best 
 As a regular person, I would suggest reading Dante with the help of some sort of commentary, maybe cliff notes or something like that.  The summary at the beggining of the canto is good but to fully understand it, the cliff notes are great, so enjoy...and keep me updated 
 I've been reading the "Alex McKnight" series by Steve Hamilton since it started back during the late nineties with a Cold Day in Paradise.  The books have always been more character driven than action, which enables the reader to get to know the protagonist on a more intimate level, thereby making the series more fun to read.  So far I've enjoyed each and every novel that Mr. Hamilton has written.  I have to say, however, that the newest book in the series, A Stolen Season, steals the show.  I started out reading fifty pages a night.  Then, I got midway in the novel and something happened to the main character that forced me to stay up all night and finished the blasted thing.  There was simply no way that I'd be able to sleep, knowing what I did.  I had to find out what happened next even if it meant going a day without sleep.  On one level that's what good storytelling is all about.  On another, I wanted to literally grab Mr. Hamilton by the shoulders and shake him until he explained why he'd done such a tragic thing to our hero, Alex McKnight.  Yeah, I know.  It's only fiction.  Still, when an author writes well-developed characters, the readers slowly begin to care for them as if they're close friends.  In fact, I almost want to say that while the novel is being read, the characters are every bit as real as the people who live next door.  Maybe more real, if you're a hermit like me.    A Stolen Season starts out on two fronts.  On the one end, Alex McKnight unintentionally gets involved with some unsavory characters when he and his friend Leon save three guys in a boating accident from drowning.  It later turns out that the guys are mixed up in some illegal drug trafficking between the United States and Canada.  Because something of value was lost during the accident, the guys think that either Alex, or one of his friends, have it.  They start putting the pressure on Alex, and he immediately begins to hit back, not realizing the caliber of people that he's dealing with and how dangerous they are.  Alex will underestimate the guys and ultimately find himself standing on a bluff with a handgun pointed at his face, waiting to die.  On the second front, Alex's girlfriend, Natalie Reynaud, has moved to Toronto to do undercover work for the police department there.  Her job is to get close to the girlfriend of one of the most terrifying men that she's ever met and to hopefully break up a ring of gun smugglers.  Something eventually happens that brings the two fronts together, driving Alex McKnight to the edge of despair at the tragedy that has erupted in his life.  His blood brother, Vinnie, helps him to gradually recover.  It's only then that Alex decides to paint his face red with his own blood and to go to war.  From that moment, Alex is on a personal mission to kill anybody who was involved in the tragedy that has changed his life forever.  He no longer cares if he lives or dies.  His only purpose is revenge.  God help anyone who gets in his way!  What can I say?  A Stolen Season chilled me to the bone with what happens to Alex McKnight.  It was totally unexpected and stunned me in a way I haven't experienced very often with a novel.  I'm still dealing with it even as I write this short review.  As usual the writing is excellent, the suspense is nerve wracking, a lot of people end up dead, and the story ends sooner than you would like.  The author has already stated in his newsletter that it's going to be awhile before the next "Alex McKnight" novel.  I had to wait two years for this book to come out, and now I have to wait another two years for the next novel.  This is definitely cruel and unusual punishment from an author I have grown to like.  I will say that Steve Hamilton has created a series that's every bit as good as anything James Lee Burke or Robert Parker has written.  Once you get started on one of the "Alex McKnight" books, you'll want to read them all.  No brag, just fact.  This is a fantastic series that I highly recommend to anyone who's the least bit interested in great writing and a fictional hero that stands out with the best in literature.   
     I thought Chicken Soup for the Sports Fan's Soul was excellent. I enjoyed reading the large amount of insightful stories. My favorite story in the book is "Best Seats in the House" by Barney Cohen, which was about his season tickets to the New York Giants NFL football team and how important they were to him and his family. Reading all of these stories made me want to write about my athletic experiences like all the people did in this book. I learned more about famous athletes and what they do outside of sports and in the community. Such as the story in this book "Stadium Nights" by Bob Greene. It was about Michael Jordan and how caring he was. He had a conversation with a young boy in a wheel chair instead of anyone else in the paparazzi and also made sure one of his extremely disabled fans who had made him a valentine got free tickets to the remainder of the season. I learned that some athletes do have a soft-side and sports aren't the only thing their life revolves around. I'd recommend this book to anyone who shares a true passion for athletics. 
 This cd is for my mother her birthday, but I want to know which titles the singers have. Because I only know the Title "Kisses sweeter than wine" Than I here the cd.  He was a very good singer!   
  This book is an excellent study of Palestinian art and its history. Art work of Ismail Shammout, Sliman Mansour, Kamal Boullata are extensively described with the relevant context to the times and loss of Palestine inhabitants.  One comes across not only paintings but also other forms of expression - 'mud on wood'(page 84).   One of the paintings 'Whereto?' on page 49 shows the effect of influence of 'absence of a character (part of defined standard of family)' by exclusion from the figure-ground of a painting but not from a higher space of our  understanding. While paintings are assumed to be more real by blending into the atmosphere i.e extending onto the walls that they are placed. This one creates a great seperation. It is to such art that you get introduced to in this book. Mona Hatoum's work is described , most of which is daily home objects turned useless in a very prickly way, the source of it being her sense of alienation from home. The same themes are explored in works of Khalil Rabah and Asad Azi.  
 I was glad I had this book along with me when I went to see the real Book of Kells at the Trinity College Library in Dublin.  The lines of tourists waiting to view this famous eighth century manuscript were about a quarter of a mile long, and the museum proctors were really hustling us through the area where a small sampling of pages were actually on view.  (If you take the tour, be sure to check out the main chamber of the Old Library with its first editions of Newton and Darwin, plus the harp that is (alas, falsely) attributed to Brian Boru, high king of Ireland).  The first facsimile of the Book of Kells was published in 1974, and although this book only advertises itself as 'an illustrated introduction to the manuscript...' it contains good color plates of many of the most famous pages, e.g. the symbols of the four evangelists and the beginning of the 'Breves causae' of Matthew, among others.  Author, Bernard Meehan, the current Keeper of Manuscripts at Trinity College states that "the sacred text itself was copied in the Book of Kells with a remarkable degree of inaccuracy."  It consists of the Latin text of the Gospels, illuminated in the very ornate Hiberno-Saxon style ('Hiberno' refers to the Irish, or Hibernians).  Legend has it that the Book of Kells was produced by St. Colum Cille on the island of Iona off western Scotland.  Although it was probably begun in the Irish monastery on Iona, it was taken to the monastery of Kells in County Meath, after a series of Viking raids.   The monastery on Iona was pillaged in 795, and again in 802.  According to the author, "In 806, sixty-eight of the community were killed in another raid.  The following year, the survivors migrated to Ireland and began to erect conventual buildings at Kells..." where the illumination of the manuscript was probably completed.  If you are interested in the historical background of the Book of Kells, the author devotes a whole Appendix to it.  Alas, according to this book's second Appendix, "Losses, Additions and Marginalia," the Book of Kells has not remained intact down through the centuries.  "At present there are 340 folios, but around thirty folios, including some major decorated pages have been lost."  The monks also used blank spaces in the manuscript to record details of property transactions in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries.  Meehan's book is definitely worth viewing and reading.  It also  contains a wealth of the smaller decorative illustrations that do not always relate to the sacred text, e.g. hares, dogs, horses, and at least one moth.  The color and minute details of these decorations are a source of endless fascination, and the scholarly text, although a trifle dry, is also very interesting. 
 I admit to some trepidation in picking up a book that is marketed as a love story.  But I have to confess, that after I'd read 30 pages of Claire Marvel, I could not stop reading it. Despite having to juggle family and other obligations, I finished it in one weekend, although I savored the images and feelings for weeks afterwards.  I was even tempted to read it again, immediately, something I never do.  In short, I was obsessed with Claire Marvel.  And I'm not the only one.  My husband and most of my friends who have read it have become obsessed by Claire as well.  This book really makes the reader feel love--in all of its glory, ambiguity and agony--in a way that no other book I have read before does.  Put this book at the top of your list, but be warned that it may become an obsession 
 I think this book is really a good book for students, and for people who want to refresh their understandings about diffusion. I am now interested in diffusion in polymer/solvents solution during coated film is being dried. The drying mechanism is complicated as this is a moving boundary problem, accompanying multi-component diffusion in the coated layer and solvents evaporation from the surface. This book contains little topics relating to the above, but still I felt the necessity of returning to fundamentals, and read this book. The writing style of this book is very frank, viz. the author expresses his value judgments and opinions based on his experiences. If I were young, I would like to take his lessons using this book. I couldn't understand why ratings hear are so much spreading. 
 I struggled a little with the first part of this book, finding it a bit slow and technical. However the action really hots up when 'we' reach the Dordogne region of France in the mid 1300's. It was exciting with engaging characters and plenty of twists and turns, keeping me glued to the story until the final page.  Well worth a read. 
 Lemme tell you something. If a Christian gets to only have one live Christian music experience in his/her life, this needs to be it!!! I'm dancing in my seat right now as I listen, type this, and pray for the Christians that gave it 2 stars!!  This group is DYNAMIC. Approach this CD like you would a spiritual feast you never tried before because that's the only way I can explain Tye and G.A.. I have been saved for about 22 years (I'm 27) and have NEVER seen/heard of a group to even compare their style to. I agree with the previous reviewer who talked about how David danced like a wild man. That is how this concert was live!!! They make you want to scream, run, shout and whatever else you do when filled with the joy of the Lord.   I had never heard of Tye Tribbett before last week and then he came to Phoenix, Arizona. I went with some friends and as soon as they came out on stage I didn't know what had hit me. Their energy and the level of anointing on them is second to none. They are such a blessing, and it's the kinda music that you can't possibly sit down to. I pray for them and their ministry that they reach young people everywhere. This is the type of music ministry that changes lives. Every Christian unfortunately isn't ready for this type of experience. YOU GOTTA BE READY!!  If you give this 2 stars, wow. Get the DVD or see these songs performed live so you can get a better understanding of the anointing on it and come back. Tye will be filling stadiums in no time. BLESS-ED, BE THE NAME OF THE LORD! 
 The previous review writer seems to have misunderstood the review  presented above.  The review, in fact, DOES allude to Jouanna's text.  The  Loeb version is merely discussed in Jouanna's text in the "Notes"  section 
     It is easy to follow, clear cut and useful. The reader should have a working knowledge of access. I found the work on queries best followed by reports then forms. It could use better proof reading but that's a minor thing compared to the books content. I definitely got the books price in useful information 
 If it comes from "Foreign Affairs" you know the writing is informed, intelligenct, and thought provoking.  Save your money if you subscribe to "Foreign Affairs," though, since these essays are in the current and previous issue.  This is a useful book for the student, instructor, or someone with a general interest in the topic 
 now my kids love this movie to like I did when I was there age 
 This is like 90 minutes of performance art. I suppose with a one page script this was never going to win any awards for best screenplay. It's a bit like a long hallucinogenic bad trip. Fando keeps running into insane encounters and when he isn't he is acting cruelly towards Lis, with shades of Dennis Hopper's character in Blue Velvet. There are plenty of memorable scenes as the couple journey towards Tar, whatever/wherever that is. It reminded me a bit of that bizarre road movie Supervixens, so if you're a Russ Meyer fan you may like this. Finally, you can get the Holy Mountain+El Topo box set from xploitedcinema.com (avoid the Japanese versions - nudity is obscured) 
 This work is a solid foundation for devotion - good faith, good works, and humility.  The teachings of Kempis place an emphasis on leaving the ego behind to serve others with purity of heart and mind.  This book, made for catholics, also found its place on the shelves and in the hearts of protestants aswell...namely for its copious biblical literalism.  The beauty of this book lies in its appeal to all who wish to follow Christ...its amiable in its nature and works wherever you wish to serve Him.  Just pick up a copy and see why this book is only second to the Bible in copies printed 
 For the price - this is a great buy! Colors are good - has a nice weight to it! Would buy more from this merchant 
 This was by far the scariest book I have EVER read.  I had to put it down quite a few times because I was sure that there were vampires behind me.  Good character development (which is important to me)and full of surprises.  If you get scared easily, this might not be the book for you 
 I lived in Japan off and on over the course of 15 years, and I formally studied Japanese (in college or at a private language academy) for a little over two years.  Even so, my Japanese was a combination of  "perfect" and "invented".  This book proved to be an  excellent refresher course for me, and my Japanese improved remarkably.  I  have no problems with kana, but my kanji knowledge was limited to only  about 600 -- I was reminded of a number of kanji I should have known, and  learned quite a few more that I hadn't known before.  Japanese for Busy  People III offers a wonderful blend of review and new material, with plenty  of reading, vocabulary work, practice of both writing kanji and grammar  work/substitution drills.  Explanations of grammar are written in English  and romaji, but the majority of the text is kana and kanji, with furigana  where appropriate.  I highly recommend this book, (and books I and II for  those in the earlier levels of Japanese study) for self-study 
 I really liked the descriptive language and imagery in this book. The plot wasn't amazing, but it took me into a world I don't usually visit, and I enjoyed being there, even when it was uncomfortable. The characters felt real and I give credit to Jennifer Belle for depicting a different side to life as a college student 
 I am very much a believer in the power and beauty of the female form, which this book portrays flawlessly. The poses these women can get into are amazing, and you can see their joy and energy in every image. Yes, the figures are nude, but even if you're squirrely about nudity, the photographs are so beautiful and the representations so tastefully done that you'd almost have to be crazy to be offended by them. Besides, yoga pants and track suits don't exactly portray the awesome beauty of the female body.:) Definitely check this book out 
 I loved this book!  I found it totally engaging, original, clever, well researched and seductive.  Ms Elyot has a wonderful imagination that takes her heroine (and her audience) through an entertaining array of adventures.  Ms Elyot's detailed descriptions successfully transport her readers from contemporary New York to Bath 1801 via time travel.  Particularly well handled are the intimate scenes between our heroine and her love.   I am eagerly awaiting Ms. Elyot's next book 
 It is amazeing to hear the comments and various reviews of Buffalo Springfield's first record. The record shows an abilty by the groups collective membership to create a totally new sound for the times,circa mid 1960's. The emergence of Folk Rock in the form of introspective songwriteing,intricate guitar interplay, and mystical harmonies. This their first record, demonstrates the wonderful collective contributions made by it's members. This band was working great together to blend it's different personalities, songwriteing talents,guitar styles and voices, into a new and sprited sound. Ever try to get three gutar players together and not get in each others way ? Hard to do,yet Buffalo Springfileld does it with an amazeing dexterity.    The forces in this band are powerful, unfortunately the   producers of this album were not sufficient to the task. Even with the poor production. still, the sounds of the bands elements are truely creative.   Richie Furay, was the front man and seems to be the glue that holds much of it together on this record. Steve Stills, an amazeing guitar player with a truely soulful voice, writes  what was  the  big hit, For What it's worth, proveing that he is a force to be reckoned with. He and Ritchie work so well together on this record. Then there is Neil Young, his voice, his song writeing, his frantic guitar solos, truely  amazeing.   I always love the first attempt of any bands recordings, you can see where the roots are. Buffalo Springfield really has a great collective gell,I would have loved to have heard the Band play live in the beginning. By the time Buffalo Springfiled Again was recorded,the Band had expanded in Fantastic ways, but this record,their first,if you listen closely,will show you why the Band and its memebers became legendary.   
 This is great for daytime use. This clean, clear, lightly floral perfume always bring me good moods in busy days. A black wood seat came with this perfume and it enhanced the simple water drop bottle design. This price is also a great bargain! 
 My 9 year-old son had to do a book report on a historical fiction book about Rome.  We read this together, as it was a little above his reading level in places.  My 7 year-old listened as well.  We read it in 3 days, if they had had their way, we would have finished in one.  They loved this story.  I stopped in several places and we recounted the logic of characters, trying to figure out the mystery ourselves.  I also had a map of ancient Rome handy, to follow the various wanderings of the characters.  Knowing your Greek/Roman myths is a plus, this book is a great application for those just finishing studying the ancient myths.  For those concerned about violence and character issues, there are many situations that present themselves in the story for discussion.  We had a few times where we stopped and asked, "What do you think about that decision?"  A great book, WE highly recommend it 
 Personally, I found this book to be very interestring.  The proofs and ideas are presented in clear and non-rigomorphic fashion.  One is able to read the works of Nash in the way he himself presented them, and hopefully appropriate some mental strategies used by this genius.  There is much that goes on behind the scene of creation of proofs.  I think mathematicians of today would greatly benefit from availability of larger number of books which would contain the mathematical works in the way they were originally presented.  This is certainly a major step in that direction 
 This book is an excellent reminder of things we should have learned by our fifties and sixties.  In addition, the author shares his own experience of grief and grieving in a very helpful way. Whether it is a loss of a job, a divorce, or death, we all need to cope with grief and loss.  This book offers a practical but sympathetic understanding and a reminder of the important things of life.  
 This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Exciting story with attractive stars and very sensual.  I recommend this movie very strongly 
 Barstow's history examines feminist concerns relating to the witch hunts without succumbing to a prejudicial bias. Though her focus is the persecution of women as witches, the text realistically examines the sources of the problem without devolving into a feminist tirade or resorting to man- or church-bashing.   The text addresses a variety of issues significant to the study of the fairy tales, particularly in defining the methods of characterization that were used to identify and to stereotype women as witches. The same characteristics, both real and projected, that were used to identify  and persecute witches during the European witch hunts can be clearly seen in the characterization of witches in fairy tales. Barstow identifies "the witch" as a hostile stereotype by which "Women who challenge patriarchal structures... will be made to pay." This is as true in fairy tales as it was during the witch hunts. Barstow's text is indispensable to understanding how the witch character developed as well as examining the purpose of gender roles in fairy tales 
 I have always had a fascination with astronomy. After reading this book, that fascination turned almost into an obsession with Mars. Zubrin lays out a plan that seems perfect to land the first man on Mars. This book is an interesting read, even for the non-scientist types, as Zubrin finds a healthy balance. Very interesting book and  very intellect man. Not to be missed by anyone interested in space 
 This is one movie where it seems a lot of people either like it or really hate it. What I find about this film, though, is that the people who hate it do so for the wrong reasons (or at least they can't articulate why, but I have a theory). Here are some of the complaints:  *"It is boring" - Since when did loud, fast and outrageous become associated with boring? I don't care how slow something is. If it is different, innovative, and interesting, it is not boring. Your standard Michael Bay film is boring - this film is not.  *"The background of the characters was not fleshed out." We hear Eagan's life story, get to meet his seven sisters, hear all his hopes and fears as admitted to his brother-in-law, and go through every neurotic detail of his life. The only way to this character could possibly be fleshed out more is if we saw him going to the bathroom.  *"Bad acting." What these people are really saying is that they miss the low-brow roles traditionally played by Sandler (not that those roles aren't funny). Critics gave good reviews to Sandler's depth and Watson's portrayal. Sorry, but I put more faith in Ebert's evaluation of good acting than I do your typical fan of 50-cent movies or "Dukes of Hazzard."  *"The plot is rather predictable" - I defy anyone to predict what would have happened two scenes after watching a scene. "Armageddon" and "Independence Day" are predictable - this film is not.  If you like formula, then avoid this movie. If you want to see something interesting, innovative, and sometimes funny, this movie is for you 
 Sickened is a touching memoir that tells the story of a girl's (Julie's) childhood...or lack there of.  Her childhood was plagued by Munchausen's by proxy syndrome; a form of child abuse where a caretaker deliberately induces illness on a child by poisoning them or by other measures, or simply makes up symptoms of a child in order to satisfy their own need for attention and acknowledgement.  Julie's mother used a combination of inducing symptoms on Julie by giving her an array of pills, starving her, overworking her, and lying to doctors about false symptoms.  Her whole childhood was spent going from doctor to doctor trying to find one that would listen to her mother because "her child was sick" and "the other doctors were just not smart enough and did not care enough to finally find some answers."  Julie does not know how her mother is hurting her until one day she is in her college psychology class and the professor starts talking about Munchausen's by proxy syndrome.  As soon as Julie hears the professor, she snaps out of her daze...she can relate to everything he is saying!  It was a huge slap in the face for her to suddenly learn that she is not the sickly girl her mother has made her out to be, but that the mother she has listened to and trusted all her life has actually been hurting her.  Her mother had her brainwashed as a girl...Julie was always told she was just an ugly, sickly girl, so that is how Julie always perceived herself.  Once she learned that it was her mother that had the problem, and not her, she was able to move past this image and see herself as much more than the sad, sickly girl.   	This book takes a reader on an emotional roller coaster.  I found myself wanting to reach out and help Julie, to tell her what her mother was doing to her.  The book made a lasting impact on me by telling personal accounts of Julie on her different trips to hospitals; from her unneeded surgery to her mother begging the doctor to perform open heart surgery.  The book let a reader get inside Julie's head at all these times to find out what she was thinking, how scared and confused she was.  It pained me to read about her going through all the unnecessary pain.  Julie's stories make a very informative, non-fiction book attention-grabbing by evoking emotion in the reader. 
 On hearing Matthew would be playing in Toronto, I ran out and bought a copy of "Living Things".  I was disappointed to the point where I thought I would skip his live show.  Luckily my wife insisted we go.  Matthew looked a mess.  The band was 3 guitars, a bass, and drum.  The volume and the feedback were way up and they burnt through blistering renditions of almost all of "Living Things" plus his other big hits.  From that moment on I have loved "Living Things".  So if you find "Living Things" disappointing you need to just catch Matthew playing it live.  It will rock for you after that 
 As an avid reader of the series I have been waiting impatiently for this book for a long time...I am glad to say that it did not disappoint in any way. It is highly recommended...just make sure that you have a good two weeks to devote to it 
 To the other reviews here, I'd like to mention Corvo's disconnection from the real world. He seems to believe that kings and popes still really ran the world like they did in 1300. His Hadrian VII persuades Europe to be carved into an Empire of the North, ruled by the King of Prussia, an Empire of the South, by the King of Italy. The American Republic, is given all of South America; the Japanese Empire, gets Siberia; and the rest of the world goes to the King of England. Uh, yeah 
 Great beats, nice vocals & a beautiful voice.  This CD is an easy recommendation.  The first track almost reminds me of Sade.  Also, check out CD's by Esthero, Baxter, CeBille & Si Se 
 This product is a God send for those people who have a dog that pulls on the leash and thereby making walking the dog a struggle!  Dogs naturally will tug against restraint.  Former methods of using a choke collar or even worse a harsh coller that will cut into the dogs neck if it pulls are cruel in my opinion as is the method of jerking the dog back if it pulls.  Dogs do not like to have thier heads turned if they pull.  They will IMMEDIATELY stop pulling!  I admit that initially my dogs didn't like the collar over the nose, but that passes quickly.  This is not a muzzle in any way.  It gently and humanely stops the tugging and you will have happy walks!  This product is a blessing!  You will love it 
 Boogie Nights let us know that we really loved the 70's and that we really ARE nostalgic for the music from the period - ALL THE MUSIC!  This second CD from the film soundtrack effectively provides us with more memories from not only the film, but from the era.  Apollo 100's Joy is a favorite as is Three Dog Night's Mama Told Me Not to Come.  Thought neither CD (CD 1 nor this one) contains Andrew Gold's Lonely Boy, which I really felt was emotionally a direct hit - so that's a bad thing.  Both of these CDs will share a welcome place in your house along with the DVD of the film 
 I purchased this movie thinking I really wasn't going to enjoy.  Boy, was I wrong!  Cybill did an outstanding job portraying Martha Stewart.  The actors and actresses brought the characters to life in this movie.  Though the movie may not be 100% factual, it's a must to add to your collection.  You will see a woman working hard at any cost to get where she wants to be in life, but also realizing MONEY isn't everything 
 Biographies by old warriors and old jocks usually are just not that good.  This one is different.  I have followed Mr. Palmer's career from the start, and after reading this work, felt I knew him much better.  It was pure Palmer.  The book is well written, informative and actually rather inspiring. As I suspected, I could not find one line in the book to lead me to a different opinion, one I have held for years, that this is a true gentleman.  Wish there were more like him in the world of sports today.  On the other hand, as hinted at above, Mr. Palmer has been one of my "heros" since I was eight years old or so, so, in my eyes, he could do little wrong, including writing his autobiography.  Recommend the read for anyone 
 I love this cookbook!  I like its conservative approach with money and fat and sugar, and I like the broad range of recipes and the recipes themselves.  I'm a vegetarian, but although this cookbook has meat recipes in it, too, I don't feel excluded 
 My wife had been fed up with all of the legal dramas I was maknig her watch.  Being a third year law student she always netpicks the details.  But the story in this fil overrides the legal fallacies, making True Believer a great drama that centers around a lawsuit 
 I had this album when it came out I was a junior in high school and this album literally sounds better than 90 percent of the music out now. Krs-0ne and x-clan had sort of an intellectual beef when this album dropped they went back and forth on some philosophy type rebuttal records (SEE "Sex and violence" by KRS) that was crazy. Anyway album is a great buy if you want to know where hip hop was 15 years ago. Buy the way this has been protected.....you know the rest. PEAC 
 This is a first hand account of two thwarted attempts to round Cape Horn from the west. It is written by Miles Smeeton, the skipper of the forty two foot ketch, Tzu Hang. It is not for sailors only, and if all you want is sailing, you may end up bored. Much of the book takes place in a port town in Chile, where the Smeetons and John Guzzwell (Trekka Round the World) put in for repairs. The Chilean section is interesting in that it is about the people who end up involved in helping to restore the yacht - some of whom are real characters.  Be sure to read the forward, which provides a brief expalnation of who these people were, and how they ended up spending their retirement sailing the worlds oceans.  Smeeton is not a professional writer, but he writes well, with good descriptions of the people they met, his own impressions, and sensory detail, all of which combine to make the book readable.  There is an historical angle as well. It takes place in the mid-1950's. Smeeton and his wife, Beryl, retired after World War II, Smeeton being an Btritish Army officer and veteran of that war. They are virtually never freaked-out, and always find time for tea.  If you like Brits, if you like sailing, or if you just like a first hand account of some of the original adventure travelers, you will like this book 
 I could hardly wait to get my hands on this book once it came out in paperback! The sequele to Light in Shadow, Truth or Dare rapped up all the lose relationship strings. Arcadia's 'deciesed' husband showed up and her relationship with Harry finally cemented. Bonnie and Singleton movied further along in there progressing relationship and Eathan and Zoe finally solidified there marrige.  Jayne Krentz's book provids twists and turns that just when you think you have the protaganist nerrowed down she unfold some new clue that makes you second guess yourself.  Enjoy 
 My mom reminds me that my brother and I would request this book most often out of all of Dr. Seuss's when bedtime rolled around.  It may have been because we loved our bedtime stories and didn't want them to end.  This is the longest and most expansive of Dr. Seuss's books.  Reading it again at twenty-eight, I still don't want it to end.  It is a deliciously meandering story, guaranteed to have grown-ups and kids alike snuggled up tight, and saying good-night 
 The S.F. Bay area's Anne Lamott is well known through her fiction (Joe Jones, Crooked Little Heart, All New People, etc.) and non-fiction (Bird by Bird, Traveling Mercies, Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith).   Both adored and distrusted for her outspoken faith and her hilarious candor about messy issues like sexual mores, abortion, divorce, Lamott's writings demonstrate that life is a bundle of contradictions for people like her, like me, like all of us who on the way but not there yet. A Guggenheim fellowship recipient, she has been a Mademoiselle book reviewer and a California restaurant critic. She has taught at UC Davis and teaches writing workshops across the U.S.     In Blue Shoe, Lamott allows us to eavesdrop and peek in on the tensions, struggles, and alliances made and broken by three generations of Mattie Ryder's family. She is a forty-something, perfect size 12, divorced mother of two young children, struggling to support her household, and to find her way forward amidst life's discouragements. Her narcissistic liberal activist mother. Isa, looms over the narrative as does the shadow of her dead father, Alfred.  Mattie's is very much a stereotypical Marin County family, hedonistic, liberal, educated, free-living.  The blue shoe named in the title is a vending machine trinket Mattie treats like a good luck charm.  Tracing its origins connects Mattie and her brother Al to family secrets that will wound before they heal.   Despite Mattie's (and Lamott's) transparent Christian faith, there are no plaster saints in this book, but only gritty, real people.  Lamott is a disciplined author, and knows it is best to show rather than tell.   Like a sea shell left on the shore by a receding wave, the theme of this book emerges from the experience of its characters rather than being placarded and proclaimed. The theme is stated but not trumpeted as such in Chapter Ten, where Mattie tells her brother, "Yesterday I had an epiphany.  I realized that all I have to do is to tell the truth, and let go of the results" (223).   Her theme could be expressed in this wry version of a familiar New Testament text:  "The truth will set you free, but first it will make you miserable."   This is my first Lamott novel, so I can't compare it to others she has written.  She succeeds here in opening her theme to us like leaves of an avocado, inviting us to savor the subtle flavors and fragrances arising from her narrative.  The pace is slow-moving, and this too is a credit to Lamott's artistry, because real life is not a quickly dispatched explanation, but a slow process of experience and discovery sorted out from the tangle of the mundane.   Despite her slow pace, too slow for some, I give Blue Shoe five stars because I believe this slowness is appropriate to a portrayal of life as it is, where the fragments of lessons learned assemble slowly before taking discernible shape.   I recommend Blue Shoe to anyone prepared to see life and relationships in full color rather than in black and white.  Lamott calls us to openness to new information, and to willingness to seek out and face unexpected or uncomfortable truths.  The rich web of relationships clustered around Mattie Ryder is transformed as a result.  If our experience would reflect theirs, we will need courage, curiosity, and perhaps a lucky blue shoe of our own. 
 Hutch aka Cold187um from Above the Law returns with a solo album. Like most ATL albums, this one is a gem that will most likely be slept on by all heads. Hutch's production seems to get better and better on each project  and from the few tracks that I have heard there's no exception on this  project. You have got to support real music like this 
 Over the Memorial Day weekend, I had the good fortune to be invited to Maine to see the fabulous tree house that is the subject of The Treehouse Chronicles.  I decided this would be a good chance to listen to a recording of an old favorite that I've never heard in audio form before.  Browsing through the library, it was an easy decision to pick this new recording of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Within minutes, I could tell that I'd made a winning choice as I listened to Stephen Fry brilliantly share his voice to add texture to this intriguing story.  Between the accents and the humorous references to irony, I was enthralled.  I found myself wishing that the recording was a longer one.  When you read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it can come across a little simplistically in places.  Those spots work much smoother in this audio version.    In fact, if you haven't read the book, I recommend that you listen to this recording instead.  I think you'll enjoy and appreciate the book more in its more dramatic version here.  If you don't know the story, Arthur Dent finds himself awakening with a hangover determined to save his home.  Only problem is, while the demolition crew looms, he's also about to lose his other home, the Earth.  Aided by his alien friend, Ford Prefect, Arthur is soon off hitchhiking his way through the galaxy in a most improbable set of circumstances that will amuse and delight you.  You'll meet Zaphod Beeblebrox, one of the most memorable aliens in anyone's fiction.  Along the way, you'll learn more speculation about wearing digital watches and finding lost ballpoint pens than you ever expected to know.  Bravo, Stephen Fry and Douglas Adams 
 I've recently been using a progesterone cream and it changed my life! I had been using estrogen therapies for 2 years and couldn't get my body adjusted. It wasn't until I started with the cream and then read this book  that I realized it wasn't just me, it's all of us out there, struggling  with this issue. It's the doctors who don't or won't look at this  alternative to synthetic hormones who really need to read this book 
 This book is great!  Sharon is a loving mother and wife and she approaches all things in her life with passion.  A wonderful book 
 A previous reviewer, who very much disliked the book, wrote, "...nothing heroin can give or represent can be worth what the junky lifestyle takes out of a person and makes the user become." Well, that's the point of the book. Were you expecting a romantic view of heroin? From William S. Burroughs? You don't know the man. Heroin is NOT romantic, despite what the current pop social climate might intimate. If you were turned off by what the book depicts, William S. Burroughs has done his job. Bravo! Burroughs saves another soul (and somewhere else, someone reading another of his books is busy being lost...). The Great Equalizer. Rise above.. 
 A very good introduction that gives an over view of the used and rare book marke 
 I agree with the above review and would simply like to add my own thoughts.  The book illustrates the fascinating way in which mathematics, society, religion, politics and of course physics have affected each other  (it goes both ways!) through out the ages.  Furthermore, the author nicely  illustrates the processes by which people think and how those processes  have also changed through the ages (i.e., The Age of Reason versus The  Renisance).  This book left me with real insights as to the nature and  limitations of the current state of mathematics and physics.  Things are  not as they seem, my friend!  Lastly, the author displays an appreciation  for the humor and irony of the history which makes this book hard to put  down at times.  I never thought a math/history book could be a "page  turner"... Read it 
 I'd like to echo the other reviews -- this toy (and the yellow matching fighter, natch) are really excellent. At the age of 37, I was so smitten with this toy that I bought it and the other one, to, er, play with with my son, yeah. The only problems are, the fake R2 unit (although I plan to see which of my R2 figures will fit, based on comments others have made), and the stickers are rather hard to put on. In general, this toy is indicative of the extra effort Hasbro has made with ep III, compared to, say, the CRAP they made for ep 2, that disappointed me so much I stopped buying figures for a while. 
 DVD is in perfect condition. Will by from this buyer again 
 In THE MILL ON THE FLOSS, George Eliot writes of her heroine Maggie Tulliver in such a way that autobiography seems inevitable.   Even had Eliot not made a secret of the nearly one to one relationship between her and Maggie, the connection is too obvious to ignore.  In George Eliot's personal life, she had an ongoing dispute with her brother that so distressed her that the only way to resolve it was in her fiction.  So Maggie spends nearly the entire novel trying to prove her unselfish love to her brother Tom who refuses to see the good in Maggie until the highly controversial ending in which Maggie nobly risks her life to convince Tom that her love for him is unsullied.  However much one sees of Eliot in Maggie, Maggie is still a fully-rounded individual whom Eliot has chosen to flesh out in a manner that was unheard of for her time.  In presenting the character of Maggie, as well as the others, Eliot presents the unfolding of their distinct personalities against the backdrop of their respective social milieus.  Eliot suggests that society has a definite impact on the way each character develops. For Eliot, character is formed partly by his or her environment and exhibited heavily in the ways that she chooses to allow each character to act in their homes, their fields, and their workplaces.    Eliot traces a gradual connection between theme and character.  Since environment is one of the two primary factors that impact on the push-pull connection between theme and character, she is careful to delineate early on that the same environment that houses Maggie and Tom nevertheless pushes each to a sociological fork in the road from which each takes a divergent turn. This divergence leads to the book's primary theme: the evolving nature between brother and sister is both cause and effect of the ultimate maritime tragedy that concludes the book.  Maggie, even as a young child, is seen as perpetually in conflict, the causes of which are beyond her control.  Maggie has an internal conflict in that she is often called to make a choice between that which her heart calls for (say, her love for Stephen Guest) and that which her duty forbids (the vast class gap between the two that forbids a relation). Maggie also has a direct conflict with Tom, whose brutishness and inexplicable meanness toward her impel both toward the book's tragic close.  Finally, she has an ongoing conflict with society at large, symbolized by a collective mass of family, friends, lovers, and a cobwebbery of implicit rules that Maggie breaks unwittingly and to tragic effect.  The ending of THE MILL OF THE FLOSS has created a controversy that has lingered from Eliot's day to ours. When Maggie chooses to literally die with Tom than to live without him, the reader is faced with passing judgment on its credibility.  Has Eliot taken the cheap way out and sought the conventionally tragic ending of the sentimental Victorian novel?  Or is Maggie's final act of unselfishness to be viewed through the lens of autobiography in which the author is vicariously healing the rift between her and her real life brother with the sacrifice of Maggie for her fictional one?  The question was raised then and is often raised now with no resolution. What remains is a novel whose ongoing charm lies in its depiction of a style of life that was seen as far removed even in Eliot's day and for which retains a nostalgic charm that the passing of the centuries cannot lessen. 
 I suspect that Professor Jay Hosler is the wacky science teacher that I've always wanted to be like and I have empirical evidence in the form of his delightful graphic novel The Sandwalk Adventures. In the book, Charles Darwin must convince follicle mites living in his left eyebrow that he is not their creator and that evolution happens.  Even though that sounds psycho, Hosler manages to explain the basics of Charles Darwin, evolution, and get in some comments about the dangers of blind faith in an entertaining way.  Hosler's drawing style is simple, well done, and was most likely strongly influenced by Herge's Tintin.  Even though I'm a geoperson and a high school earth science teacher, The Sandwalk Adventures makes me want to take a couple of Professor Hosler's biology classes 
 i really like carole matthews's books, but a little dissapointed when i ended this book it didnt have the same "this was a great book" feeling. 
 This is one of the most attractive dog-book I've ever read. You will get more understanding about the world of your beloved dog, that actually, we can humanize dog. The scope of this book is about dog's life, dog's manner,  dog's soul, and....I can't mention all of them. Buy this book, and you will  understand by yourself  
 My daughter loves this toy. She got it for Christmas. I didn't have batteries for it for a few days, but she played with it even without the sounds & lights. She loves the phone that hangs from it. I finally got batteries for it, and it kept her entertained quite a bit on our 11 hour trip to the beach. The remote came in handy. I'd just hit a button, & it would light up & play music for her while she was in her car seat. Highly recommend! 
 this series is becomming my next favorite to the lord of the rings.  thank you terry goodkind 
 Who would've thought that mastrubation, oral sex, rape, S & M and homosexuality have reproductive advantages?  Or that every human sexual behavior and perversion has an equivalent in birds or monkeys?  Having some basic knoledge of evolution and how it works, I always thought that things like masturbation and oral sex were just by products of the sexual desire used for reproduction, but apparently not.    My favorite quote of the book   "There are reports, for example, of a male masturbating to ejaculation while being penetrated anally by another male."  Enjo 
 If you are at all interested in  this man, this is the book to read.  My interest started with Orson Wells and led me to "W.R."  Mr. Nasaw has pin-pointed the essence of this man and what made him tick, without all the rhetoric of Thomas Ince or the battle over "Citizen Kane."  Don't miss the chance to know William Randolph Hearst.  A great read 
 I really enjoyed this book it kept me entertained and it was an easy read.  Romance and Mystery all wrapped up in one, Just when you think you know whats going to happen next.  Nora Roberts changes things on you and don't think you know the ending because I was shocked to find out the truth 
 I own several low carb cookbooks and this one has many great recipes and is not written in the usual stuffy medical jargon that is common place today.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in the low carb lifestyle...it has a substitution chart and a glossary of unusual items...any low carber knows there are a lot of "unusual items" on our grocery lists, and it's nice to know what they are 
 I just finished reading Mrs. Dalloway for the second time.  The first time I read it years ago (as so many seem to have done) when The Hours came out.  At that time, I found it interesting, though not easy-going reading.  Now I read it for a class and enjoyed it even more having learned a bit more about Woolf and her life and her theories of literature.  Mrs. Dalloway is Woolf's attempt to get beneath the surfaces of human beings, to show all the emotions and thoughts that go one in peoples' minds even on the most ordinary of days and while they are involved in the most mundane of tasks.  Each life becomes a complex, beautiful thing when examined in this life.  Woolf also said she was trying to show the sane and the insane side by side in this novel which, comparing the characters of Mrs. Dalloway and the shell-shocked Septimus Smith--the two have much in common despite the great differences in their lives and ways.  The book is worth reading for the insight Woolf provides into the human condition and for the poetry of language with which she expresses it.  Having read Jacob's Room just prior to this book (and which she wrote just prior to this one) it's possible to see how Woolf progressed as a writer and as a stylist.  Next on the list is "To the Lighthouse," which, I'm told, shows Woolf even more at the top of her form. Can't wait 
    I am a teacher and bought this book at my school's book fair.  I actually really liked the cover.  That is what caught my eye.  Anyway, this was a pretty good book.  Fairly dark and gloomy--not an uplifting book by any means.  But, the writing flowed and I found myself reading on.  My daughter is into fantasy books, so I believe this book would appeal to kids who like that type of writing.  There are worse books out there that try to appeal to kids.  
 I actually had to send this back, however.  While it had great features and a great price, it was a little too small for me (in 2 ways).  I think the volume was a little small for the week of backpacking I was planning.  But more specifically, it only came in one size, and I couldn't adjust it adequately for my height (6'2").  I was sad to send it back, however, because it seemed very nice otherwise 
 this was by far one of the greatest gifts ever received and greatly enjoye 
 If cows are your particular passion, then A Cow's Life will grab you with Montana native M.R. Montgomery's observations of cows gained from his own daily experience with cattle. Much more than just an observational piece, A Cow's Life provides a history of cattle, the black angus in particular, and explores the controversies and issues involved in cattle farm management. An affectionate look at the cow. 
 Can any one help me locate a Testing or Assessment instrument that I can use to validate the usefulness of Ice-breakers or Group Warm-up Exercises? I am a Ph.D. student at Walden Un. presenting a research paper on the  usefulness of Ice-breakers through Experiential Learning. I would be most  greatful for any help I can get. Derrick W. Coppe 
 This book was so well written, so full of suspense, and so interesting. I loved it!! It wasn't a book that was all about the murders and finding the killers, it was about these characters that were just so real, it put you right there. I would recommend this book to anyone. Fantastic 
 If you are a potential reader of the book, I would recommend that you skip the analysis and comment - and I will not discuss the plot here. Instead, just jump in and read the novel. You can read the analysis later. I read this Oxford version of the novel a few months ago after being directed towards it by such well known writers as Saul Bellow and Vladimir Nabokov. They have written pieces and done interviews where they have pointed to this work of Flaubert as a pivotal work in the development of the modern novel and realism. It was followed by other great novels from writers such as Tolstoy, D.H. Lawrence, Dreiser, and Joyce, etc. It is a great novel, certainly yes, but in addition it is simply a great read.  With all of that fanfare, how does one write a review for Amazon? My quick answer is that the book meets all expectations. It immediately captures the reader. I read it start to finish in one day. It was impossible to put down. After reading  it I read Flaubert's "Sentimental Education." It is a somewhat slower paced novel and it is good as well, but not quite as good as "Madame Bovary."  There are a number of charming features found in the novel. These include the interesting characters and the 19th century rural French atmosphere. With this setting and with the interesting characters, Flaubert strives for just the right phrases, the correct plot, and the proper structure to present his tale. It is said that he wrote only 100 pages per year and agonized over every paragraph. It seems as such, because the final product is a smooth quick read.  The prose is beautifully written and has its own charm. Here is an example for about one quarter of the way into the book shortly after from when the protagonist Emma meets her first lover.  "It was early in October. There was fog over the land. Hazy clouds hovered on the horizon between the outlines of the hills; others, rent asunder, floated up and disappeared. Sometimes through a rift in the clouds, beneath a ray of sunshine, gleamed from afar the roots of Yonville, with the gardens at the water's edge, the yards, the walls and the church steeple. Emma half closed her eyes to pick out her house, and never had this poor village where she lived appeared so small. From the height on which they were the whole valley seemed an immense pale lake sending off its vapour into the air. Clumps of trees here and there stood out like black rocks, and the tall lines of the poplars that rose above the mist were like a beach stirred by the wind."  So, do not think about this novel too much and do not read too much analysis, just read it an enjoy it. For a follow up analysis, see Nabokov's "Lectures on Literature" from his days at Cornell. He dedicates a chapter to "Madame Bovary" and he places it among the great European novels 
 Coleman Silk was the most highly-regarded professor at Athena College until a slip of the tongue in the classroom one day resulted in the entire community deeming him as a racist. Coleman ended up resigning from the college as a result of the scandal, and he's still very bitter about it two years after the fact. The year is 1998, and at the same time the Clinton impeachment hearings are playing out in court, 71-year-old Coleman begins an affair with a 34-year-old illiterate janitor, Faunia Farley. Faunia has an ex-husband, a disturbed Vietnam veteran who doesn't take kindly to the news that his ex-wife is shacking up with a man who is more than twice her age. The Athena community isn't thrilled about Coleman's new relationship, either, and once news about the affair gets around, Coleman once again finds himself as the victim of malicious gossip.  After laying out the basic details of this story, author Philip Roth takes things one step further by introducing a secret that Coleman has been keeping all of his life. The lengths Coleman goes to in order to protect his lie are absolutely astounding, and the whole issue makes the allegations of racism that are brought against Coleman take on a whole new meaning.  "The Human Stain" is a brilliant novel that features one surprising development after another. Roth primarily uses the character of Nathan Zuckerman, a friend of Coleman's, to narrate the story, but the reader is also privy to character flashbacks that feature Coleman, Faunia, Faunia's ex-husband Les, and Delphine Roux, a young French professor who was responsible for Coleman's downfall at the college. Roth also chooses to inform the reader of Coleman and Faunia's fates near the beginning of the novel, but the details are revealed in small pieces throughout the rest of the book.  This is a great novel that features many intriguing characters and demonstrates a unique way of telling a story. The comparisons to the Clinton impeachment trial were also very interesting and well-done. Overall, this is a wonderful book...I couldn't put it down 
 First, I'd like to stress that this book, just like its title indicates, is not supposed to appeal to the nostalgia-ridden fans and conspiracy theorists that once found common ground on movies like 'JFK.' Seymour Hersh's 'Dark side of Camelot' is indicting as it is jaw-dropping. In one of the more revealing accounts, Hersh takes on the task of dispelling the peace-loving, freedom-advocate myth surrounding the J.F. Kennedy cult by confirming a long-held, yet underrated perpective that historical events such as the Cuban Missile crisis were in great part exacerbated by the late president and his brother Robert's domestic political ambitions, even when doing so required using the mafia as a reliable ally for the defense of the 'free world' as depicted by the Kennedys. It was  the Kennedys' obsesion to bring Castro down and the urge to appear 'strong of communism' that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war with the prospect of a catastrophic invasion that was planned after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Hersh accounts of US and Soviet generals, CIA officers, and other sources of authority complement this view with chilling details.  The Vietnam war also had Kennedy's fingerprints all over it, according to Hersh's findings. Kennedy's was as eager as Richard Nixon to continue running the war at the expense of hundreds of thousands of lives when the former approved of Vietnamese strongman Diem's murder, although Kennedy was well aware that Diem and his brother had started backchannel negotiations with the communist and buddhist opposition in South Vietnam to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. At the end, Diem's pro-US rivals in the military took over and resumed the reign of terror and reppression that had been encouraged by Kennedy's most hawkish advisers in the Pentagon.   The 'Dark side of Camelot' is not only a political indictment of John F. Kennedy, but also an impeachment on utter immorality by a U.S. head of state. In one of at least four main accounts from ex-Secret Service officers, president Kennedy was courted by members of his cabinet with young club girls who were often threatened with lock-ups in asylums if they dared to speak about their sexual anecdotes with president Kennedy and his entourage. Kennedy's promiscuous behavior opened the door for venereal diseases, such as Chlamydia, to haunt him until the day of his death, according to medical records cited by Hersh.  For revelations like these ones, it is likely that the 'Dark Side of Camelot' be dismissed as a gossip-teller on the sexual life of John F. Kennedy, however, it will prove immensely valuable for those who wish to pursue the trail of elussive puzzle parts that shaped U.S. government policy during some of the most impacting world events of the 20th century                 
 Coming out two years after their debut "Paid In Full", "Follow The Leader" sounds less dated and more fun (and just as influential). Rakim still proves that he's an excellent MC with his revolutionary and influential delivery for the time-period. His lyrical content isn't great, but it's his flow that was so inspirational at the time. Eric B delivers great production which is less dated sounding than his "Paid In Full" work (see "Follow The Leader" for an example) - mainstream rap fans will have a better chance liking this one than their debut. Eric B essentially moves away from the minimalism that was evident on "Paid In Full". The lyrics are sometimes hard to hear, but they're all fun, catchy and always interesting to pay attention to (though not deep at all). If you call yourself a true rap fan then there's a high probability that you'll love this old school classic! Highly recommended!   Highlights include:  the entire album! 
 This large but highly readable work covers the history and context of emerging or re-emerging communicable diseases affecting the world today.  As a physician with a Masters in Public Health I could appreciate the challenge this author faced in presenting this complex and important topic. She has made remarkably few minor technical errors while presenting fields as diverse as virology, immunology and disease ecology in a clear and compelling manner.  She places the emerging diseases in the social, economic and political context that helps to explain why diseases occur where and when they do and why and how they impact individuals and societies.  Although the jacket copy seems to imply a sensationalized account, the story the author tells is a balanced and highly professional one.  In a world grown ever smaller and more tightly connected the issue of communicable disease and public health will impact all our lives and deserves the attention of every citizen.  
 and then when i read to her what i was laughing at, she laughed right along with me.  these essays are pure genius. sedaris really knows how to put his thoughts together and not once did i say "what the hell is he talking about??"  although a few of the bits might be sad to some, thankfully i have the dark sarcastic humor that sedaris requires of his readers.  he is one of my idols.  the essays are different yet tie in together perfectly.  
 By far, Dr. Suess' best.  Too bad this book is not acknowledged and advertised as his other silly books are. By far the best for the simple moral message a child can understand for years.   
 Sisters, to this day, compare and determine themselves as either smart or pretty. It's ongoing and will continue to be so. These two sisters are no exception and the bond that grew between them was surprising and wonderful. This is a light-hearted romp of adventures and misadventures of the two girls, trying to keep the family business afloat after the death of their parents. Add an unexpected plot twist and you're on the way to an interesting, fresh and timely approach to mirror today's obsession with "coffee" and relationships.  There's a completely unrealistic moment with an ATM machine that had me howling. That's what good fiction is all about; kept me jazzed and interested to the end. Valerie Frankel has the right idea. This is the second book I've read of hers; won't be the last. If you're in the mood to laugh, you'll enjoy!  
 The Pulitzer Prize winning poet, Mary Oliver, finishes her poem,"What Have I Learned So Far" with the line, 'Be ignited, or be gone.'To me, this conveys the passion she brings to life and poetry. What comes through clearly in her poems is her reverence for nature.  New and Selected Poems, Volume Two, is a moving collection of her past works combined with many new poems. There is a Zen isness that permeates her work.Haiku like parsimony with no embellishment. Nature does not need anything extra. For example, writing about what she saw after a storm -      And this detail: the body of a duck, a golden-eye; and beside      it one black-backed gull. In the body of the duck, among the breast      feathers, a hole perhaps an inch across; the color within the hole      a shouting red. And bend it as you might, nothing was to blame:      storms must toss, and the great black-backed gawker must eat, and      so on. It was merely a moment. I recently saw Mary Oliver at the 92nd Street 'Y' in New York City where she was reading from this collection. See her if you can. She reads as she writes, with dignity and with passion and wisdom. This is an extraordinary collection of poems.       
 Pasqual's is kitty-corner across Water Street from the St. Francis Hotel in Santa Fe; we time our trips to get into town late at night, but before the St. Francis' bar closes, so we can check in, grab a quick drink, and then roll out of bed the next morning and hit Pasqual's for breakfast.  Tamal dolce, big mug of coffee, newspaper, see if the rocking horse is still in the second floor window of the store across the street (hasn't moved in four years, so far, and counting.) We love Pasqual's, its food, its Ann-Arbor-in-the-Southwest feeling ... and the cookbook is a nice souvenir thereof.  The recipes? Well, plan on mail-ordering a lot of different kinds of chile powder unless you live in New Mexico.  Great stuff, though, if you have the ingredients and the patience 
 I love this CD, one of my favorites.  The other reviewers are right, everyone that listens to it loves it.  Jon Wayne has another CD out called "Two Graduated Jiggers" that you can't find here on Amazon.  It is equally cool but far more bizarre 
 This is THE book that helped me get started on my renewed journey to develop my spiritual self and my understanding of spirituality from an enlightened point of view.  I turned away from structured, dogmatic religion years ago and needed some help in looking beyond organized religion.  I recently joined a Women's Spirituality Group through the Unity Church, and this book was selected for group discussion.  This book has proven to be an invaluable cataylst to open my mind, my spirit, my life to new understandings of spirituality and the spiritual path I want to take.  It is a blessing.

 I don't have this DVD yet (though I want it), and I just wanted to point out to Christopher Fama that he owes me a copy of it: "Find me a woman under 25 who knows 70s Aerosmith lyrics, and I'll buy you this DVD."  I'm 17, and I've got all their albums, and of course I know the lyrics!  Perhaps you shouldn't be so quick to assume that your generation can keep all this good stuff to itself 
 This lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every peny. It is thick, comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion), available in several color choices, and has a soft, not plasticky, cover fabric. You will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. It just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because I had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. But all turned out well and I must say I am very happy with it. It is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper, but much thinner, types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. Get the best. This is it 
 I was prepared to resist this book as "been there, done that," but I was soon drawn in by the creative way Wilder not only charts an emotional and psychological map of coming into one's own as a Power Woman, but illuminates where we are on the spectrum, both personally and in a mythic and social context. I found it validating to see what had gone right as well as awry in my own evolution as a woman in our culture. The deeper I got into the book, the more avidly I took notes, particularly in regard to Wilder's new paradigms of authentic leadership and  profound definition of success. I found this book heartening and revitalizing.   
 Excellant book. I highly recommend it.  To read them is easy,to live them is the challenge.  
 Satan's Silence is simply the best book yet written about the ongoing epidemic of false accusations of child sexual abuse that began in America with the daycare panics -- McMartin, Fells Acres, Little Rascals, etc. -- that swept this country in the 80s. Satan's Silence examines several key cases in detail, explaining what happened and why. It is carefully researched, well reasoned, intelligent and compassionate 
 There were times as I was reading this book that I cringed and thought to myself "How could she be so stupid." But I had to remind myself of her tender age in this story. She did a lot of things at a young age that many of us may never do in our entire lifetime. Prostitution, Pimping and drugs. This book had so much purpose and that's why I call it "One of the best book that I read all year". It's written like a novel so it doesn't come off preachy or like a self help book. Maya Angelou tells a portion of her story. She uncovers layers of clothing and bares the naked truth of her young adulthood. To me this is not just a story of a black woman and a black womans struggles; this is a story about hard knocks and people of all races and nationalities experience them. "Rita" felt like she had to make her own way, she felt like she needed all of the answers at once. No one was going to take care of her and son.  And at the same time, while she felt the burdens of independence, she also felt the emptieness and lonlieness that we all feel some time or another just because we are human. "Rita" made a lot of poor decisions, but that's not the reason that we know her today. We don't know her because she was once a madam on the West Coast, or a prostitute in Stockton, or a cook in Oakland. We know her because she found God's plan for her life and stuck with it. 
 Skeleton Man is another success for Tony Hillerman.  The usual well-planned mystery to solve, and more about three of my favorite characters, Joe, Jim, and Bernie who appreciate the desert so much 
 Ok, I'm and engineer and the science here makes extensive use of  poetic license. However, I find it completely entertaining and  engrossing. The special effects are fantastic (while many are  completely impossible). But I feel that the "story" is a  heart-breaker and tear-jerker. I continue to re-view for the pure  entertainment. Has some great characters. Besides, we get to look  at Liv Tyler a lot. Probably not 5 stars. Four in my book. I gave  it an extra star because I think it's been panned too severely 
 This box set is one of the best ones ever compiled. Short but sweet. It makes one wonder what he would have done if he had lived a few more years. Alas, like all true masters, they are here only here for a short time. The whole box set is an inspiration to all aspiring blues players. Even the people who have been recording and singing blues, look to this man for inspiration. We all know that Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, BB King, Muddy Waters and others all have covered his songs over the years. and have done an excellent job.   These are the original recordings of the blues standards done by the man who wrote them. So enjoy the 
 I had never seen these before. Being born in 1965, I watched Bullwinkle of course, but never saw this show. I love classic TV, weird humor, silent films, etc, and HATE almost everything on cable TV. Reality shows, remakes, predictable sitcoms, trash...not my style. These shows are hosted by Hans Conried, whom I always think of as Wrong Way Feldman. Silent movies are shortened, then funny lines are added. Some film clips are made into fake commercials, others are voiced over with phony direction, fake documentaries, etc. We really enjoyed the first discs, but it was apparent that they didn't have enough old footage back then to use fresh everytime. Certain clips were used over several shows, ie, the plane crashing into a barn, guys balancing and dancing on top of high buildings, and Colleen Moore's famous eye spazz. We see many old time stars get fractured, but I mostly noticed Valentino, Fairbanks, Langdon, Moore, Turpin, and Keaton. (I can never get enough Buster Keaton, so that's no complaint!) Plus the show spent a few minutes interviewing stars of the day, and you'll see Barbara Eden, Bob Denver, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Ursula Andress, Bob Newhart, and more. If you like old movies (with the exception of those snobbish types that would consider this sacriligious), or just like oddball humor or MST3K, and love good old black and white, go for it.  Oh, by the end of the 1st DVD you'll be fast-forwarding through the theme music. it gets REALLY annoying after awhile. What happened to Hans 
 This Book Is What I Call ...Someone Smells Fowl Because He Just Shoveled A Bunch Of BullS_ _ _ . This Man Is A EGOMANIAC. 
 The warmest, most  lasting, and  most  comfortable men's sock  on  the  market!  Excellant  Price $$ 
 This book is very helpful with practical advise about how to live in a cop's family.  It deals with the day to day realities as well as the traumas that go along with living with a cop.  It was an easy read that didnt give a bunch of doctor jargon.  I highly recomend this book to anyone that lives with a cop, is a cop, or just wants to understand what its like to be a cop 
 This text is a concise, well-written, introductory text regarding mass, mole, and energy balances.  Though the book does lack a little as far as its discourse on thermodynamics.  There are a few typos, but that should not distract the reader from learning chemical engineering principles.  Also, this book is a wonderful resource because of its extensive thermophysical properties tables and other important data.  I have used these tables in fluids, kinetics, and heat/mass transfer 
 I bought this book because I am studying to be an electrician.  I like it considerably more than the paperback version it is far easier to find section headings and sub-headings when you are looking for something.  The paper is strong and glossy-white (as opposed to gray and flimsy in the paperback) and headings are in bold type and indented.  That may not sound like much, but it is many times easier to read this version than the paperback version I was supplied to by my school.  The book also features notes about many revisions to the Code from the 2002 edition as well as numerous examples, illustrations, and diagrams of different regulations.  The book is very well constructed, albeit, rather large at 1300+ pages.  If you need to buy a code book, this one will last a lot longer than the paperback one 
 Dean Smith is without a doubt one of the best college basketball coaches in the history of the NCAA. I think the win total speaks for itself, and in this book he tells just how he has made it to that milestone. He gives details on his philosophy and past players weigh in on Smith's coaching. This is good for any young coaches out there, or just basketball fans in general. This book is a must have for anyone that loves basketball 
 I had been looking for a "family" friendly cookbook that included recipes with basic ingredients but was healthy, and included recipes that can be cooked within a reasonable amount of time and would appeal to adults and kids.  This cookbook has great variety, ideas, and should be a part of any family's cookbook collection!  
 If you want to hear an old pro with serious chops, look no further. There are few recordings of Bloomfield in action with the recording quality equal to this. Gavenites' vocals are equal to the task in an Al Kooper sort of way, but Bloomfield is definitely the heart of this CD. 
 In my quest to learn more about the book proposal process, my literary agent recommended Thinking Like Your Editor: How to Write Great Serious Nonfiction--and Get It Published.  If you're interested in writing serious (or not so serious) nonfiction, this is a MUST READ! The Authors don't just go through a step-by-step process of writing a book proposal, but instead get into the "editor" psychology behind why book proposals succeed or don't.  The book is presented in a comfortable format that goes through the big picture process in a narrative format that reminds me of a good lecture. The voice of the author's comes through in a very straight forward, personable way. It's like sitting across the table from your agent or editor, cup of coffee in hand, listening to them tell you how the business works.  I don't think this is the only book you'll ever need on book proposals. If I hadn't read a few other books that discussed proposals from a step-by-step basis first I wouldn't have understood all that the authors say in this one. No, this is more of a next step type of book. Learn how the actual writing process goes first and come to Thinking Like Your Editor with a little knowledge. This title will add an extra and excellent layer on to the information that you already have in your head. 
 This is such an excellent book.  My only fear is that many people do not realize that dieting can cause eating disorders and that's why I wish the book was also in the Health/Diet section of the stores.  However it is NOT a diet book, but teaches us to eat naturally and normally and how to loose weight and keep it off by loving ourselves.  However it is much more than that still.  It helped me realize that my body is unique and may not conform to the cultural ideal.  Thank God for this book 
 I am a big Ty Herndon fan, but this exceeded my expectations... you would never know Ty has been missing from the music world for a few years! He's still at the top of his game, maybe even better than his older music. I love every single song on this album and Ty's voice sounds absolutely flawless. Buy this CD now and request "right about now" from your local country station! This album deserves the airplay 
 I read this book as part of an MBA programme, but it's far, far more than a business book.  In a series of self-examination exercises, Handy teaches how we can all reassess our lives and change the way we live and work.  All  this is achieved in a slim, matter-of-fact volume that puts many other  business and management books (as well as the slew of self-help literature)  to shame, with its erudition and the well-read eclecticism of its author.   Maybe half a dozen books in a lifetime make you change the way you think.   If this isn't one of them, there's no hope for you

 Gorodish and Alba play gods in Jean-Jacques Beineix's Diva.  Gorgeous photography, especially the way that Wilhelmenia Fernandez is illuminated and shot against contrasting backgrounds.  Envision American Beauty's Mina Suvari shot against the velvet richness of rose petals and Annie Leibovitz's portrait of Whoopi Goldberg submerged in a milk bath. This film is almost flawless, excepting the Parisian, Marilyn Monroesque panty shot just for the sake of a panty shot and the miscasting of the female detective 
 The revised edition is excellent, apart from forming a useful catalogue of stereographs to seek out, it is also a wonderful history of the many subjects photographed in 3-D over the years. I rated it at 4 stars rather than 5 because I consider the reduced content of the index to be a retrograde step. Having said that it is a 'must have' for all stereographers 
 It took me a long time to get into the first three Journey albums, but they finally grew on me. This first one takes a little longer than the following two to get into, but still it's a solid release. There are some people who hate the poppy sound that Journey would make with Steve Perry, but can get into this completely, because it's totally light years removed from the Steve Perry fronted sachharin sweet pop group of the early to mid eighties. I like the Steve Perry phase also, but sometimes this progressive rock can be a very refreshing change. I like the songs that Greg Rollie sings from 1978 to 1980, but he does a great job as lead vocalist on the first three albums, including this EP. I've just always thought he had a really cool voice. I think most Journey fans would agree. This isn't as good as the next two albums, but it will work in a pinch. I won't say that this is killer material, but this Greg Rollie fronted lineup is pretty cool and interesting. 
 Quite possibly one of my favorite albums ever recorded!  Being a dyed in the cloth TKK Fan (I See Good Spirits, et al)as well as a fan of Stax Soul, 60's Garage, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and Rockabilly to name a few, I can say with certainty that this should have been a classic.  One of the few that I can listen to over and over without getting sick of.    My oly regret is I wish that they would have had better publicity and really tapped into the Sixties dance, Vampyro Lesbos Trip that was happening when this came out instead of trying to force feed this to the Baby Vamps of Yore.  They could have easily assumed their rightful position ahead of White Zombie and Marilyn Manson and conquered the Dance Scene as well.    A Great Band, A Great Sound.  Cheers 
 This book is hysterical and full of juicy tidbits of drinking lore. Every  drunk should own it 
  This is a very good book and it teaches a very good life lesson. It is a book that can be enjoyed by any type of public. I would especially read this book to a person who is giving up. It will be a very good idea to read this to an infant or a child when they are learning new stuff. This will enourage them to do may more things in life. When I first read this book it taught me that if I propose myself a challenge and I give some of my time and that I never give up I can do anything in life that I want to accomplish 
 Navaho Police Special Investigator Ella Clah is still recovering emotionally after almost dying in a uranium mine.  She hopes to spend more time with her daughter Dawn but when an FBI agent goes missing on the reservation, Ella and her unit gives top priority to finding him.  She doesn't expect too much cooperation from the tribe because Agent Thomas interrupted a medicine man during a Sing (a healing ceremony).  This is a taboo and dealt with severely but after talking to the shaman, Ella clears him of any crimes.  Ella wants to talk to the man who underwent the Sing Melvin Rainwater in connection with the social security checks of dead men that were not reported deceased  sent to a special post office box.  A phone call from Agent Thomas confirms he is still alive and in a dark place, which Ella believes is one of the deserted mines just like she was not so long ago.  She uses all the resources at her disposal to find him, even going so far as to break some laws, but somebody wants to stop her investigation or at least slow it down and they don't care if they harm Ella in the process.  An Ella Clah mystery is always a special treat and WHITE THUNDER is particularly good because the authors bring to life a culture in the same way that Tony Hillerman does.  The investigation is compressed into a short period because the protagonist knows that the victim is running out of time which raises the level of tension and makes the audience feels as they are involved in the search.  This tale is another great mystery by the talented Thurlos.  Harriet Klausner 
 This is a hands-on design book. Great for those that are starting to design or redesign their kitchens(daydreamers too). Included is a split page design that allows you to mix and match wall, floors, and cabinets . It also comes with reusable stickers and layout girds in the front and back of the book.It is jam packed with information to help you solve all of your design dilemmas.  
 This is an excellent book, well written and full of facts.  Not facts about the plays, but about Shakespeare's England.  It follows the course of Shakespeare's life, what was going on around him and the plays he wrote at the time 
 I too bought this wisk since I had read in a review that it was all silicone. But I have been really happy with the quality and also the design.  The shape of the handel makes it a dream to use.  Also I was tired of scratching my Le Creuset pans so it has been a god send 
 Rachel Portman's done it again!  This soundtrack will always be in my "top ten" favorites-- right along with Moll Flanders, Dangerous Beauty, and The Truman Show.  Don't listen to what some people say about it being "repetitive", it's so good, you won't mind listening to the variations on themes. (I don't, anyway.)  I  already liked Ms. Portman's other work from the very first time I saw "Sirens"; but now I really love it!  ~looking forward to more of her musi 
 This story involves two ghosts And some children perhaps their hosts.  Has their young governess gone quite mad? Are or these children possessed and bad?  Questions, questions are all we see No clear answers are going to be.  Henry James wrote this great ghost tale And its worthiness does prevail.  So read this book and get a chill Excellent writing enjoyed still. 
 The words are basic and simple so they are easily accessible to the early reader.  And, of course, kids have always liked the drawings in this book.  This was a favorite of mine as a child and it is one of the first books my son read on his own.  He now enjoys reading it to his brothers 
 I used this text in a course dealing with racial issues in the criminal justice system, Not only was each chapter extremely detailed, while presenting the material in a clear and concise manner. As a Sociology instructor I would highly recommend utilizing this text for courses dealing with issues of race in the criminal justice system 
 Facelift pretty much happened when hair metal was receiving its final nail in the coffin and grundge was becoming more of a household name. The first single of this album was Man in the Box, a great incorporation of guitar, trembling basslines and timely tempoed drumming, and Layne Staley's haunting melodic vocals, Perhaps their hardest song and most famous song that they came out with. This album has a very raw, emotional feel to it. Every song here has its own personality here from psychedelic, too metal and through headbanging. Jerry Cantrell was one of the most underrated guitarist in the new Seattle scene of grunge(although I think basically it was more metal than grunge, simply because it had very few alternative elements then grunge). He knew how to make more than 3 chord progression and had some good solos and licks, and actually wrote the majority of the songs. The bass-lines was very audible, jazzy and crunchy, just listen to Man in the Box to listen to a strong and tremble bass. The drums were very good, Sean Kinney kept every thing on perfect tempo from slow emotional to fast and violent. Layne Staley had a great vocal range from melodic to growlish at points(RIP) Best songs here are We Die Young, Man In the Box, Bleed the Freak,Love Hate love and I know something About you. But this still great from start to finish, and even with the price it has right now pick this up, its classic metal. 
 True, it is bawdy--but so is Shakespeare.  This is a hilarious book, a  chance to ride with a barnstorming ballclub. Each page is drenched with  humor, or with insight which transcends the game, and this group of men.  Rosen's Cockroach Basketball League is also a terrrific read.  He is  clearly the best basketball novelist going 
 Considering the rapid changes of fashion in the 20th century, this is an ambitious work that largely succeeds. Shame on Amazon for listing Christian  Lacroix as photographer. Lacroix only wrote the preface! The book is NOT a  photograph collection; it is all Peacock's artwork. His choices are  probably better in the earlier years. In the later decades he tends to  feature extremes rather than standard wear. I remember the 50s on and never  saw in real life some of the things he depicts. Still it's a beautiful  book! His renderings are charming. He draws the clothing very well (not so  good with hands and feet and his heads vary wildly in size but I niggle) 
 A Step from Heaven  	Young Ju is a young girl who grew up in Korea. She learns about heaven from her Halmoni. Young Ju and her family are moving to America. This is the place where she believes is heaven and there she can see her Harabugi who passed away. When she arrives, she is told that this is not heaven ,but America can be a step from Heaven. Her family settles in and soon her Uhmma gives birth to a boy named Park Joon Ho. Young Ju then goes to school where she learns English and she learns how to be a good sister and help her family. 	I really liked the book. It was very interesting to read about this family and how hard it was for them in many ways. The book also kept me wanting to read more and always wondering what would happen to them. 
 What a great wok...only 1 drawback...not deep enough, but it is a breeze to clean. Thanks 
 Imagine living in Europe during the Dark Ages, when everyone thought the world was flat, and having someone demonstrate to you that the world is a sphere. In our modern version of the Dark Ages of the environment we are  under the delusion that our Earth is lump of rock inhabited by life.  Lovelock shows that the Earth is a living, self-regulating system comprised  of all of life tightly coupled with its environment. He traces the 3.5  billion year life of the Earth as a living entity in an easy and enjoyable  to read fashion. If we as a species are fortunate enough to survive the  next 1000 years it will be because this book was recognized as the most  important ever written in the 20th century. For you Gaia theory buffs out  there: The Gaia theory dawned on Lovelock when he was having a conversation  with Carl Sagan and some other colleagues 
 A very moving book that provides personal histories regarding the suffering of Christians in the Middle East.  The book is full of pathos.  It provides an insight (understanding may be unfortunately impossible) of the effect of the Israeli-Palestine conflict on the Christian community.  Although the book does not take sides in the conflict, the stories clearly do.  (The book also has chapters on the Christians in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, but Israel and Palestine is the bulk of the book.)  I recommend this book for anyone who is interested learning about the people of Palestine (from the view point of a vanishing minority) and in the intransigent nature of the conflicts of the peoples living there.  
 I have arthirtis of the spine (ankylosing sponditis) and been told by  doctors that there is no cure just PT.  Dr Murray gives you an explanation  of what went wrong, (while my disease is genetic why doesn't everyone with  the gene get it?), nutritional vitamins and finally a diet to help and  somewhat reverse the tide. Has it helped?  In the two weeks I bought this  book it has; my pain is less, much less, and while I am not totally  faithful I am beginning to become a devout convert.   If you have arthrits,  ulcerative colitis (ra and uc are genetically related) or uncontrolled  allergies, this man knows how to handle them.  I've searched everywhere and  he has the answer. Get this and the Balch Natural Remedies book and mate,  you'll be right :- 
 The book in my opinion coming from a calculus III student is very rigorous and one needs to have a firm foundation on Mathematics I would say about calc III or better to even try to read this book. So far I have just started but every page is exciting because he goes into a deep explanation of what is happening and going on physically and mathematically. Not to mentioned his work is very organized 
 Superb.  One of the finest novels I've read.  Trollope's most popular work and the second in the Chronicles of Barset series.  I never read the first one "The Warden" and didn't feel like I needed to, the first couple chapters of Towers supply enough background to know what happened in the first book, at least in a broad sense.  Initially, the backdrop of a looming clerical power struggle in the pastoral English town of Barchester and environs is convincingly weighty.  However, as this power struggle plays out it becomes apparent that Trollope is for the most part poking fun at players on both sides of the battle.  He reminds us that despite the detachment and solemnity that such a conflict deserves, it's only human to be looking out for one's own interests as most of the characters end up doing.  Trollope accomplishes this through brilliant characterization and a rich plot that keeps the reader interested and never bogs down.  Towers is incredibly humorous, both in the dialogue of the characters and in Trollope's third person omniscient narration.  There were so many scenes of dumbfoundingly witty humor that if I didn't have other books to move on to I'd go back through and catalog all of the humorous bits for posterity.  Dickens' "Pickwick Papers" is just as humorous, but it's more slapstick and deals more with situations.  Trollope's humor is in wordplay and hyperbole.  For example, when the awkward and unattractive Mr. Slope is soon to declare his love for the stunningly beautiful Signora Neroni, he takes her hand and this is how Trollope describes it:  "Mr. Slope was big, awkward, cumbrous, and having his heart in his pursuit, was ill at ease.  The lady was fair, as we have said, and delicate; everything about her was fine and refined; her hand in his looked like a rose lying among carrots, and when he kissed it he looked as a cow might do on finding such a flower among her food."  I will never forget the analogy of a woman's hand in a man's looking like a rose lying among carrots.  Most of my friends aren't readers so I don't often enthuse to them about novels I've enjoyed, but you can bet I'll be recommending this to them as one of many reasons books are far worthier of one's time than TV and movies.   This is one of those for which I can be jealous of anyone who'll be reading it for the first time.  Don't miss it.  Also, Trollope was a prolific writer and I've heard he's got a couple other gems.  Based on other reviews, I added "The Last Chronicle of Barset", "The Way We Live Now", and "He Knew He Was Right" to my collection 
 This is a great companion to Freke's book with Peter Gandy, The Laughing Jesus, Religious Lies and Gnostic Wisdom.  The book may not change your life singlehandedly but it can surely deepen one's spiritual understanding 
 I really enjoyed this book and found it very helpful for improving my technique.  It's a fast read and deserves to be read a couple of times.  The author/editor points out that there are several conflicting opinions given, but like anything in life you need to find the one that works best for you.  It's good to see that the editor didn't think he had to just give the most popular opinion.  I highly recommend this book for riders looking to step up their training 
 I'm not using the gel - it's expensive and doesn't worth it. instead I'm using a regular shaving gel and the shaving is very good for me. I'm usually using it in the shower 
 I purchased this battery as a back-up to the one that came with the camcorder. The great thing about this is, once charged, it can sit in a camcorder for a month without loosing any power. I discovered this last week when I wanted to use the camcorder and was worried that the battery may be dead by now but ...surprise surprise. Its recharge time is very fast.  The only negative part (if I must have to give) is, it's a little bigger then the one that comes with camcorder.  I say go for it.  
 Great book!  San Francisco detective Lindsey Boxer and three of her successful female friends form the "Women's Murder Club" as a means of pulling their resources to solve the tragic and bizarre murders of several newlywed couples.  Not only do they do just that, they also form a bond of friendship that looks to last a lifetime.  There are several unexpected turns and twists to this plot and just when you think you've rounded the last turn, Patterson throws another one right in your face.    My only complaints are as follows:   1)  While James Patterson did a very good job of narrating from the female point of view - I mean after all, he's a man - I felt the women were a bit too confident and they all got along too well.  I mean come on, even the most confident of us have doubts about the silliest of things in our lives and we all know how "catty" women can be - It's simply a female thing.    2)  The love interest that develops between two of the characters went from 0 to 60 way too fast for me.  I know we only have 300+ pages to get things going, but I felt the author could have spent a little more time developing the relationship.  It seems like they went from their first meeting to "scoring" at the ballgame in the turn of a page.  Don't get me wrong, the relationship was great, I just wish it had developed on a more realistic timeline.      
 As a person who not only plays music (rock, jazz, classical, blues, country, etc.) but has been collecting music with over 700 CD's in the collection, I rarely like to simply dole out the 5 star ratings without some scrutiny; but, let's be honest, Andy Timmons has the chops to compete with the all-time greats (Vaughn, Vai, Satriani, Keaggy, Hendrix, Gilbert), and something else that many of them lack (especially today's players). That is: melodic sense. I like speed, sure, adding to the prowess of this musician as a technical giant, but a song has to have a point to it to be a great song. Andy gets that point.  I just finished listening to this CD for the first time after having just recieved it in the mail, and I was floored! No question Andy has the technicality to insert the mindblowing riffs with extreme precision exactly where they are needed, but he has the where-with-all to understand the places in the story (the song, that is) that need one single, perfect note placed within the chord, or maybe even, yes...silence.  As with other CD's from this amazing guitarist, this one is also a must have.  For those who want to dig a little deeper into Andy:  Particularly good other selections from Andy include "Ear X-tacy" (melodic metal instrumentals, one crazy kick-butt country-rock tune, and an awesome tribute song to Stevie Ray Vaughn, among others), "Pawn Kings" (if you like bluesy, sometimes southern flavored rock-and-roll - 1/2 of songs with lyrics), "The Spoken And The Unspoken" (more melodic rock instrumentals with some alternative-rock influence on the songs with lyrics), and, of course, the acclaimed "That Was Then, This Is Now" compilation (almost all melodic hard rock instrumentals, some bluesy-jazz-rock influences). Try it, love it, understand 
 I am the author of "Thinkertoys," and "Cracking Creativity," and, generally read every book on the market that addresses creativity in the corporate world. "Positive  Turbulence" is one of the best of the best on the market today. It  should be read by everyone who is interested in helping organizations  become more innovative in everything they do. Bravo, to the author for  producing a significant contribution to the field 
 I picked this up because it contained the rest of the session gave us Bags' Groove.  The Man I Love is the highlite in my opinion.  I love the sound of Miles and Milt together.  'Round Midnight is played by the original Miles Davis Quintet and does not belong in this collection, it's fantastic but it's out of place here.  Besides, I already had it on "The Miles Davis Quintet Legendary Prestige Sessions".  If you have Bag's Groove then you definitely want to own the rest of the session plus, you get to hear the players muff the first take of "The Man I Love" and the ensuing bickering between Miles and Monk.  Just a comment on the "CD or NOT CD" review.  Sir:  You are very arrogant to go questioning the chops and abilities of a man like Monk.  It's perfectly fine to write "I don't get Monk".  I write that sort of thing all the time and in fact, I don't really get Monk overall but I love his writing.  Without Monk we wouldn't have "Round Midnight and The Miles Davis Quintet's reading of that chart.  That recording is without question one of the great recordings in recorded American music.  Anyone who really understands "jazz" and American music knows this is a fact.  Monk was a genius whether you and I "get him" or not.  Also, comparing one musician to another is just plain dumb.  Of course they are different, they are two different souls following the Muse in their own way.  Comments like your's really rile me, I've read similar things written about Eric Dolphy, an indisputable genius who's music only the priviledged few ever "get" 
 Some of the negative reviews would have turned me off this book if I had read them first. I have enjoyed this book, the Vampire, Geall setting did not turn me off. Actually It was a nice change.  I enjoy contempory, historical, mystical and I guess Vampire. Yeah Nora for having more of a read than in some of your latest books 
 In today's world where we think we know so much, one truth is overlooked. Our basic design as humans is we all feel the need to be loved. As children, we show we are open searchers of how things work. Maria Simma is a simple woman in her life, living in an isolated site on an Austrian hillside, earning her meager income plucking feathers from birds as pillow stuffing. Yet, she prays alot, much as her mother showed her. In a world, where we are so unaware of the Spiritual seed planted in all of us, Maria prays alot. And, because of this and her simple wordly nature, Souls visit her to seek help. They all want to finally enter Heaven, but they need some special few deeds done in their favor. How this unfolds and is related in this heart-changing book are tales that change our outlook to life 
 First I would like to say there is NO ONE SIZE FIT ALL. I make a living as a mortgage broker, Insurance agent. My Hobbies is Investing ( rental properties, stocks). I would like to say that Mr. Andrew's using Home Equity is on the RIGHT TRACK. With Real Estate, I always trying to buy an investment as little down as possible, and using mortgage type that requires MINIUM PAYMENT as low as possible. For stocks I made good return for the last few yrs. CIEN, SNDK, and swing trade GOOG, APPL options. using my ROTH IRA, for longterm stocks, and regular stock acct. for option) I also have EIUL too. to cover death benefit if something happen to me incase I die before reaching retirement age. My family will have the cash to pay my DEATH TAX. (ESTATE TAX) most CFP bash this strategies is because how they make money?(by you buy and sell your fund every year) If you buy insurance they will make less money from you.  As an insider of this field, I would like to say: DO NOT PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN 1 BUCKET.  and the important part is When you get your money out at 65 yrs. old. the LAST STAGE of your FINANCIAL is the NET (Distributing stage), not how much return I get Accumulating stage. my strategies is like this 1-Max. out my funding ROTH IRA. 3000/yr. as self employed individual. (if you work for Corp. just put enough funding as the corp. require so they can match your 401K, if not I don't put money in 401K.) 2-BUY LIFE INSURANCE (from highly RATE companies), AS YOUNG AS POSSIBLE and AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE (because it cheaper, and you will need it anyway, you can not buy when u needed it)  BUY MORE BENEFIT TERM LIFE, but still need some permanent Ins. Example: if you need 2 Million death benefit Buy 1.75 Million 10-30 yrs term, 250K EIUL, MAX FUNDING your EIUL.  3-Investing in REAL ESTATE. Down as little as possible, with MORTGAGE program require monthly pmt as low as possible. REMEMBER BEFORE INVEST, You will need to pay off all credit cards, and have 6 months RESERVE for your monthly expenses. HOPE THIS WILL HELP some people will like do other invest vehicle (to open business, collecting wine, coins, etc.) thanks for reading, just remember   DO NOT PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN 1 BUCKET. NO ONE SIZE FIT ALL.  this is WHAT I LIKE TO DO WITH MY MONEY, NOT SUGGESTING ANYONE TO DO IT.

 The reviews Amazon has on this product was very helpful for me to select some fun DVD's for my grandchild.  The 6yr old boy loves watching these movies it is a special treat.  The movie has some good messages and inspires his racing imagination 
 George Strait is awesome.  This was a pleasure to watch.  Wish I could have been there LIVE 
 We know that things are outrageously corrupt and out of joint in Washington D.C. but we have hoped that by patiently enduring-and by voting for the presumed lesser of two evils-matters might settle down and maybe the corruption, at least, wouldn't be so visible. Then Arianna Huffington has to come along and write "Pigs at the Trough". Now I suppose we will have to do something.  Huffington spares no one in this book; there are no sacred cows-no sacred Democrats and no sacred Republicans. About the only politician who seems to come through Huffington's expos unscathed is Republican Senator John McCain. I guess I will have to vote for him if he ever gets past his party's primary system and runs for president. Huffington documents so much corruption and waste, billions upon billions of dollars of it, that it is frankly amazing to me that we have any money at all left in the national treasury (oh, we don't). Lobbying and campaign donations have given the greediest, most immoral elements of American society, the CEOs, carte blanche in our nation's capitol. This inbreeding of greed has created a new class in America (actually, it has resurrected an old class from the robber baron days), the corrupt class, which is composed of the Boards of Directors and CEOs of public corporations and the politicians and government appointees who hop in and out of public and private sector jobs whenever they need to tweak a law in order to line their own pockets. If you knowingly commit an act which is harmful to the nation, isn't that called treason?  It all seems too overwhelming. Huffington attempts to divert the despair by including six pages of contact information for various organizations whose missions are to combat this oh-so-transparent corruption. Among my criticisms of "Pigs at the Trough" are that Huffington tries to use humor to keep things light but her humor reads more like sarcasm, which I found to be more annoying than funny. She includes too many cutsie inset boxes with sarcastic quizzes-these boxes disturb the reading pace and don't really add anything substantive to the book. In some places, she rounds up politicians with her sarcastic lasso without fully exposing or documenting their wrong-doing. These may be just low-level corrupt politicians; virtual saints when compared with more transparently corrupt politicians, like our current administration. Nevertheless, the book is full of facts; useful facts to have ready during the next election cycle. 
 This is the fourth story I've read by Susan Henderson, and they all rock.  Susan writes prose the way that Clapton plays the guitar.  Her voice pulls readers in, and her story holds us tight, and when it ends, we find ourselves wanting another one - and soon.  Susan Henderson is going to be an unstoppable literary force.. 
 I liked the information this book offered, particularly because I believe it would be helpful to anybody teaching children--educators, parents, tutors, etc.  You don't have to have a certain curriculum package to make this work.  I LOVE having resources around that you don't have to read cover to cover.  This is one that you can look up what you have questions on.  Sometimes, when a student doesn't "get" something, it is only because it isn't presented in a format they understand.  Often, the educator just needs a different tactic than what appears "obvious" to them, but not to the child.  A great reference.  
 "Spring Snow" was brilliant and breathtakingly beautiful. "Runaway Horses" was Spartan, brave and controversial. "Temple of Dawn" was somewhat boring, but decadent in an atractive sort of way.  Here comes the last part, which is a real culmination of the tetralogy. It is intellectually stimulating, highly mystical and very personal. Is it also very sad and pessimistic. It is a book about death and nihilism. Main characters are brilliant. It is of course Honda - the man of Reason, who is more real and attractive and complete as a person than in any previous book, but also a rich hedonistic lesbian destroyed by old age, Toru - the last reincarnation of Kiyoaki, who lost all his powers of uncompromising life and beauty, mad ugly girl, who believes she is very beautiful, mysterios enlightened Satoko, and the main protagonist of the novel - Japan the Great that greadualy lost her uniqueness and tradition and spirit during the infamous XX century and now is close to death.  Particulary powerful is the scene when Honda visits beach made famous by ancient No play about the decay of the angel, and discovers that this harmonic holy place is desecrated by tourists with countless fast-food bags and Cola cans scattered all over it. Also the last few pages is the very best ending I've ever read.  And dont forget about translation. Seidensticker is really superior to any other translator from Japanese to English 
 I read this book several years ago and have re-read it several times.  It is one of those books you pick up when you are a little bit sad or cynical, and it makes you laugh and cry and feel better about the world.  The characters all seem like real people by the time you are through with the book.  I absolutely love it (her other books are good too, but this is my favorite).  And the recipes in the back are WONDERFUL!!!  It's a must-read.: 
 Great 1980 'new wave' classic.About as good as their 'Are We Not Men...' effort(see my review).Noticed that 'Freedom...' seems to have a more polished sound to it.Sure miss Mark Mothersbaugh and crew,their live shows are certainly a fun event to attend.Most impressive cuts here are,without a doubt "Girl U Want",the video channel staple "Whip It",title track "Freedom Of Choice","Mr.B's Balloon" and "PLanet Earth".Everybody get out their power domes!Long live Devo! 
 This group of folks can get music out of seemingly impossible objects including cutting vegetables as well as a deck of cards. A truly unique form of entertainment. Highly recommend 
 I could not put this book down.  To date, I've probably given about 10 copies away to different friends as gifts, and all have been more or less mesmerized.  The information (written by a British "evolutionary biologist"--whatever that is) tells us that every sexual move we make (whether with others or alone) is dictated by some primal and subconscious urge to put forth our very best genetic efforts for the creation of successful and prolific progeny who will then propogate other successful and prolific progeny.  It can get a little bogged down in places.  However...whew! After reading this (which I recommend), it will be impossible to just lay back and enjoy it ever again without wondering what subconscious game you're both playing 
 I found this book to be very special and one that can be read over and kept. I think it is Rolheiser's best 
   As a student at Oklahoma State University, I am very interested in journalism and broadcasting.  Eric Alterman's book opens my eyes to many new ideas about conservative and liberal media.  The purpose of the book is to inform people of the different bias parts in the media.  Alterman does a wonderful job of showing both the conservative side and the liberal side in the media.  After reading through the book, I came to discover that the liberal media is looked at differently than I look at it.  I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning about the different views in the media 
 In The Vast Enquiring Soul: Explorations Into The Further Reaches Of Consciousness, Ronald Russell argues compellingly for the including of the human soul into everyday thought and conversation, that any scientific concept of the world will remain incomplete unless taking the soul into consideration. Russell evaluated current consciousness research by scientists, philosophers, paranormalists, theologians, poets and historians, and found that consciousness doesn't reside only in the brain, but within the whole body, the earth, and the universe. The Vast Enquiring Soul is an informative, articulate, fascinating, and at times inspiring, contribution to metaphysical studies and the nature of human consciousness 
 "1999" is often called Prince's "breakthrou" album but those of us in the r&b community had known about this prodigy since his 1st album, "FOR YOU" releashed in 1978.Heck, true Prince fans still remembered the time he was booed off stage, while opening for the "Rolling Stones". I guess America was'nt ready for something fresh and exciting at the time. But in 1983 apparrently it was.The first 3 songs "1999","Lil Red Corvette", and "Delirious" get this album off to a roaring start and the party never stops 
 essential reading for the open thinker.  cartoons are like folk music, non-frontal assault on attitudes.  people, this the "commons", support this guy or he'll do something less useful!   
 David Sedaris just might be the funniest man alive.  Me Talk Pretty One Day, my inaugural experience into the wonderful world and crazy ways of David Sedaris, is the definitely best book I've read in quite a while--if you can call it a book, since it's a collection of short essays and you can jump around at your whim. I absolutely love his writings, and reading these completely normal life experiences viewed through the lens of amusement, outlandishness, and uncanniness makes me wish that I, too, could be such a good storyteller. His view on life is so unique, and I don't even know what to call his style of humor-- ironic, witty, clever, a bit scathing, self- deprecating? He's all that and more-- his stories, based on his weirdly-- dare i say-- normal life experiences, are sufficiently embellished (for after all, what is good storytelling but the art of translating reality into a new medium?) but completely unpretentious and tastefully subtle. He's down- to- earth and doesn't try to be deep or philosophical, but he obviously has great insight into the human condition, particularly its template of idiosyncrasies, and he amplifies, explores, exploits them quite remarkably. Quirky is the best word to describe Sedaris, and you will have to read to believe, because his stories and why they are funny is oddly indescribable. I could not read a single page of Me Talk Pretty One Day without laughing out loud several times (and draw strange looks from those around me wondering what on earth could be so funny), and I although I find myself wanting to share his comedic genius with everyone I know, I find that I really cannot quote his writing out of context-- he takes things and runs with them; his rhythm is so fully engaging and fluid that it picks you up immediately doesn't stop until you get to the end of the story. So instead of telling people why he's great, I'm resigned to saying: you just have to read it and you'll know what I mean.  I find his writings refreshingly optimistic as well, reaffirming that the key to getting through life is probably just the simple art of not taking oneself too seriously. If you can remain un-jaded no matter what annoying, unfortunate, or sad cards life deals you, if you know how to laugh forever, then you, by the grace of your capacity for amusement, will always be able to find joy in the little things. Whether Sedaris is recalling his darkest days ("Twelve Moments in the Life of the Artist) in which he's deep within the throes of drug addiction, painful moments like his mother's death ("The Youth in Asia"), his frustration at having to battle both the mediocre (the writing class in "The Learning Curve") and the irrational (Valencia in "The Great Leap Forward"), he always retains a warm sheen of optimism that you know is impossible to lose. My favorite story from Part I is "The Youth in Asia"- the nostalgia is palpable here, as is the insight into the nature of grief, growing up, and moving on. Part II, a collection of his experiences in Normandy and his trying attempts to learn French, really made me stop and ponder about linguistics-- about how words bite into reality, about the intricacies, nuances of meaning, and cultural implications of languages in general. Not to mention that his experiences with thoughts and intentions getting lost in translation are entirely hilarious: "...the rabbit of Easter. He bring of the chocolate."  If the stories compiled in Me Talk Pretty One Day were pitched in a musical key, they would be united in the warm, happy key of E flat Major-- no matter what kind of tale Sedaris is recollecting, no matter what the mood of the story, his wit is razor sharp, yet his cleverness doesn't bite- it is instead warm and subtle, reminding us never to ourselves-- or life-- too seriously...because we'll never get out alive (sorry, I had to say that).  I can't wait to read the rest of his books, particularly Naked and The SantaLand Diaries. If you love great storytelling and love to laugh, then you'll love the writings of David Sedaris. I have to warn you, though: you might laugh so hard that you'll need to have your jaw reattached later, but it's well worth it. What can I say, you'll just have to read it to know what I mean. Enjoy the book, and I'll see you again yesterday. 
 Sean Connery shines as does the cinematography. A terrifying story of what's happening to our enviornment. To think such a discovery could be made only to be destroyed by man isn't too far a stretch. The music is perfect and memorable. I've viewed it so many times I know the dialog...and I have the music memorized. 
 If you like fact reading, you'll like this.  I thought he was to discriptive and went on and on and on about nonsense. Some of the info was really good, but it was hard to stay focused and really take it all in.  I found my mind wondering and thinking about other things. 
 A good product with a trusted name. When the time comes to add xD Picture Cards to my inventory, I'll gladly come back for more

 Stack the logs is a powerful, heartwarming, inspirational book on how to achieve what you believe even amid adversity in your life. It shows how to take the negative and turn it into postitive results. I highly recommend this book and the bonus is, it will not only help you in your goals and achievements, but purchasing this book helps St. Jude help others. Frank demonstrates how to keep moving forward and his inspiration is multigenerational, with the story of both his father's illness and words of encouragement, and the illness of his son. Don't miss this one 
 Down II is by far the best mix of blues and metal I have ever heard.  The rifts alone are a kick ass mix of Southern blues and metal that make you wanna get in a mosh pit.....Anselmo is awesome in Down, more so than Pantera!  "Beautifully Depressed," "Ghosts of Mississippi" show the true range of Anselmo's voice, and how blues and metal can truely mesh to make a kick ass album that screams, "BUY ME! 
 I ordered a half size larger than I wear and these fit perfectly.  Nice and warm.  Very comfy shoes right out of the box.  I love Born shoes and these Clarks fit much the same as the Borns 
 Although I don't consider myself a professional gambler, I am a very well-read amateur. I've read almost everything about the subject worth reading. Michael Konik's writing is head and shoulders above other authors who write about this subject. He's funny and entertaing but also informative, even if you think you already know everything about gambling. All my friends who like casinos get Konik's books for Christmas. Can't wait for his next one 
 I bought this book for my kids because it looked interesting to me. The art is great. The story is entertaining, and true. The story is very interesting and one I've heard of before. The end of the book hit me in the same way as the first time I read the Polar Express as an adult. The story ends with Phillippe doing a free show for the public as punishment for walking between the towers, and then a drawing of the New York skyline minus the towers. It simply reads, and now the towers are gone. It's a good story with an ending that makes me sad every time I read it 
         These are my thoughts on a cd called uncle kracker. On e song on the cd is Follow Me track 4. This song is a slow song but it is one you would like. This cd was dedicated to is daughter named Skylar. If I had to rate this track I would rate it a 5 out of a 5. A overall rating of the best would be an A.           This song has no hidden tracks and a great price $13.98. This cd was released June 3,2000. Over those four years theres been over 4000 cds sold across America. The rating they give this cd is 31/2 stars. If you go to amazon.com , you could rate this cd your self.           This cd is a pop, rock like track. My impression on this cd before I listened to it was ok. After I listened to it I thought that this track was a great cd to relax to. There is eleven songs on this cd and all of them are good, great songs. The people who buy this track you will be happy because no matter what you will not be disappointed for buying a $13.98 cd.            This cd can be compared to Kid Rock. Kid Rock and Uncle Kracker are good friends. This track will be good for a party or just to listen to. It will be one of the best tracks you will buy. Hey I bought it and I love it {NO NAMES}. So does my friend and next door neighbor. Have luck in buying one of the cd's and have fin.  
 I can't believe the bad review someone else gave this. Is he listening to the same record? I have never heard a bad mountain-Leslie West album in my 40 years of life. Missisippi Queen is one of the best songs ever.. ever. This live version just proves this. Crossroader is a firey jaunt that could raise the dead. Buy this album and hold on for dear life, then go buy some of his others 
 I just finished re-reading The Gunslinger. I must confess that when I read it for the first time I was not impressed. I have decided to re-read it after I have read the first 4 books and Surprise! Surprise! it was much more interesting. I think the reason behind it is that I have got to know Roland better from the book 4 - Wizard and Glass (about his past). It helped to understand The Gunslinger. In the introduction and foreword of this new edition S. King mentions The Lord of the Rings a few times and that he wanted to write as great book or better. To tell truth, while reading the following books, I felt an influence of Tolkien, which is a positive sign.  This edition is very well made. It has a beautiful dust jacket and many "odd" pictures inside. They are trying to convey some of the ideas of the book but sometimes they are so obscure it is hard to understand what the artist wanted to tell us. All in all, in my opinion The Gunslinger is a great book and a good start for great story. 
 been looking off and on for this cd. SO was very happy with it 
 Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass reveals Whitman's passion for nearly every aspect of life, from amazement of great ships to the enchantment cast by the beauty of a sunset.  The juxtaposition of ideas from line to line creates a vivid imagery throughout the poetry that gives the reader a sense of life as a whole; Whitman describes the broadness and complexity of his own experiences and thoughts with ease.  Large sections of the collection are devoted to discussion of a broad array of subjects.  For example, section three, entitled "Song of Myself", extends for about fifty pages and poems within the section are distinguished only by numbers.  Although the numbers work to separate the ideas found in the passage, the thoughts still flow into one another, causing the text to present a challenging and sometimes exhausting read.  However, other sections such as "Whispers of Heavenly Death" give relief from the dense material.  These contain shorter poems with titles that usually aim to indicate the theme of the poem.  They are more concise and easily understood, because Whitman appears to organize his thoughts, condense them, and put each one into a titled poem.  Overall, the entire collection presents classic free verse poetry that retains timeless concepts and revelations of human emotions.  And because of the grand style and often elevated language in the declarations Whitman uses to communicate his position on elements such as life, death, emotion, nature, heroes, love, politics, etc., the collection could be seen as something near contemporary epic poetry.   	Leaves of Grass also demonstrates Whitman's incredible self-awareness; the lines in the poem "O Living Always, Always Dying" are an example of his confidence as they state, "O me, what I was for years, now dead, (I lament not, I am content;)  O to disengage myself from those corpses of me, which I turn and look at where I cast them, to pass on, (O living! always living!) and leave the corpses behind."  The importance of this self-assurance is that Whitman creates a more stable bond between himself and the reader, because when he gives his advice the reader becomes more liable to accept it as a plausible truth.   	This collection of poetry has much to offer to a variety of readers.  Since it is so broad based, anyone should be able to read it and find some concept of interest.  Whitman himself appears in his poetry as a diverse individual, and therefore more people can make a connection with him.  And even if there happens to be little for one to relate to, the beautiful descriptions and classic language themselves can become valuable souvenirs in the reader's memory.     
 This album is a delight from start to finish. I am not a jazz music lover, but enjoyed all the tracks, as the music is easy to listen to, without it getting too overbearing. Sample and Hathaway make a great duo 
 This is my favourite Gloria Estefan album. I prefer her Spanish language songs. I like her English language songs too, but her voice seems to have even more colour when she sings in Spanish. It has a quality which hits me right in the heart. The first song 'Por un Beso' is a great opener. It's a sad song, but it also conveys a sense of strength, a determination to cope with disappointment: the singer tells her lover that she's going to leave him because she has caught him kissing abother woman, and yet she wishes him well. 'Como Me Duele Perderte' has a sad melody, very evocative. I love the spirit of 'Te Tengo A Ti', which is one of the most danceable numbers on the album. But the sweetest tune is probably 'Tres Gotas De Agua Bendita'. All the other songs are great, but the final song (in its first version) rounds off the collection perfectly. It's not out of place. It's less of a story song than the others: it's a celebration which comes after all the heartache and emotion of the real life and romance featured already. 'No Me Dejes De Querer' has an infectious rhythm. This really proves that a caribbean soul is not an alma de roca! It's wonderful. The flores mix which comes after reduces the same song to a simple dancefloor number: but that has its place too. I think this album is flawless, but it has me floored 
 Nice remixes, especially by Grips, Xenomania, and Phat N' Phunky. A good buy for Cher fans and Madonna fans, like me. Not only do you get the album version, you get 9-count 'em, 9-remixes of this fantastic song. BUY IT NOW!! 
 A Son Called Gabriel By: Damien McNicholl  I had the privilege of receiving this book in the mail from Damien's publicist Joan. She had read some of my stuff here at Bella and thought that I could read and review Damien's book. Was I surprised when I did a little research on the book before it came. Damien's book, A Son Called Gabriel, was chosen as one of Advocate magazine's summer reads. So some of you may have already read it. So, after digging around a bit and talking about the book with Joan, I became very interested in reading it. Unfortunately summer classes got in the way along with some health problems and I wasn't able to read his book as quickly as I would have liked. But a black widow's bite, and Public Speaking behind me, I sat down and read this little gem of a novel.  The story is obviously centered around a young bloke named Gabriel. This is his story. It is a story of coming to terms with one's self being a homosexual. Set in the wonderful distant land of England, Gabriel struggles not only with himself, but with his family. He searches for a place for himself inside of his very entertaining and somewhat dysfunctional family. Damien presents a wonderfully compassionate and endearing tale that catches you from page one. Unlike similar stories, Damien grabs your attention and hold on to it through the end of the book. He makes you want to flip the page in order to read what is next to come. He makes you fall in love with Gabriel, a boy who is very sensitive, gets bullied at school and on the playground, and is constantly tormented because he'd rather play tag or other games with the girls instead of being rough and tumble playing football with the boys. What grabbed me was the fact that I could totally understand and comprehend Gabriel because I could see myself in Gabriel. I could compare our lives and how we developed as gay men. And like myself, Gabriel achieves success in fighting off the bullies and overcoming that difficult stage in almost any sensitive child's life. But one victory does not lead to another. Damien well writes the struggle of the internal soul. The soul that fights against what it feels because the church it belongs to says it is an abomination. That being gay is like being a child molester or the most perverted of society. With the internal struggle comes the external. Through countless escapades with both genders, dealing with the ultra-catholic mother and family, and with sexual abuse of his own, Gabriel becomes the man he was intended to be.  So why don't you go grab yourself a copy and join in on discovering life through the eye's of young Gabriel. This tale is sure to thrill you as it did me. You are bound to find some piece of yourself in this wonderful tale spun together by a magnificent freshman author named Damien McNicholl. The story will remind you of the best times, and remind you of the worst. But you won't be disappointed when you open the cover and loose yourself in Gabriel's tale.  A definite read that would be a sin to miss!  5 out of 5 triangles is what I give this story. Well done Damien!  Jase ;0)  Jason P. Ruel 
 "Core Performance" was a great introduction to core fitness, nutrition and lifestyle.  No complaints - well written, concise...  good book 
 Jim Fall's TRICK is a standout romantic comedy amongst many others with all-too stereotypical characters and storylines.  Christian Campbell (Gabriel) and J.P. Pitoc (Mark) work very well together on-screen in this story of finding love in the most unlikely of circumstances.  Perhaps the most refreshing part of this film is its avoidance of graphic intimacy to convey its message -- while those scenes aren't bad, Jim Fall manages to create in TRICK a film that lets you laugh and enjoy the company that Gabe and Mark share without being disappointed that more didn't happen.  Indeed, Gabe and Mark are interrupted at every turn when they try to spend their first night alone, but begin to realize that this quality time is what many relationships lack.  Truly, the only disappointment in this film is that you're left patiently waiting for the second date.  Tori Spelling costars in this witty, fun comedy about one evening that neither Gabe nor Mark will soon forget.  Relax and enjoy this one 
 I predict this book will become a classic in its field. It not only explains why death has remained such an enigma, but it also ties together many paranormal/spiritual loose ends and makes a great deal of sense to boot. Novak takes readers by the hand and leads them on a mind blowing journey, examining evidence from all relevant fields. These include past life research (reincarnation), near death experience, modern psychology, scientific and medical research, parapsychology and philosophy, out of body experience, myths and legends, archeology and Egyptology, shamanism and mysticism and paranormal phenomena, plus religious texts and holy books from all over the world. Novak leaves no stone unturned and pieces of life's greatest puzzle appear like magic at every turn of the page, leaving readers breathlessly awaiting more. This builds into an identifiable picture of what actually happens after death. And perhaps more importantly, Novak also explains why this natural process is a necessary part of spiritual evolution 
 Yeah... I like this one... it is so choice... if you have the means I highly recomend picking one u 
 Finally The strokes have come out with the essential package we've all been waiting for. There debut from 1968 and all 13 albums since then have been ignored when it comes to a greatest hits package. The hits are all on this one. I'm sure it'll be number one on billboard cuz its so good 
 Stargate Atlantis is great. I like the idea of downloading the episodes, but put in all the seasons. Why leave out season 2? 
 Have been through the complete book and over all it is excellent. 
 I don't think I have ever read a book so quickly.  This was a very nice easy read.  Great twist and turns.  Enjoyed.  
 A fantastic book with hard hitting and realistic approaches to the most difficult "war" you could ever imagine.  Don't let anyone tell you it's not a war, because it is, and it is the only one that will ever matter to you.

 Totally psychotic Wedding Dress designer kills his models to 'find himself', but his horrible wife has her own willpower to wield. Bava's direction parallels the edge of John's insatiable drive to Kill, an assaultive film experience. Low budget. Horrible sound, so play it loud! (6/7 
 This little book couldn't be any more straightforward or useful.  Over the span of 500 pages, each page is devoted to a different artist, with one representative work by that artist and a short description of his or her life and work.  At the end, an invaluable 6-page glossary provides short and informative descriptions of the major genres and schools of art (e.g., Fauvism, Constructivism, Expressionism, etc.) that don't require a PhD to understand, as well as explanations of common art materials and techniques (e.g., gesso, fresco, tempera, etc.).  It's a great value, and much more inexpensive than almost any other art book this informative.  Buy it now

 This text was assigned as part of a college history course.  As part of my initial reading I found the text to be wordy, indirect and a little overly complicated.  However, after reviewing the test for an essay it became far more easily to take meaningful information from.  Cronon does an excellent job explaining the transition of Indian culture and society.  He also does a very good job of explaining the complex interaction between Indians and European settlers and the American wilderness.  In my opinion Cronon focuses on capitalism and the transitions towards capitialism and Indian society.  Overall a good history read, very applicable to American history 
 One evening later this week Brook Haven Middle School will host its annual Open House. I spent a day in Shari's classroom late last week working hard to clean up the disaster zone in preparation for the occasion.   Shari is the school's drama teacher as well as one of the eighth-grade English teachers. Her drama students are notorious for leaving their thrift store purchased costuming and props in the classroom long after the performances are all complete. I filled four huge cartons to overflowing with those items that we're not likely to need for future productions. They went to the lost and found. A couple of cartons of the "good stuff" went into the prop room.   You would think that an English classroom should have a collection of some decent books in it, but Shari and I sort of go to extremes. Fortunately, I had brought a bunch of paper bags with me. I filled nine of them with old ARCs (advance reader copies) that I no longer cared about owning. A coordinator at juvenile hall will collect them in a couple of days and they'll get a whole new life.   As I collected and neatly stacked the classroom sets of books (SPEAK, THE LAND, THE MISFITS, WITNESS, THE LAST BOOK IN THE UNIVERSE, LEFT FOR DEAD, 19 VARIETIES OF GAZELLE, BRONX MASQUERADE, etc.), and filled those shopping bags for juvenile hall, and filled a shelf in the office with the latest paperback purchases and 2005 ARCs, I also accumulated a very small pile of books to take back home. ("Like coals to Newcastle!" someone knowledgeable of our home might exclaim.) A few were ARCs of books that had gone on to win major awards. A couple were Richie's Picks titles that I wanted to have an extra copy of for booktalks. And I grabbed my copy of MORE THAN WORDS: THE SPEECHES OF MARIO CUOMO, which I used to delve into occasionally for inspiring "patriotic observances."   Two ARCs on that stack for home were literally falling apart. One was Brenda Woods' EMAKO BLUE, which we just bought a new copy of for the classroom. It's been passed nonstop from kid to kid for a year now. The other, which from overuse is now a collection of loose pages nested in a cover, is Alex Flinn's FADE TO BLACK. Finally getting my own chance to read it last night, I had to grip it with two hands so that it wouldn't fall all over the room.   "Night is when I think about dying. That's what I'm doing now, after midnight in the quiet hospital."   It didn't take long to see why Shari's students have been enthusiastically turning each other on to FADE TO BLACK since its arrival in the classroom in January. Central to the story is a hate crime involving a baseball bat and the shattered windows of an occupied automobile. There is a victim, Alex Crusan, a HIV-positive high school student whose family recently moved from Miami to the small town of Pinedale. There is a witness, Daria, a fellow high school student with Down Syndrome. Then there is a football player, also from Pinedale High, Clinton Cole. We learn quickly from Clinton himself that he'd thrown a rock through a window of the Crusan house the night before. Did Clinton also, as Daria tells police, attack Alex's car when Alex was stopped at a red light early on the morning of October 27th?   What Alex Flinn does so well here is to create three realistic and complex teen characters, all of whom have some secrets. She also writes so articulately about the elephant in the room: the continued fear and ignorance in America surrounding HIV and AIDS.   " 'They told us before he came here that you couldn't get sick, just being near him. But I don't believe it for a minute. I mean, what if he cuts himself? He doesn't have those purple, blotchy things you always see on people with AIDS on TV. But still, there's all these molecules and particles and things, junk in the air. And what about dust mites?' I remember once, they told us in science class that dust is all people's skin and junk. Excuse me, but I don't want that guy's skin particles on me."   In an exceptional article, "How a Young Adult Novelist Researches," published in VOYA and accessible online at http://pdfs.voya.com/VO/YA2/VOYA200412AuthorTalk.pdf , Alex discusses a 2003 Minnesota AIDS Project study "in which researchers found that 43 percent of those surveyed did not know or were uncertain about whether HIV could be transmitted through a cough or a sneeze, and 38 percent did not know or were uncertain whether it could be transmitted from a toilet seat." Having done her homework, the author creates a consistent tone throughout the book that is revealing of the myths and the reality and how students are affected by them.   "All the days after, he said hi just hi and I liked him."   Alex Flinn has been steadily gaining a reputation among adolescents for creating high interest, realistic YA fiction that incorporates issues that matter to them. FADE TO BLACK will continue the spread of that reputation. I've got a dismantled ARC as testimony of that.  
 A brilliant readable and scholarly study of the genius of Cervantes's masterpiece. I will enjoy re-reading Don Quixote armed with the insights presented by the authors into the influence of this work upon European literature and upon writers and philosophers in England, France, Russia and Americ 
 We saw this movie at the theater and absolutely loved it!  Tim Allen is so funny in this movie!  I have not seen the original version of this movie, but really enjoyed this film!  There are some great special effects, action scenes that your kids will split up in laughter with!  The character fits Tim Allen very well, he's kind of a scatter brained all business/attorney dad that trys to do the right thing, maybe spreading himself too thin, ultimately overlooking the ever changing needs of his growing children.  With the help of a stray dog, and unfortunate event which causes the dog and dad to reverse rolls, in the end the dog helps him to see his mis-guided ways he's losing his children.  There are some comical scenes of Tim slobbering, scratching, doing really funny dog things, sometimes infront of his court proceedings and clients, yikes!  Likewise, the dog is able to understand and communicate non-verbally with the children and mom to convince them that he is the dad.  The dad's crude behavior jeapardizes his career and the dog is in danger of being kidnapped by a crooked scientist with evil plans for the dog and his special abilities.  It's a funny movie with a great message to parents to be involved in your kids lives.    RECOMMENDED 
 Vladimir Nabokov uses words like an artist uses paint on canvas ... you can see, feel, touch, and sense the stories on many levels. He uses words to control images, emotions, and the level of impact on the reader. "The written word" is his media. His stories provide gripping emotions, startling revelations, depths of experience, creative twists and turns of the plot ... leaving the reader flipping pages as fast as the  mind can grasp the meaning what is read. Whether Nabokov is describing the deep, dark Russian soul or the generous, warm Russian heart, or mundane everyday experiences and scenes - he is a master psychologist who understands human behavior. While his subjects are primarily Russians or Russian emigres, he confines his writing to a unique time in history, about 75 - 80 years ago. Often, the settings are Russia, Germany, or other parts of Europe. The characters come from all walks of life: the aristocracy, the educated, rich landowners, students, ordinairy workers, shopkeepers, writers, and poor peasants. He sometimes contrasts their persona with a deep dark secret or desire.. He seldom leaves a stone unturned when describing the particular path they trod in life. The stories are so engaging and captivating, the characters, plot, settings are so realistic ... this reader wishes some of the stories would never end. You just know there is something yet remaining ... to reveal.  Favorite stories, are "A Matter of Chance", in which a Russian waiter working in the dining car of a German fast train, narrowly misses meeting his wife whom he has not seen in five years. Ironically, she loses her gold wedding ring, later found by a German waiter. The waiter reads the inscription but makes no connection to his co-worker. The Russian waiter unexpectedly gets off at the next stop. Read the story to find out ... the unexpected ending. Another favorite is, "Wingstroke", the most creative and imaginative story in the book. Kern is a young skier who falls in love with a mysterious young woman, Isabel. She is staying on the same floor of his hotel. One night Kern can not sleep, he tosses and turns due to thinking of her. He goes out into the corridor and sees the key in her door. He gingerly opens it and startles Isabel, who lunges toward the window and leaps ... As Kern is pondering this turn of events, in flies something huge, with wings. He wrestles with the creature and stuffs it in the wardrobe. Isabel returns and asks about it, knowing it flew in. Kern tells her where it is and returns to his room.. The next day, Isabel is expected to make a difficult jump. To discover what happened to "the creature", Isabel, and Kern ... you have to read the story. Another most appealing story is, "La Veneziana". The McGores are a wealthy couple who collect art. They acquired a beautiful portrait of a young woman which captured everyone's attention. After the guests play a game of croquet, they come inside to admire the portrait. It dawns on Simpson, a student, who was a friend of the family's son, that the portrait resembles Mr. McGore's wife. Yet, the painter was said to be Sebastiano Luciano, from the fifteenth century. To discover how and why this painting could resemble Mrs. McGore... one needs to read the story.  In summary, the author writes stories with imagination, creativity, substance, depth, unique perspective, and deep emotion. He explores human experiences from many angles. His stories are entertaining, educational, and deeply satisfying to read. Most highly recommended. Erika Borsos (erikab93 
 This scholarly work of legal history comes in a surprising package -- a gripping tale of early Virginia families and early colonial life and the economy.  What a great way to learn about the development of American laws and their foundations!!  It is so well written that I didn't want it to end 
 Christopher Marlowe, the Elizabethan poet and playwright, was one of the most talented members of his generation. He helped pioneer the use of blank verse in dramatic poetry and used it to produce five masterpieces while William Shakespeare--who was only two months younger than Marlowe--was still finding his dramatic footing. Who can say how great he might have become if he were not cut down (possibly on orders of the Queen, herself) at the age of 29.  As a man, Marlowe was the "unShakespeare". Where Shakespeare was a prudent man who invested his money wisely and was careful not to offend authority, Marlowe was a risk-taker both in his personal life and in his plays. In an age where not toeing the official ine was punishable by death, Marlowe never met a line he was not tempted to cross. If this is what got him killed, it also makes him a fascinating person to read about.  David Riggs weaves Marlowe's personal tragedy into an exciting volume that I found as hard to put down as any thriller. It is a book I can heartily recomend 
 Wonderful, feel-good book about family and moral values...Humor and pathos of life properly and wonderfullly mixed...  Though it was written during World War II, it is still a great read, well worth the short time and little effort needed to read and enjoy it...especially meaningful in time of war, rather it be a World War or war in Iraq and Afghanistan...  The world--Ithaca and the United States--was probably never this good, never this pure, but it brings to mind and to heart our highest and finest moments and makes us wish there were more of them.  And there could be, if we would pursue the hightest in man, not the lowest 
 Feldman thought his String Quartet #1 was a masterpiece, that is one with objectively defined proportions, moments, gestures, that all somehow amount and accrete to something that is beyond themselves, itself. I have a problem with the First Quartet in the over-abundance of extended techniques, Am Steg, tremoli, snapped pizzicati, all this materials wears one down if the creator decides to adopt a long durational length. A masterpiece needs to fit the durational frame it adopts.  The 'Second Quartet' however doesn't need such categroical values to place itslef on the globe, in the lifeworld of the aesthetic. It is simply there. The string quartet genre is unlike the piano. My personal conviction is that the piano solo genres offers a purer focused state for all this late music Feldman found a new innovative voice.(i.e. "Triadic Memories", "For Bunita Marcus") The Second Quartet here works quite well because it doesn't drain or irretreivably spend one's listening constitution, it admirably inhabits(haunts at times) the durational frame it adopts.  So then we have a conceptual problem, for how does one experience this work.?Feldman naturally intended it for the concert hall, subverting (so he thinks) that genre. But I would never sit(nor many hardcore new music afficianados) six hours in a concert hall to experience this work.Sorry! Long durational music works on the body as well as the mind,the intellect.Our own life rhythms interface with a work like this. ((And this might be the orientation for some doctorial candidate,to discover how we listen to a work of this length,mind and body))  So again where does this work reside conceptually?, well as a recording seems to be its purest state,somewhat convincing,for we needed interrupt our lives,we can amble about walking between rooms,with hopfully minimal motion; for we are simply speaking about the experience of timbre, there is no description of this work or analysis(although I venture to guess ones will be submitted to doctoral programs). The 'Second Quartet' is an assemblage, materials simply inhabiting a durational space.  Incredible the FLUX Quartet who sustain themselves in this voyage to the timbral stars and galaxies, the timbral/performative concentration was wonderful, the gently plucked strings,high on the string(second or third position) sometimes to get more a percussive un-resonant pluck, beautiful.I could listen to that repeatedly in and of itself. The sustain sound(non-vibrato) as well is difficult for the waverings are immediatly revealing to the ear. The intention here is to listen more,as with a microscope in our ears. So all these performative subtleties will come to the surface now. But there are ugly timbres here as well, suggestive as well from the literature,It's impossible to avoid these cliques music ideas,Stravinsky I'd say(the more haunting obvious moments of the 'Rite') they are always with us. Anton Webern still held a formative influence for the late Feldman here hovers above this voyage and the threadbare,pencil-thin shapes, fragments and moments of beauty is apprarent almost in each moment. But then I'm listening wrong if all these historical musical associations come to the surface of my mind. I just need to listen.You really loose concentration, I found myself idly looking over my library,thumbing through a magazine,sdeeply absorbed in the timbral manifestations goings on. Again the materials here does not overly tax one's listening lifeworld.But again the work does have a narrative at work, even if it is an unintended one. Our internal dramatic "workings" do begin to make associations,For we do need to travel forward with this work.And Feldman does coach it along with again obvious clique-ish at times music materials. We cannot go backwards.Out memory for listening purposes is linear, not para-tactical. There is no point in remembering what we heard. It is like flotsam in the water of a wreck of a clipper ship,or moments from Tarkovski.Move forward onwards.  There is a question of selecting the correct tempi, for which none are indicated. So FLUX intends the work to be played as slow as possible, where a friend informed me the work should in fact be only 5-Hours in length. But I don't know now. Faster would have made the obvious materials even more graphic,needlessly boring and pronounced(within the Feldman aesthetic). A dangerous business playing Feldman.  This is really not a "string quartet" for the four parts has no function anymore, another genre to throw on the scrapheap of history. This is one large string sound we hear, and we really don't care who is playing what, again a Western academic prejudice. So then why did Feldman not write a string "quintet"?, well he wanted to sustain a threadbare beauty,too many strings would suggest something larger, uncontrollable perhaps. Four is enough 
 This book is required reading for anyone wishing to enter the Oriental carpet business. It is also a fabulous reference source for the home buyer 
 Wow. This book was recommended to me by members of a couple of different online reefkeeping forums, and I was not disappointed when I got it. It's an utterly comprehensive book, giving so much information that it's almost an overload. In fact, that's pretty much the only downside. The book reads like a textbook (in fact, if I were taking a college course on captive reefkeeping, I wouldn't be surprised a bit if this were one of the major texts), and that makes it a little cumbersome for the average or casual reader. On the other hand, given the complexity of the hobby and the constant attention reefkeeping requires (there's really no such thing as a "casual" reef aquarist...), maybe the level of detail isn't a bad thing after all.   Excellent pictures, incredible detail in the text, and an all-around great value, even though it was a little expensive as books go (though not nearly as high as some of the other recommended books...). Definitely worth the money, and a valuable reference for all- people just starting out (like me) and people who have been at it a while who are looking to increase the depth of their understanding of the hobby.  
 "I myself am a very normal person. Please do not interpret these stories as representative of the author's personality." This plea to the reader appears on the very last page of this book, and upon coming across it, most readers will probably think the disclaimer belongs at the front of the book. Because by the end of these 16 short graphic stories, which represent a "best of" anthology of Tatsumi's work from 1969 (the plan is to continue releasing a "best of" for each year), it's very hard not to suspect the author of having some major dysfunctions with both society at large, and especially with women. According to the introduction by Adrian Tomine, Tatsumi is considered "the grandfather of Japanese alternative comics", and coined the term "gekiga" to distinguish naturalistic, more adult comics from the popular "manga" fare for kids. The material in this collection certainly falls into the "gekiga" category, as it encompasses very adult material. Not "adult" in the sexual sense (although there is sexual explicit material), but in the more metaphysical sense that is brought on by feelings of urban alienation  The stories are set in late '60s Japan, in what is presumably Tokyo, and Tatsumi writes that he found inspiration in newspaper human interest stories and the police blotter. If that's the case, it seems he was drawn to tragic stories about men who just couldn't cope with their lot. In every story, the protagonist is a kind-faced everyman figure (visually, he is the same in almost every story), who works some kind of menial job either on his own or with men who don't respect him. He either lives alone or at home with a wife or girlfriend who either works as a bar hostess or openly cheats on him. Stripped of his manhood on all fronts, he either lashes out in violence, takes cold-blooded revenge, or commits suicide. Indeed, it's impossible not to notice the misogyny that pervades the stories -- literally every woman is either wanton, scheming, drunk, greedy, or somehow tainted. The urban setting, dominant theme of alienation, outbursts of violence and disgust, and sexual disgust are perhaps best compared to the film "Taxi Driver" in terms of tone, and yet are ones that seem to crop up over and over in modern Japanese fiction and film.   in contrast to the gritty subject matter, the artwork tends to be very clean and crisp, and as with everything published by Drawn & Quarterly, the book is beautifully produced. The panels haven't simply been "flopped" from the original Japanese layout, but have been rearranged for Western formatting, and the results are spectacular. Fans of Adrian Tomine's work will appreciate both the visual style, and the use of silence throughout the stories. However, this is a book that should be read not only by comics aficionados, but by anyone interested in the literature of modern Japan. It will be interesting to see if Tatsumi's stories change tone and theme over time, and I look forward to the 1970 volume. 
 It's always difficult to find a book that isn't cloaked in modern day cinicism, and that's why THE NATIONAL PASTIME is one of the most refreshing books I've read in years.  If you lazily daydream about your little league  days, big league chew, and your first triple, then this will stoke the  fires of nostalgia for you as it did for me.  What i liked most is that I  got the sense that the author is probably not that different from you or  I--just a life-long fan who wants to share his passion for the greatest  game ever played.  The only difference may be the remarkable skill and wit  with which he chronicles our nation's pastime.  He'll make you want to get  a stick ball game gong in the back yard 
 I thoroughly enjoyed reading Triumph Over Fear and have since passed it on to several people in my anxiety disorders support group.  All have agreed that this is one of the best books on the supject because it combines  solid-information, common sense, inspirational patient stories and  practical self-help exercises.  The reader is left with a strong  understanding of the problem and a road map to getting the right kind of  help.  It is often so confusing to figure out which direction to go in and  Jerilyn Ross uses her personal and professional experiences to help sort  out the best way of dealing with specific problems, ie. how to talk to  family members about panic attacks, what to do when one is experiencing  anticipatory anxiety or a setback and how to choose whether therapy or  medication or a combination is best for you.  I found a lot of answers to a  lot of questions and owe a good deal of my own recovery to the information  I gathered from reading this book 
 I first read Otto of the Silver Hand as a child and was completely intrigued by its medieval feel and simple, yet poetic, grandeur.  I can honestly say that it is one reason that I went on to become a medievalist.  As an adult, I've enjoyed it even more.  Pyle's evocative illustrations add  enormously to the mood and beauty of the work.  I strongly recommend it for  people of all ages and particularly as a good book to read aloud to  children 
 my girlfrind love this sandals , they are very good looking , confortable and easy to clean   
 Well-written and geared toward beginners--which made my life a lot easier!  This book was actually far more comprehensive than expected.  Clarity about  how to actually start an eBay business, with great tips and detai.  Also works as a business guide in addition to showing a great understanding of eBay. If you are serious about getting into an eBay business, I would highly recommend this boo

 My 1st grader hates to put it down, he would rather read Magic Tree House books, than play video games. He even reads them to his class and explains the story for show and tell. In his kindergarten class the teacher would also let him read the Magic Tree House books out loud, not to give her a break, but to promote reading out loud. Great books 
 book is fine, good condition, what I expected, but extra packaging not necessary - I received other books in padded envelopes and they are all that is needed, not large boxes and packs of air and popcor 
 It isn't the fact that NOW YOU SEE ME... by Rochelle Krich is her best novel to date that makes it noteworthy, though certainly this would be enough for her fan base, which has been quietly and exponentially growing. What makes this latest installment in Krich's Molly Blume series worthy of comment is that its many strengths render it one of this year's best mystery novels.  It begins with a disappearance that is voluntary but then leads to a death --- which may be accidental, or a murder, or self-defense --- framed against a religious and cultural backdrop that causes an incidental impediment of the investigation. The result is an intriguing, engrossing, and even enchanting tale magnificently and beautifully told.  Blume is an orthodox Jew, a reporter and semi-successful author of true crime books who balances her writing career with her duties as a rabbi's wife. NOW YOU SEE ME... begins with Blume taking notice of an apparent fan who attends three of her book signings consecutively. At first she believes that he's a stalker, but then learns that he needs a favor. Reuben Jastrow informs Blume that his daughter, Hadassah, has run away from home with a man who she met on the Internet. Jastrow is concerned that this incident will ruin not only Hadassah's reputation, but also that of her older sister and their entire family.  Blume agrees. But there are difficulties. Hadassah is 18, and in the eyes of the law is of age to do as she wishes. An even bigger problem, however, is that Blume has not been told the entire truth about Hadassah. The truth indirectly involves an incident in Blume's past, one that makes her hesitant to involve herself in Hadassah's disappearance yet ultimately causes her to interject herself into the matter. There is a built-in time bomb, if you will, that makes the discovery of Hadassah's whereabouts within a few days imperative, one that creates a remarkable tension that by itself makes this book worth reading.  When Hadassah finally reappears, it seems that the matter is settled. Subsequently, however, an apparent suicide victim is tied to Hadassah's disappearance; and when it is discovered that the man is actually a murder victim, Hadassah, her father, her other relatives, and even Blume herself are prime suspects. The ultimate key to the entire mystery is shrouded in the past, in matters almost (but not quite) forgotten by those involved, demonstrating that the errors and omissions of the past generation are often visited upon the present.  There is a subtle but constant interplay between tradition and modernity in NOW YOU SEE ME... Krich does not make judgments here; keeping true to the traditions of Jewish orthodoxy is no doubt difficult, particularly given the temptations inherent in this world. Yet there is a comfort in ritual and belief, and the underlying reasons therefore, that shine through in the Blume novels in general and this one in particular.  Krich also deserves kudos for including an extensive glossary of Hebrew and Yiddish words; while readers can discern the meanings of many terms from context, the glossary at times is a comfort indeed. But it is the story, and the telling, that make NOW YOU SEE ME... a winner. Highly recommended.      --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlau 
 Having read this book (unlike another reviewer), I found it to be convicting to me as a Christian parent as well as inspiring. He gives the 8 reasons that kids rebel and does talk about rebellion but a large part of his focus is on the Christian parent. His 5 chapters on flawed Christianity (Compulsory Christianity, Cliche Christianity, Comfortable Christianity, Cocoon Christianity, and Compromised Christianity) will help each parent evaluate their own Christian life and hopefully spur them to want to live as God would want us to which will in turn inspire our children to do the same. He also gives great helps for reaching out to a rebellious child. I like a quote by Mini Louise Haskin that he ends his chapter on Cocoon Christianity with: "I said to the man at the gate of the year, "Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown." And he replied, "Go into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of God. That shall be to you better than light and safer than the known way." This book is great for all Christian parents, those whose kids are in active rebellion and those who are not. For those parents whose children are not in rebellion currently, this book really gives you insight in how to handle rebellion when children do (which as he states in this book may need to be part of their spiritual pilgrimage) His focus is on raising spiritually strong kids, not spiritually safe kids. I highly recommed this book to all Christian parents 
 This is a wonderful book that portrays the lifelong friendship between two children.  It is so well-written that I found myself getting lost in the characters, their daily adventures, and the town in which they lived.  I  could not wait to read more about them.  It is also easy to lose yourself  in the humorous antics and forget about the pain that lies beneath the  surface of these two characters.  It is a wonderfully written book that  captures friendship, childhood, and the South all in one great story 
 Some think Waiting for Godot is an argument for existentialism. Others believe it is about man's eternal struggle for the answer to the ultimate question. Neither seem correct.  In short, this is a play for those who prefer to strip everything down to the most basic form of language, to strip life down to a mere game of waiting. That is, in essence, what this is all about. We have two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, who both wait for a man who may or may not ever show up. They don't know why. They don't know exactly when he will be there. Still they wait, eternally, by the tree, by wherever they think he said he would show.  This isn't an absurdist play, although it has been labeled as such. Absurdism, though, seems such an insulting way of labeling such a masterpiece. We oftentimes go thorugh our readings with the idea that everything has to be complex, that there has to be a theme placed deep within a convoluted story, but with Waiting for Godot, we have a simple theme: waiting.  The two characters symbolize nothing. They are, quite simply, not waiting to be analyzed. They become, in effect, victims of Samuel Beckett's own game: they are his quotation, and he only says what needed to be said at the time, and so he wrote it, whether people would catch on or not, whether they would label it absurdism or not.  If you were to take every line of this play and utter it aloud, very slowly, word by word like a robot in a very monotone fashion, you would probably capture the idea. If it's any indication, he wrote everything in French first--his second language--and then translated it in to English, just so it can be simple. I don't assume, of course, that this work should be cherished simply because it's an exercise in simplicity. But I submit that it should be cherished because it's a genuine, themeless--somehow--masterpiece about two people waiting for the most unimportant, unknown thing that may or may not ever come. It is frequently hilarious and constantly frivolous, but somehow, it manages to charm. It is like one of those songs that you can listen to over and over again, and it has no lyrics, and no meaning--as far as you know--but it still makes you feel good under glaring adversity 
 If you are going to travel to/across USA Lonely Planet USA is a suitable and practical guide, in spite of its size. The suggestions about hotels, restaurants, sightseeing, sports and routes include both traditional touristic places and alternatives points too. The "author's choices" are great and help you a lot to choose the best options for small budgets. It works as a trustful friend telling you about the best things to do in your next travel. More maps showing cities and roads would be very useful in the next editions.  
 I encourage anyone, everyone to read about these theories and apply them as best as they can to students, their own children, other children they may encounter, if you are stuck in that must-sit-still-and-listen traditional-mindset, you owe it to yourself and others to open up your mind to how kids learn differently. Would love to have this be enforced reading for certain teachers my children and I have encountered in the past 
 I grew up in the Central Valley in California, among the agricultural life described by Mrs. Gates in Blue Willow.  Her descriptions of the heat, the landscape, the people, and the fair are so accurate I feel like I am living  there again as a child.  Her insights into the life of the itinerate farm  worker are so touching and real. I highly recommend this book to anyone who  want to see what life was like in the Central Valley 
 In her essay concerning post-Reconstruction African-American women, Alice Walker seeks to put a human face on what Americans may otherwise only remember as an unfortunate scar on our glorious history.  She asks, "Who were the Saints?  These crazy, loony, pitiful women?"  And in answering herself, she replies in repetition, "our mothers and grandmothers." These are the human faces to which she has attributed all that is contemporary Black America.  "Moving to music not yet written," Walker's image of the former female slave is one, not necessarily of a battered laborer, nor of a heifer being kept only because of her ability to breed valuable livestock, but rather as an artist ahead of her time. These women made beauty while amidst horrible conditions. These women were not merely ex-slaves, but they were "Poets, Novelists, Essayists, and Short-Story Writers" whose potential was never met, and dreams were never realized.  For this reason, Walker attempts to embolden and even mobilize African-American women with the responsibility of realizing the potential of black creativity denied their ancestors.  Walker asks, "Do you have a genius of a great-great-grandmother who died under some ignorant and depraved white overseers lash?"  What an amazing question to ask.  How many geniuses and artists were slain by the horror of slavery?  Americans spend a lot of time and energy thinking about the economic, political, and social restrictions slavery imposed on African Americans, but I have never even heard elusions to the loss of black creativity due to slavery.  I too have given more thought to the socioeconomic inequality within black America than I've ever given to the stifling of their creative ability. Perhaps, we should give this idea more thought, for it was the efforts of these "poets" in everyday life that transported black women to where they are today, and have arguably elevated the intellect, creativity, and soul of an entire nation.  Thought provoking; this is an essential read for anyone interested in understanding the effects of slavery, especially those effects that go beyond our typical understanding of oppression 
 I loved this book as a child and now read it to all the children I take care of in the daycare where I work.  I have children from two to four years old begging for it every time they see me, never tiring of the story.  Even when one thinks the amount of text might bore them, there are many children who are simply transfixed by St. George and the Dragon and patiently listen to the story over and over again.  It is a good introduction to classical literature as well, and the allegory and traditional hero story both are stimulating to developing minds.  The main illustrations as well as the page borders are vibrant and imaginative.  There is no unneccessary or tasteless violence and I continue to find copies of this book for children I know 
 I think Al Green is the best soul artist ever. I love all his music and he has a voice that is out of this world. I think the artist we have today can not compare with this man.

 When will Elfman get his due credit? The man is one of the most versitile composers of his day, and has not been awarded a thing. Personally I think that Nightmare before Christmas was his best. But Corpse Bride was fantastic. He know how to fit into Burton's visions perfectly 
   Philip K. Dick deals with the question what is human and what defines humanity by comparing humans with humanoid robots.   In the course of the novel Rick Deckard, a bounty-hunter, whose job it is to kill humanoid robots, androids, that escaped from Mars starts to cast doubt on his assignments. Are androids really unable to feel empathy? They sometimes seem to be even more human than humans. But who is human and who is not? Is the test created to find out about the real nature of the protagonists really infallible?   And what about Rachel Rosen? On the one hand she occurs to be very cold and rational, but on the other hand she acts very emotional.   The novel makes everbody think about life, its meening and its value in a different and new way.  
  Each chapter in this book illustrates some aspect of modern timber engineering. The early chapters introduce the reader to the basic properties of wood. From then on, the reader is treated to subjects such as the depredations of termites, wood construction and fire safety, the value and limitations of mechanical connectors, the use of timber trusses, the earthquake resistance of wooden structures, and the value of shop drawings in construction.  The branch-trunk junctions of living trees are an example of moment-resistant joints (Chapter 2, page 13 therein). A good tutorial on the flexure of a beam is provided in Chapter 5 (pp. 15-16 therein). A simple model, consisting of sheets of paper, illustrates how the layers of the beam variously go into compression, tension, and/or shear.  There is a chapter (Chapter 7) on traditional joinery, written by Ben Brungraber. The main focus is on mortise-tenon joinery. Chapter 15 discusses covered timber bridges, notably the Town lattice trusses. There is also information about a video on the construction of a modern Town-lattice-truss covered bridge. I have seen this video, and found it quite fascinating.  This is not an engineering book. There are only a few sections that are quantitative, and the mathematics used is straightforward and well-described. 
 I am so glad we took a chance and ordered this cat litter box.  It is much easier and, to me, more sanitary than the traditional litter box.  My favorite part is not having to touch the scoop (most of the time, there is an occasional clump that needs to be helped out) and being able to pull out the drawer and dump the contents in less than a minute!  The only gripe I have is that when you roll the box over there does tend to be some litter that leaks out even when all the latches are firmly in place.  Overall, a very good product 
 This was a great little book to use as an intro to sock knitting.   This book has several different weights of yarns used to make socks, so even tho a small book, it gives alot of options.   If I were only to purchase one book on socks, this would be one I'd consider, there's enough variety to keep you busy for awhile. 
 Due to popular demand, this book is now back in print and available again. Enjoy 
 How could you possibly not like this CD?!  Being an old parrothead and a someone who got off the LA freeway without getting caught this is the perfect blend for me.  Bottom line, get me out of the city....if I cant be on a tropical island, give me the range.  Give me a cheeseburger or a steak in paradise.  Way to go George, Alan and Jimmy 
 Edward G. Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, and James Cagney...the holy trinity of gangsters in American film, and with White Heat (1949), we see not only one of Cagney's best gangster films, but also one of his best films period (in my humble opinion).  Directed by Raoul Walsh (High Sierra, They Died with Their Boots On, The Naked and the Dead), the film stars James Cagney (The Public Enemy, Angels with Dirty Faces, Yankee Doodle Dandy) as Arthur 'Cody' Jarrett a sadistic, unbalanced criminal mastermind who quickly becomes public enemy number one, with a bullet.  Also appearing is Virginia Mayo (The Princess and the Pirate, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty), Edmond O'Brien (The Killers, D.O.A.), Margaret Wycherly (Sergeant York), Steve Cochran (The Kid from Brooklyn, I Mobster), Fred Clark (The Lemon Drop Kid, Auntie Mame), and John Archer (King of the Zombies, Bowery at Midnight), father of actress Anne Archer.  The film, taking place mostly in California, begins with a group of armed men, led by Cody Jarrett, holding up a train (I thought robbing trains went out with spats and buggy whips) and holing up in an isolated cabin in the deep woods, I'm guessing somewhere in the High Sierra region (there's a whole lot of heat when you kill a few people and run off with $300,000 of the gooberment's money).  It's here we get to meet everyone proper including Cody's mother, who shall hence be known only as `Ma' (Wycherly), Cody's wife Verna (Mayo), Big Ed (Cochran), and a handful of others.  Using an approaching storm as cover, Cody and the gang split for Los Angeles, leaving behind a vital clue that allows the Treasury Department, including investigator Philip Evans (Archer) to get a line on the crooks.  Rather than get pinched, Cody cops to a lesser crime in another state, earning him a two-year stretch in a state penitentiary as opposed to a trip the gas chamber.  Not willing to let Cody get off so lightly, Evans brings in an undercover specialist Hank Fallon (O'Brien) to pose as fellow inmate Vic Pardo, the idea being he'll cozy up to Cody and get the goods, but that's no easy task as Cody trusts no one except his mother, and for good reason as with Cody temporarily out of the picture, Big Ed assumes control of the gang, along with pitching woo at Verna.  Eventually Hank/Vic does get chummy with Cody and circumstances lead up to the men escaping, as Cody returns to not only settle some old debts, but to regain control of his gang and resume his criminal ways resulting in a huge score at a chemical plant, all leading up to one of the most memorable finales in film history.  As far as gangster films, they really don't get much better than White Heat.  Everything works here for me including the immaculate performances, extremely well developed characterizations, dialog that snaps, interesting and engaging characters, stylish and tight direction, excellent production values, and an incredibly intricate storyline with lots of twists, both big and small, to keep the viewer drawn in throughout the nearly two hour running time.  As far as the performances, Cagney's obviously the main attraction here, but I've always thought when a film contains a versatile powerhouse like him, the other performers tend to step up as if to say `Hey, I'm in a film with James Cagney...I'd better give it my best', not that those supporting Cagney here were slouches, but no doubt they found a certain amount of inspiration appearing with him as he seemed to demand a lot of himself, and understood the medium (what would work and what wouldn't) better than most at the time.  Cody is about as tough and vindictive a customer as you'll ever come across, along with being extremely smart, knowing most all the angles and always planning three steps ahead (the instances where he and his gang get fingered are usually the result of a mistake by another, not Cody himself).  I thought both Margaret Wycherly and Virginia Mayo did very well, the former as Cody's mother who, at times, seems a little too close to her son, and the latter, as Cody's conniving and untrustworthy wife who goes whichever way the wind's blowing (the life of a gun moll sure isn't all it's cracked up to be).  The threesome provides an interesting dynamic as Cody's closeness with his mother obviously rubs his wife the wrong way, but she's smart enough to know not to get between a sadistic, criminal psychotic and his mother knowing if push came to shove, Cody would side with his mother over his wife in a heartbeat.  I also thought both O'Brien and Cochran also did very well, the former ingratiating himself into Cody's good graces (which was no easy task), and the latter an oily, opportunistic two-bit thug grabbing what he can and hoping to cement his usurped position through murderous betrayal.  Two of the most memorable scenes for me (not counting the end) involved Cody dealing with another prison inmate named Parker, recruited by Big Ed to ensure Cody never made it to the end of his sentence.  In one scene, right after Cody narrowly escapes an attempt on his life, he lays it on the line for the Parker (who's a real weasel by the way), basically telling him how he's going to get him, but not before letting him sweat it out a bit (which he does, if that look on his face is any indication).  In another scene, after Cody escapes from prison (with Parker in tow), Parker's locked in a trunk complaining about the lack of air, to which Cody accommodates him accordingly.  As I said earlier, the dialog really snaps, and here are a couple of great examples...  This first bit occurs between Verna and Ma, as the men return to the cabin after robbing the train and Verna drags herself out of bed well after the sun's come up...  Ma: Well if it ain't the sleeping beauty. Verna: What else does a girl do around this bear trap? Ma: There's plenty you can do without wearing out the mattress.  This second bit happens as Cody grabs up Parker during the prison escape...  Parker: You wouldn't kill me in cold blood, would you? Cody: Nah, I'll let you warm up a little.  You can read these bits here, but to get the full effect they must be heard as they're delivered, with all their glorious inflection.    The picture, presented in full screen (1.33:1), looks very sharp on this Warner Brothers DVD release, and the audio, in Dolby Digital mono, comes through cleanly.  There are a variety of extras including a re-creation of the movie going experience back in the day when theaters would show a theatrical trailer (in this case it's 1949's The Fountainhead), a newsreel, a comedy short (the one here titled `So You Think You're Not Guilty' featuring a character named Joe McDokes as played by George O'Hanlon), a cartoon titled `Homeless Hare', all introduced by Leonard Maltin.  Also included is an audio commentary track by film historian Dr. Drew Casper, an original theatrical trailer for the film, a new featurette titled White Heat: Top of the World (16:51), and subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.  Cookieman108  By the way, if you're interested in picking this movie up, I'd suggest locating The Warner Gangsters DVD Collection as not only is this film included, but also the features The Public Enemy (1931), Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), The Petrified Forest (1936), and The Roaring Twenties (1939), as it might be a better value than buying the films separately. 
 Ok, so actually, I'd give this book 4.5 stars, but dang it you can't do half stars, so I rounded UP!    Butcher deserves so much praise for this book!  It was great! From vampires, fairy kings bent on destruction, necromancers, also bent on destruction, and a long dead tryanasous rex roaming Chicago, this book has something for everyone. And as Butters would say, and does, Polka will never die 
 The first ever fire emblem game I played was "fire emblem" for GBA. I was instantly hooked. if you have ever played a fire emblem game, I believe you will like this game. If you haven't, you will if you like RPG and Strategy games. The story of the game is well writen and is very interesting as well as the gameplay. some of the levels may make you want to throw your system out the window but you can get past them if you try. I beleve this to be the best fire emblem game yet. 
 I agree with the comments made that the language in the book is sometimes difficult to follow. If you want clearer instructions on the use of words in a therapeutic context, I recommend The Secret Language of Hypnotherapy by John Smale. Undoubtedly Erickson was the father of modern hypnotherapy but his works need to be placed into an updated world and given a new perspective 
 I almost didn't finish this book. I was about twenty pages into the story when I came to a vulgar description of the way Liv (the main character) is proposed to by her boyfriend (who later becomes her husband and then ex-husband.) There are a few moments like this which had me squirming (and I'm not a prude, honest!), but overall, I was thoroughly entertained by this story and the writing.  Liv Kellerman has just left her husband and, more importantly, her beloved, lavish New York City apartment. Since she has no training or experience (other than at being a wife and decorating a home) she must now attempt to find a place to live and a job. Liv finds the best apartment she can afford - a tiny hovel with the shower in the kitchen and appliances which do not work. Next she scours the want ads for jobs she feels she qualifies for - and which she thinks she'd enjoy. One thing she enjoys is reading and so she thinks being a reader for a blind judge is the ideal position.  Because the judge is blind, Liv does things like make faces, steal office supplies and unbutton/re-button her blouse in front of him. Soon she feels bored and unfulfilled and after bumping into a mysteriously gendered stranger - Dale - she embarks on a career as a real estate agent.  And during this leap into a new career, Liv falls for Andrew - a bizarre and possibly unavailable architect with a penchant for ear-biting.  The writing is good and Liv is an enigma. She's mouthy, she's selfish, she's got a twisted sense of humor. There were sections that had me snorting out loud.  Through all - the jobs, the apartments, the sexual-harassment from her various bosses, the ear-nibbling boyfriend - Liv does become stronger and more independent, though the change happens slowly and it's not until the end when she tells her ex-husband what she really wants out of the divorce where we see she's finally taken a stand for something that's important to her.  I enjoyed the story - it's Chick "Grit" - not as cutsey and tame as many other stories depicting single-women-in-the-big-city 
 Forget it. You aren't going to convince me. I am well known for completing an awful lot of stuff fairly quickly but I still always have much to learn about time management and organization. Lee Silber's Time Management for the Creative Person is a treasure trove of little tricks, hints and exercises to get you on the organized straight and narrow. Stop denying you have a problem and go look through your closets. Or ask your best friend. They will tell you. Seriously, from the badly rattled to the mildy behind schedule this book helps all kinds of creative people to become inspired to set goals from themselves in an organized and timely fashion, and with Silber's usual sense of humor and fun. A quote used in the book:   "A lot of frustrated artists are people who didn't take the opportunity when it was presented." - Jimmy Buffett. Don't miss out on the opportunity of this book

 I recently purchased this book based on the rave reviews even with an updated second edition off the press. I can honestly say that this book is Awesome in detail and explanation and is still extremely relevant to understanding the how too's and processes involved in routing tcp/ip. The most amazing feature about this book is how well explained and the book makes topics that would normally seem dificult or confusing easily understood, in other words grandma could learn how routing tcp/ip works from reading this book!

 Jeffrey Krames' book allows you to gulp in quickly the easy to apply and often powerful bite-size success strategies of Jack Welch. This book is the perfect buy for any manager who wants a condensed version of the Welch Way, with an opportunity to apply the lessons learned on a personal level. Great job 
 Reading Sterne's basics on WWW Marketing you realize that most home page makers are not yet mastering the art. Too many home pages still resemble the image of a death notice in the Sunday paper. You study the new ones every week, cut one out when a dear one was implicated, though you just file it somewhere dusty.  In every case you never return to read the text again.  Studying the black-framed ads of other nationalities, religions, sexes only reveals intercultural differences. Nothing more.    But the Web is not for the dead ones, it's alive and a course for the process of lifelong learning and improvement.  Jim Sterne shows you the path to follow - Read his manual 
 This is a Dan Brown book but has a feel of a James Patterson book.  It is a typical scandal in politics and as it unravels it is even more scandalous.  I thought it was enjoyable and had some interesting information about space and the ocean that will give you some educational value.  I enjoyed it a lot but wouldn't classify it as a best ever 
 Absolutely Outstanding.  5+ stars.  Wonderful, intricate thesis.  Superb character development.  Educational in today's complex War on Terror, Islam and Al Qaeda.  Terrific literary style:  Clear, concise, tight plot, quick reading, engrossing. I've missed the "Old" Frederick Forsyth of "The Day of the Jackal", and "The Odessa File.  He was a genius.  Well "The Afghan" is Forsyth redux.  It is a wonderful in depth story not only of the War on Terror but how that War evolved.  He plumbs the murky depths of the Al Qaeda world and how today's terrorists came about.  Why are they so willing to commit suicide in the name of Islam?  Forsyth examines the intricacies of the Al Qaeda network and how it can put together such complex terrorist plots.  He does make some very minor technical errors but in such a wide literary effort that is to be expected.  The true strength of Mr. Forsyth's novel is his in depth character development.  He gets to the "gut" of why these men are who they are and why they do what they do.  No gratuitous violence, but some explicit scenes to emphasize the depravity of today's terrorists.   Mr. Forsyth is a master of plot development.  As demonstrated in his earlier novels, he both educates and entertains as he weaves a very plausible story.  I sometimes wish he would not be so illuminating in trade craft as it gives the "bad guys" unnecessary information.  I am happy to see the old Forsyth back and look forward to his next novel. Must read recommendation 
 By his untimely death at 29 Christopher Marlowe had written this and other plays (including The Jew of Malta) which inspired a beginning William Shakespeare to sharpen his craft.  As regards this play, Marlowe was sort of the Pete Best of the era doing his version of the Hey Joe of the era.  To continue musical metaphors he didn't invent but merely sampled the Faustus tale and in so doing gave it his own unique spin.  Though the version we have was not recorded until about a decade after Marlowe's death (and therefore shows signs of later adulterations by other writers) you can still observe the genuis of Marlowe at work.  By likening his character to the Greek methological story of Dedalus, Marlowe imparts that sense of doom so connected with the potential arrogance of human ambition.  As a reminder, Dedalus was affixed wings with wax by his father Icarus only to lose them and fall when Dedalus flew too high and had them melted by the light of the sun.  Similarly Faustus is -- in almost Christmas Carol type fashion -- visited by the personified seven deadly sins and Lucifer himself...itself then a unique device uniquely and effectively executed.  Throughout Marlowe makes us witness to Faustus' growing sense of doom at the irrevocability of his contract with Lucifer.  Sadly, to the modern reader much of the horror of his Faustian bargain is lost to us.  For the most part, we moderns don't have the immediate fear of Lucifer that our forebears had.  For us today, evil does not lurk in the shadows but is rather all too much before us as we proceed through our days and take note of current events.  Still the same the play was a landmark piece and an inspiration to Shakespeare who had before him an example of the genuis he had to compete with and the standard he had to maintain.  
 This is a fundamental book for everyone who is in a committed relationship with Christ and who wants to deepen their communion with Christ on a daily or hourly basis.  It is an essential book for anyone's personal library 
 Good movie.  Rather racy in light of the rating.  I thought it probably would have been an X.  Interesting plot and I especially liked the ending 
 this is such an awesome series...easy to read, but fun, too! Has some cool recipes, chicken piccata is the BEST 
 A collection of useful information for users - new and old - of Microsoft Windows Mobile Smartphones.  The format makes the book very easy to either read or to use as a reference, with lots of pictures, tips, and notes.  The book is well organized, and full of real-world examples and advice.  It covers both the included basics, and additional software and accessories.  As someone who develops and supports Smartphone software, I know how much a book like this is needed by the Smartphone community 
 A great storyline leads to many action packed scenes in this movie.  Jason Statham is very believable as an action movie star.  Excellent fight scenes that look very authentic.  Sure there are some cheezy moments here but all the great action makes up for that.  
 wow! i have a few of the range of costes tunes so i didnt think that this would be anything special! but how wrong could i be! get out and get it 
 Huge S.U.Vs, hormonal-pregnant women, teen-age sons and rock music...nothing is safe from Dave Barry's sarcastic wit and humor.  Dave asserts that all the cool rock bands were the Rolling Stones and the Beach boys and the stuff his son listens to is garbage (he also asserts that his son listens to bands with names such as "Heave" and "Squatting Turnips").  This just goes to show you that Dave is old, but he doesn't mind making fun of the fact that he's old.  Dave appeals to the government, insisting that we declare war on Canada for reasons that escape me at the moment.  Oh, and by the way, I wouldn't drink that Luwak coffee if I were you 
 I am the leader of a parachurch organization on a university that works with three different student groups - one that is predominately Caucasian, one that is Asian American and another that is African American.  Law's book gave a lot of words and definition to what has been our experience in working through multi-ethnicity and the beginnings of racial reconciliation.  Especially helpful has been the explanation of perceived power and how that effects dynamics within a multi-ethnic setting.  I was also glad to see a chapter on how power redistribution can happen on a practical level (chapter 7).  I have read a number of books on Biblical multi-ethnicity and this has been one of the most helpful.  ("Divided by Faith" is the second best. 
 Outstanding historical book with deep insight into both the immediate and extended Roosevelt family.  McCullough make reading and learning history easy and enjoyable.    
 This book changed my life when it first came out... I brought my toys to the office and started taking regular juggling breaks.  Using some of the strategies in the book, I transformed myself and my team.  Now, years later, I've found myself rediscovering the book, and sharing it with my new team -- although I'd incorporated many of the strategies into my work and home life, I'm re-applying some of the forgotten messages and strategies.  This book is nothing short of life-changing.  I also love the illustrations!  The ONLY negative I have about the book is that I think the original larger format was a better package -- that edition had a very fun color road map / chapter listing on the inside covers that added a great deal to the look and feel of the book.  (I was happy to find that the content had remained the same.)  I recommend this book to team leaders as well as team members.  DO THE EXERCISES 
 This is the second book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  It really kept me reading.  I learned more about Frodo and Same and their quest to destroy the ring.  While reading this book I could easily imagine the events.  If you enjoyed the first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, you should read this book.  There wasn't any part of the book I didn't like. 
 Letting Go is an insightful companion for an emotionally intense moment of parenting. If you're also looking for loving ways to celebrate a graduation and send a young adult into the world with the counsel of the people important to him or her (YOU!), I recommmend "Words to Live By: A Journal of Wisdom for Someone You Love" by Emily and Kate Marshall, a mother-daughter team 
 This is an intelligent, thoughtful, beautifully written story that is so compelling I found it hard to leave. It is one of the most spiritual books I have ever read. I had no idea how much I would be drawn into the ruminations of a Catholic priest about his faith (I am not Catholic). But it is a really suspenseful, and even funny book. It's like nothing I have ever read before 
 Writing while the gap between rich and poor widens, and from Southern California, recently identified by researchers from Wayne State U. as the nation's most economically segregated region, I was naturally drawn to the new biography of one of the last politicians to show serious concern over the way wealth is distributed in the U.S.  This is the abridged version of The Huey Long Story, less exhaustive than T. Harry Williams' bio but almost certainly more readable.    Huey was a politician the likes of which we'll probably not see again.  He traveled widely throughout his state pressing the flesh and remembering names.  He delivered on promises to build roads, hospitals, and schools; to provide free textbooks and make LSU a first-class institution; to challenge Standard Oil and other major economic interests in order to bring some dignity to impoverished people.  For all that he was equally loved and reviled.  Can anybody outside of Cuba or Venezuela imagine listening -- sometimes on a hot, humid afternoon -- to a politician speak for three hours?  We nowadays give that kind of attention only to rock, sports and film stars, but Huey Long commanded it in the '20s & '30s.  As a U.S. Senator, Huey Long tried to take his Share Our Wealth program to a national level, rivaling FDR's New Deal.  His jealousy of Roosevelt and his own presidential aspirations led him to obstruct the passage of some of the more progressive parts of the National Recovery Act, a strategy that worked against his own state's interests.  With the understanding that desperate times cause people to put their faith in crooks who would exploit their fears, Roosevelt regarded Huey as a demagogue.  Ultimately, Huey's sharp dealings and alienation of opponents led to his assassination.  In this bio we don't see much of what Huey said; we're told numerous times that he was mesmerizing.  We get quotes that are cartoonish:  "I never read a line of Marx or Henry George or any of them economists.  It's all in the law of God."  But LSU history professor Richard White has given a straightforward, albeit somewhat repetitious, measure of Huey P. Long 
 In 1996, George Michael released his long, long-awaited third album entitled, OLDER. This album is more different than that of his first two albums, where this album features a great deal of songs composed in a mature mixture of Jazz and R&B. In some ways, the album did not do well, but in my opinion, the album should have because it shows that George has enough talent to reinvent his sound. His image had also been reinvented, where he went with a shorter hairstyle that was a dark brunette, instead of a dirty blonde.. He left behind his five o'clock shadow and went with a matching hair color goatee.   JESUS TO A CHILD  The first single from the album. Definitely one of the most moving ballads George has ever recorded. Everytime I hear this song, my heart is touched from this heartfelt ballad that features George singing in his most soothing and relaxing sound ever.   FASTLOVE  The second single from the album. I really dug this song the first time I heard it and I still love it today. The video is nothing short of amazing and words cannot describe it.   OLDER  The fourth single from the album, as well as the album's title track. This song is quite impressive, but it is not quite I had expected. But all in all, it is still a great song.   SPINNING THE WHEEL  The third single from the album. I was not expecting too much out of this song, but I was wrong. This song is definitely amazing in every way. This is a song that I will continue to play over and over again.   IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER  Not a bad song.   THE STRANGEST THING  Whenever I put this album on, this is the first song I listen to. It sounds very strange, I mean, very, very strange, but it is very catchy and I was immediately hooked when I heard the first minute of it.   TO BE FORGIVEN  Not bad.   MOVE ON  Not bad.   STAR PEOPLE  "Star People 97": The fifth single from the album. Both the album version and the single version are outstanding.   YOU HAVE BEEN LOVED  The sixth & final single from the album. Not quite what I had expected, but not all that bad.   This is an album that is classified as another amazing album. It is definitely one of my favorites and will always be a favorite. I know a lot of you do not have this album, so get out and buy a copy for yourselves 
 There are 4 main reasons I really like this book - the patterns, the fiber knowledge, the knitting skills, and the friendliness. The patterns are ones a normal, non-model person would actually wear. The instructions are well presented and cover a wide range of knitting skill levels. The fiber knowledge for non-wool knitting is awesome. I live in Florida so I need to convert wool patterns to fibers I can wear for more than a month a year. There are helpful little tidbits of knitting skills sprinkled throughout the book that guide and encourage. And finally, the friendliness. Reading this book is like talking to an old friend that shares my passion (and obsession) for knitting. This book is a welcome addition to my library 
 Kreutz has compiled a superb collection of problems and their corrections. Many of which can carry over to watercolour, acrylic, pastels etc. On the back cover is a list of topics which is very useful when you become familiar with the book. I find myself looking at the painting, not quite sure where the fix is, work my way down the list mentally assessing which corrections might work. If you like art in the style of Rembrandt, Caravaggio, and Chardin then you'll find plenty in here of interest. I read of a complaint about the photos not being in focus. For the most part I would say they are in focus - look at the signature and how crisp it is. Kreutz might be painting in a looser style than what some folks are used to. There are 2 or 3 pictures which could be considered out of focus but they get the subject matter across. 100% Recommended and well worth the money 
 Everyone should own this product. I receieved my item on the day I was told it would arrive, and it looked exactly like the picture 
 Alan Furst's Night Soldiers, takes us first to 1934 Bulgaria, where 19-year-old Khristo Stoianev witnesses his younger brother being beaten to death by local fascists simply for being a smart-aleck. As a result, Khristo allows himself to be recruited to go to Moscow and train with the NKVD, the Soviet spy service.   Though intelligent and thoughtful, Khristo has almost no real power over his own life. Instead, he is buffeted through the conflicts of his time, serving the Soviet cause in the Spanish Civil War, struggling to find love and dignity in pre-war Paris, and surrendering to the inevitability of fighting the Germans as part of the French Resistance. Finally taking a gamble on the meaning of friendship and his past, he journeys through the heart of eastern Europe to help an old friend and perhaps regain his own humanity.   Night Soldiers is episodic in plot, with each episode in Khristo's life only loosely linked to that which came before. Through no fault of his own, Khristo seldom drives the events of the story, and is instead often the victim of the unseen forces of history. The book's central weakness is that the many people who touch Khristo's life are not nearly as well defined as they should be, robbing the story of some of the emotional impact that it could have had.   Yet Night Soldiers is a superior book. I'm not familiar enough with the period to know whether Furst made any historical boo-boos, but I doubt it. I felt deeply immersed in the real history and geography in each of the many different settings of the novel; I feel that if I traveled the Danube on a tugboat, I would see the shining mountains, river flotsam, and fishing villages at each turn of the river just as Khristo sees them on his final epic journey.   More importantly, Night Soldiers is deeply satisfying as a human drama. The exciting thriller aspects are certainly present, but they're secondary to the re-creation of one man's life emeshed in the great historical forces of the 20th century. Khristo seems real, one small human who finally stops trying to tell the good guys from the bad guys and simply puts it all on the line to be a decent human being. 
 Frank Miller, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (Dark Horse, 1995)  Dwight is a photographer, mostly doing subcontracts for a nasty little private detective. It's not much of a life, but it's something, and it's something better than he had before. Which begs the question: what happens if before intrudes on Dwight's new life?  Such is the premise of A Dame to Kill For, the second Sin City graphic novel (and the only one of the first few not to be featured in the Robert Rodriguez movie. Don't worry, berks, there's a sequel on the way). As you expect if you've read ten random panels of Frank Miller's work before, what happens is that things go very awry very quickly, and, of course, they get violent.  Perhaps the most interesting thing about the novels (reflected nicely in the movie) is how far in advance Miller was obviously setting things up for later episodes in the series. Single panels from other books appear from other perspectives in different books, giving the reader a stronger sense of time than he'd otherwise have (the rest of the clues are a bit more subtle, such as Marv showing up towards the end of this book with the bandages on his face that he gets early in the first book). Miller's world is full and richly detailed, his characters dark and complex, and his art bordering on the expressionist while retaining the minimal quality of good noir. Lovely, as usual 
 One of the most brilliantly numbskull heavy rock records ever to emerge from the 80's this debut album from Skid Row is a powerful mix of throwaway cliched sentiments and biting  blasts of bile. This is a late 80's hair metal band but one you should buy into - as opposed to corporate dross like Tangier or Danger Danger. The reason? Actual fire in the belly. Actual grunt under the bonnet - a serious big block of pounding and reckless self belief.  Going into specifics is beside the point. This is an album that should  be taken in it's entirety and as such it represents a hell of a party. Motormouth frontman Bach is in fine fettle, his infectious personality and blazing set of pipes cutting a swathe through the solid rawk rock provided by the guys.  Some critics did point out that much of this product was fairly, well, full of hot air. And that's tru to a certain extent. But compare this to stuff like Ratt, another dependable act of the time, or Warrant even? In relation to Ratt, this disc has huge 'X' factor that commands attention with it's great hooks and personality. Regarding the latter named hair band, well the full bodied attack and the full on assault and the psychologically haunting aspects of this album like the lyrics to 18 and Life means that posers like Warrant are blown away. This album scored five stars in Metal hammer upon it's release by then editor Chris Welch, who was nobodies fool.  My honest advice is that while this is not a flawless record it is a fine, fine hard rock record with weight and delicious sneer. So pick it up - heck it's cheap enough so why not take the plunge 
 When first released this was a breath of fresh air. It's an excellent album with intimations of the eventual deconstructionist SELF-PORTRAIT which was to follow.  Yes, indeed. I have a copy of the original vinyl album here at home scratchy though it is; and yes, it's true that the four Beatles ARE up at the very top edge of tree upside down at the middle of the picture, less than a 1/4" high 
 Part memoir, part social history, part guidebook, this work by Pete Hamill is a must read for anyone who loves to wander around Manhattan taking in the sights and sounds of the city. Hamill perfectly captures the sensations that make NY the world's greatest city.  In addition to sharing his obvious love of the place he uses historical epsiodes that occurred in the various neighborhoods to both inform and entertain.  As a transplanted NYer who visits as often as I can I completely related to the feelings evoked by this book. I'm never quite as happy as I am wandering around the streets of NY and reading Hamill's book made me realize it's time to jump on that plane and get back home for a visit.  Great Book. 
 How can you put Mariah and Madonna against each other???  They have 2 different types of music and 2 different types of vocals, pinheads!  I love Madonna just as equal to Mariah too, but you don't see me pinning two divas against each other.  Some of you all need some serious therapy and stop drinking on that hatarade.  I loved the greatest hits LP!  It had all my favorite songs on there it and it's still a total joy to listen too. 
 This book disserves itself by purporting to be merely about scenario planning, although it covers that subject thoroughly. In fact, it's one of the most lucid, interesting examinations of fortune and folly you will ever read. The recapitulation of disastrous episodes at a handful of once-great companies shows just how little inclined the gods are to spare the proud. Closed minds and entrenched habits of thought managed to afflict even such a venturesome New Economy firm as Yahoo! Originality and experimentation bless even companies in humdrum industries, such as packaging. Captivating anecdotes and illustrations are, in fact, the meat of the book. The scenario planning analysis, while solid, is less convincing than the cases themselves. At times, the book shows the weaknesses that are probably inevitable when so many authors share creation. It tends to meander and, now and then, loses its way in jargon-choked thickets. But, we assure you, the clarity of the cases redeems it and makes it valuable 
 Taylor successfully tackles a sprawling, detailed subject -- seventy years of byzantine European diplomacy that set the stage for the First World War and, not so indirectly, the Second. He doesn't hold the reader's hand, and assumes you are familiar with many of the events and people he discusses. I wasn't, so I referred often to Britannica, Encarta, and Wikipedia as I read. By doing so, I learned a lot from this book 
 The album is the mix Acid House and a modern day minimalist style music.  They were always ahead of their time 
 The other reviewers are right...but, the best tune on this set is "Power" a collaboration of friends making great music. I had the original lp and now am getting the cd... I just love the harmonies here... don't miss this 
 My copy of this book is 51 years old and has my grandmother's autograph.  Talk about a lasting gift!  I love books as gifts, and this is my all-time favorite 
 Not being a television observer of cooking shows or even one who keeps up with 'celebrity chefs', JAMIE'S KITCHEN came as a fresh surprise as a book that just happens to have excellent, reproducible recipes for some fine dishes!  Jamie Oliver deserves his fame, if this book is any indication.   Young and spunky, with a real talent for witty explanations that keep a recipe book palatable (!), Oliver offers not only some well-chosen delicious treats not found in other cookbooks, outlined in the most easy to read and follow fashion, but he also pays attention to other details.  Like marketing, for example.  In a very short space wholly free of pretension, Oliver supplies tips on how to buy foods, when to buy them, when to tell if the produce is the best (and tips on keeping the grocer informed as to the occasional lapse in quality control!), informing the reader that fresh fish should never smell fishy and should have clear eyes , smooth scales etc.  Little bits of info like this make the reader bond with the chef, ready to accept his advice on preparing apparently simple yet unique and elegant fare.  There are so many cookbooks out on the shelves these days, but few match the quality of photography of the chef at work, the dishes prepared, the lightness of the written words, and the honest and informed commentary that this book does.  Makes you want to read his other books - like getting to know a new friend better!  Grady Harp, July 0 
 I have found only 2 books that I could read time and time again. This book is a wonderful story. Not my normal fare, but a surprise. When I first picked this book up I had no idea what I was in for. It picks you up and will not put you down. About once every two years I find myself re-reading this book, and each time I enjoy it so.  If you are going on vacation and would like a good time, this book is a wonderful investment of your time and money. 
 I was very young when this aired, so I was never able to watch it in full. So, you can imagine how ecstatic I was when I later found one of the VHS in my local Blockbuster. The Disney version had been a long-time favorite of mine, and I was certain that this would live up to my high expectations. Which, of course, it did with flying colors and then some.   Why has this not made it to DVD yet? It boggles the mind that such a spectacular and insightful series can be beaten out by trash like these "reality shows" (how many seasons has "Survivor" and its offspring had by now?) and overblown prime-time soap operas ("Desperate Housewives," etc come to mind...) in box set availability? Are we, who don't need flagrant sex, violence and backstabbing to enjoy a program, such a minority? What a frightening thought.. 
 As a kid, I had to learn the Koran at school, whole sections by heart for exams. Never liked it! Compared to the bible, I found it wanting. However parts, the poetry still rings in my mind.  So when I read this book, it dealt with things that I thought I had already learnt.   I was shocked. Some of the information, I have never seen before for example the lack of evidence for Muhammad outside the Koran, a person I thought was the most documented man in medieval history was a real stunner. I went on to the net, to check his sources. Much seems correct.   On the other hand, the writer is negative about Islam yesterday and today. In fact he is negative towards religion in general. Some is over the top. For example, Islam is not a totalitarian religion. Also Islam has at times been tolerant. Religious Muslims in many western countries have been successful.  On the other hand Islam is certainly not a religion of peace. Much of the criticism is justified for example the refusal by senior Islamic figures today to criticize the crimes committed in Islam name today.  If Catholics, Protestants, Jews or Hindus had committed 911, we would have seen a never-ending steam of guilt statements coming out of these religions. What do we see in Islamic world? A stream of conspiracy theories the Pentagon, the US government, Israel did it.  
 Beautifully written erotic short stories exploring a range of sexual and sensual indulgences, some explicit and some sublime 
 Great 'kick-around' shoe!  To the store, to the bank, to the PTA meeting............cute, convenient, COMFORTABLE shoe 
 The handbook gives the true foundation for the supply of quality products or services. It focuses on the design of the product and it's need to perform correctly in the customer's use environment.  The thing I really like is the inclusion of case studies. The addition of actual applications enhances the understanding of the theory presented in the first part of the book. The case studies are also good thought starters for your applications. 
 The track "Kissin You" is tight as hell!  Puff Daddy remade this  song; it was the "Oh Honey" remix.  I have searched for a long  time to find this song.  I mean did he just stop publishing it?  We need to  get this one back 
 A great study bible. The inclusion of the rare Deutorocanonical/Apocryphal Books makes this a unique and complete document 
 This is a very good program for either the beginner or an experinced family historian. With a easy to use interface and designed to make things simple for the user to add family members to the family tree this program is a joy to use 
 Mike-the vocalist for these guys made his name with early Dropkick Murphys stuff. Don't buy this expecting a patently Irish-American sound. It is more straight-up than the Murphys and still damn good. Following up on their first albumn, Savin' Hill, these songs take you through the lives of Bostonians and frames them in the context of todays politics and pressure. Nothing tricky or loaded though-the songs are honest, up front and articulate punk ballads. 
 The key insight I had when I read this book is that the behavior of organizations when they become "addictive" follows very predictable patterns.  There is nothing unique about them.  But to a society that is full of "addicts" who create addictive organizations, the principles revealed in this book will stir reactions and opposition.  The book is almost too honest, and there lies its power.  The book has many new insights and connections and is a lot of fun to read.  I found myself chuckling often 
 The images are great!  And the book is a great addition to my library 
 After retiring at age 70 as a journalist, Stone took up a new avocation, learning ancient Greek in order to study the originals.  His topic was the origins of democracy, and in part, how icons like Plato and Socrates have falsely been given credit for fostering these ideals.  In this well reasoned book, Stone presents the case against Socrates - not to argue that his death was justified, but rather to show that he was convicted for the political reason that he supported an anti-democratic oligarchy:  "The paradox and shame in the trial of Socrates is that a city famous for free speech prosecuted a philosopher guilty of no other crime than exercising it.  To invoke the memory  of our own American lapses, Athens had no Alien and Sedition Laws, Athens had no little Iron Curtain like the McCarran-Walter immigration  act to bar visitors with suspect ideas.... Athens was un-Athenian, frightened by the three political earthquakes when the democracy was overthrown in 411 and 404 BC and then threatened again in 401.  These events help to explain the prosecution of Socrates, but they do not justify it. 
 Buy and read a copy to you grandchildren; They will remember the experience  forever.  I actually reference back to this book when I do studies on philosophy and religion.  There is much more here than meets the eye, and the stories have survived for millenia.  
 The authors have performed a tremendous public service with this autopsy of 9/11. I detected no bias. They did a great job correctly weighing systemic failures to individual failures. Certain individuals merit condemnation - but the failure of our society (which is all of us, after all) was much greater.   Oddly, the book left me with the feeling that it cannot happen again. Mohammed Atta was running around with a blinking red light over his head screaming, "I am CRAZY! I am CRAZY!" Imagine someone on a mission that big risking it all to fight a woman over a seat cushion WHILE ALOFT during a flying lesson! Or leaving a stolen plane on a runway at Miami's airport! It seems impossible that we could miss those multiple warning signs in the future. If we do, we deserve what we get 
 I got a copy from my university library and really enjoyed the step-by-step diagrams and flow charts. It was easy to follow and a great place to start if you are writing a scope of project document, or a specification document. However, I found all the grammatical errors a little alarming, and it put all the great work into a bad light. I am amazed that Wiley allowed this edition to ship, or possibly, my library has an advanced copy that wasn't completely ready. Otherwise it is a good basic book on branding 
 Don't get this book if you want to feel comfortable about your Christian life!  Dr. Evans makes you think, and examine yourself daily.  But such in-course corrections are needed if we want to finish well 
 Reservation Blues, which won the American Book Award in 1995, is a touching look at modern life on the Spokane Indian Reservation.  When legendary blues guitarist Robert Johnson shows up on the rez with his enchanted guitar and a dark secret, Thomas Builds-the-Fire begins a journey of self-discovery and painful realization that will forever change him and his friends.  After the magical guitar ends up in his hands, Thomas forms Coyote Springs, a band made up of two seemingly unmotivated drunks Victor and Junior, and two Flathead Indian sisters, Checkers and Chess.  The book chronicles the bands' humble beginnings playing at the local bar on the rez to a hopeful encounter with record executives in New York City.  It is within this context that Alexie is able to confront serious issues facing the Indian community today with his own subtle sense of humor. The straight forward plot is layered with metaphorical connections to a general Indian past, while each character is forced to confront haunting personal issues.  For Thomas, it is the embarrassment of his alcoholic itinerant father.  For Victor, it is the sexual abuse he faced at the hand of the reservation priest.  For Checkers and Chess, it is a feeling of loneliness, the search for a "good Indian man," and being seen as outcasts on a reservation not their own.  Ironically, their music is the only thing which gives them a feeling of power and inner strength, yet it is the opportunities provided by this music that alienate them from their own people.   Alexie believes the problems facing Indians today are the same faced by their ancestors 100 years ago.  An obvious example is the names of the record executives for "Cavalry Records,"  Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Wright, and Mr. Armstrong; a direct link to the Generals who murdered their ancestors.  Signing away your freedom in exchange for an empty promise is an idea which transcends the generations for Indians; the record contract and the peace treaty.  Another problem Alexie confronts is the relationship between half-breeds and full-bloods.  In his own original and comical way, Alexie uses a pick-up game of basketball which pits Thomas' father and the rez drunk, Leonard,  against the half-breed Tribal police force.  Insults fly, and the comedy that ensues is unforgettable.   Reservation Blues was a delight to read.  Alexie is a talented writer whose gift for storytelling is enhanced by his social commentary and his humorous presentation.  Few writers would be able to tackle such subject matter without the work falling into the category of a tragedy.  Alexie's grasp of his people's sense of humor is unparalleled, and the jokes transcend racial and social lines.  His ability to remain light-hearted when discussing suicide, alcohol, and rape is an impressive feat.  It is not a surprise that he feels it is this very philosophy that gives Indians the ability to move forward and succeed.  Focusing on the positive, while making light of the negative is a quality Alexie attributes to the survival of his culture.  Overall, it is a story of accepting one's past in order to move forward.  It is a story of hope, of survival, and of reality.  Reservation Blues is more than a fictional work, it is a searing look at the political, social, and religious issues facing Indians today.   
 Book II of Card's Alvin Maker fantasy alternative history of frontier America covers some of the same ground as in Book I, Seventh Son, but now through different eyes. Rather than the mostly idyllic and rational vision of the white man's world-that-was-or-might-be, centered on Alvin's family, this story mostly gives us the Red man's view of white oppression versus working to live together. White's forest clearance vs. Red's forest custodianship is the most powerfully expressed metaphor of the contrast, while the black, Unmaker, rivers run through. Certain central events in Alvin's numinous awakening to his powers in the first novel are now seen from an unsuspected "other" side, not that of the Devil as the intolerant Rev. Thrower would have it, but from the native Shaw-Nee or Kicky-Poo side of the rivers. This book includes a version of Tippecanoe, the massacre that made William Harrison our President, that chills the blood. Card has an especially different take on liberty-loving Lafayette, an associate here of Napoleon rather than dead Washington! Really, these amazing shifts in view on American political icons are one of the great appeals of this series.   The other appeal, of course, is that Card is an imaginative teller of tales. He infuses this tale with a mythic, sometimes elegiac and mystical, quality, despite dialogue cast in backwoods provincial patois. Card is imagining a more hopeful frontier experience, among Hoosier "hill-billys," where the green hope of the Reds and their Napoleon is crushed finally. The story has become fiercer, bleaker and more desperate. It can be hard going because attention is not always on the central character, but digresses into sweeping quasi-historical tangents that only eventually feed back in to the "main story"--if that really is Alvin. I suspect the more you know of frontier history in the old Northwest Territory (after the East Coast Revolution and before the Cowboy Frontier of the West), the more fun these stories will be. That adds a level of detection to the interest of the story. The similarity here to Card's totally brilliant ENDERS GAME is the coming of age of another boy, who also struggles with "swarms" and powers whose strength is only slowly revealed. 
 I liked this book better then I liked the season on DVD.  It is a cute comi 
 I purchased this book to prepare for the ACT.  It familiarizes you with exactly what you need for the test.  It's excellent for long-term preparation, but you can even use it in a crunch.  I flipped through some of the pages the night before I took the ACT and had never opened up the book before, read through some things, and I ended up getting a perfect composite score of 36. You don't need any resource other than this one in preparing for the ACT.  
 I loved this book as a preschool teacher, and now, as a kindergarten and first grade teacher I have come to appreciate it all the more.  It has been an invaluable aid in teaching my first graders to look for patterns in books.  They love to sing along with the pages and it is filled with patterns...repeating and growing patterns.  Of course, I teach math, so I have a certain bias... 
 this book has some very different designs and the instructions are clear and precise - i fully recommend buying it! 
 The description says that the events of "The Dead" took place on New Year's Eve.  They did not: the most likely date for the events (I'll spare you all the reasons and details) is the evening of January 6th, also know as "the Feast of the Epiphany. 
 Listen to it where you can here all the sounds, not in your car. Ive been with Dylan since since 1964, and this one is a masterpiece of music perfection. Did not get it much at first, but after a few listens on a good piece of equipment, my computer, not in the car, I heard so much more.  This album is one of his very best, all the songs are excellent and memorable. Buy it, enjoy it, like a great glass of wine, and relax as you listen. Definately the grammy winner 
 I can easily read the display 7-8 feet away in dim light.   The base unit receives its signal from the remote that I placed on the north side of the house on a shaded porch. In between are 4 walls since the two units are located diagonally across my house. Absolutely no problems with reception.  I purchased an additional remote (THR138). When I place the base and two remotes side by side at room temperature and let them stabilize for about 15 minutes, all three agree within 0.3 degrees Farenheit.  Read the manual! Add batteries to the remote(s) first, press the reset button(s) with something non-conductive (a toothpick), and THEN add batteries to the base unit.  I live in a cold climate. While I haven't experienced sub-zero temps since purchasing this unit, my other Oregon Scientific wireless thermometer, an RAR232, has worked just fine with alkaline batteries at -16F this season.  Excellent value 
 I read this play and later saw it, too, performed at the local high school.  The script itself is a brilliant work, but if you really want the full experience it is a must-see show.  The music is heart-rending and inspiring, and the lyrics are creative and meaningful.  I find the story, if a bit twisted, to be very truthful to our modern society, and it gives insight to our natural discriminatory ways.  The Bat Boy has to face the hatred of the townsfolk and struggle to get them to see him for who he really is.  This simple theme is packed with twists and turns galore, plenty of suspense, and loads of laughs.  Every time a song or a scene gets pulled to a tense or teary climax, there will be a line, or even a subtle word, that provides comic relief.  The script alone is wonderful to read, but I recommend you buy the CD with it, because the music is so incredible.  Overall, a thrilling play 
 Without a doubt this is one of Mel Brooks' greatest films.  Taking nothing away from Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein, this film offers some of the most uninhibited expression of the language of the time.  Never was there a time where you could be so raunchy without having an "x" rating slapped on your film.  This is a must see and a must have for any serious comedy fan 
 Frightening!  There's no better word to describe what happened to Wen Ho Lee.  Clearly, this is a case of racial profiling, but the Chinese--and Asian--community can now relax.  The new enemies are Middle-Easterners, with hundreds now imprisoned in Guantanamo. And, one day we'll be reading yet another book by the Moslem prison chaplain who has just recently been arrested and held incommunicado for---who knows what?  Under our present system of "justice," what happened to Wen Ho could happen to anyone.  If you don't believe it, read this book.  It's truly an eye opener 
 can i know more detail about what is the artificial intellegence thank a lot 
  This "Madcap Adventure" is a real adventure. 2 Kids find a box with wooden monsters in it and one of the monsters get water splashed on them. That's where the adventure starts! JUST ADD WATER 
 I am not Chinese, however these are wonderful folk tales and present morals and metaphors that transcend culture.  I highly recommend this for reading a loud to your children, especially young girls 
 I love it! Finally a cd where all of the songs are good 
 This is an incredible piece of work!  It is one of the top 5 BEST and most impacting books that I've ever read (and I've read a lot).  There are so many thoughts and principles that have stuck with me.  This isn't a book you read where you come away wondering what you learned because you can't articulate what you read and/or learned.  With this book, there are amazing teachings. It is much better than so many other books on business, leadership, and life balance.  As an family man, MBA and non-profit student director, his book and my application of its principles have truly left a great impact on my life and in turn the lives of others 
 Mr. Katz writes for the rest of us as most others write for only those who are experts already. This book is beautifully illustrated (with photos by the author), and is very easy to read and understand.  Katz knows what he's talking about as he is a professional carpenter who has been through the tough jobs and tells us how to figure out projects and make the job easier by using the right products and tools 
 You will not be sorry! And BE SURE to buy Claudine Hellmuth's first book as well, Collage Discovery Workshop; Make Your Own Collage...!! These books are truly THE BEST "Discovery" I have made in years. This is not your typical "how to" book. The layout is user friendly for sure. And the techniques are simple and easy to follow, but you will find they also serve as a springboard for exploration and experimentation. The author somehow manages to encourage and inspire while giving you direction that leaves plenty of room for you to find your own style of collage. And all the while, you feel as if you are sitting down with an old friend. I think this is quite a tall order and quite an accomplishment. Don't hesitate to buy Claudine Hellmuth's books now 
 Dr. Clark succeeds in tapping into the frustration many Christians have with those who seem to that the faith in "obvious", the belief is simple.  In fact, doubt is essential to faith and causes us a crisis which inevitably forces us to come face to face with who we are and what reality itself entails.  Dr. Clark takes onthe challenge of appealing to doubters, but also lending them hope and a reason to continue to believe.  His helpful, though cursory, study of Kierkegaard has opened my eyes to this philosopher and wants me to read more.  And an author that can make one want to read more has succeeded greatly.  This is a must-read for all Christians 
 Until I heard Tony Joe White on a blues channel, I never knew he existed.  I immediately ordered a CD and have almost worn it out. He is amazing. 
 The Trial Of Davy Crockett is a speculative fiction novella. Author Fletcher Rhoden questions whether Davy Crockett was truly killed during the battle for the Alamo - or whether he was captured and executed by the Mexicans. The Trial Of Davy Crockett presents a hypothetical dialogue between Crockett and Generalissimo Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, which collide in an articulate, wry, thought-provoking, and no-holds-barred verbal conflict regarding the Texian Revolution and America's unrestrained expansionism. Neither Crockett or Santa Anna is stereotyped in the roles of hero or villain; their opposing points of view are given a clear and fair hearing, for all to see and judge for themselves. Based entirely on the facts of the revolution, The Trial Of Davy Crockett is a "must" for Texas history buffs and not to be missed 
 I really liked this story. I think some of the strengths are all of the penguins and how curious they are.  It also tells some penguin facts. I think the story was very engaging.  It kept me interested through the whole story because it was funny.  I think this is a book for all ages.  Anyone who likes penguins. I really hope you decide to read this book. By: Tiff Meid 
 As a small child i used to beg my mother to rent out puff the magic dragon every week from the video shop just down the road from me. to see that children of today can still share the magic of puff is wonderful. the video is just as the old one and the messages that it gives out are like none of the modern childrens videos. i reccomend this video to anyone and everyone. fantastic 
 I thought this book was very good for classroom teachers who want clear information on how to include English Language Learners in their classrooms.  It is very difficult to explain to classroom teachers how to include students who are learning English in short sound bites.  This book helps clarify information and teachers can read it at their leisure.   I personally don't like the term English Language Learners because it denies the fact that the students have their own languages and those languages shouldn't be ignored.  In fact, using the student's native language helps students learn English.  
 The Bilingualism Reader is the only existing reader in the field, a comprehensive collection of the classic articles in the study of bilingualism. Designed to be used as an essential introductory text for students, the reader covers all the key areas in the field. The introduction includes a perceptive discussion of the dimensions of bilingualism by the editor and an article on the description of bilingualism by Mackey. Part one, Sociolinguistic dimensions of bilingualism, is further subdivided into two sections, language choice(with classic articles on diglossia and language choice by Ferguson and Fishman), and bilingual interaction (with articles on code-switching by Blom & Gumperz, Myers-Scotton, Auer, and Wei, Milroy & Ching).  Part two, Linguistic dimensions of bilingualism, includes two sections, grammar of code-switching (with articles by Poplack, Clyne, and Myers-Scotton & Jake), and language acquisition of bilingual children (articles by Genesee and Meisel). Part three, Psycholinguistic dimensions of bilingualism,includes articles on the bilingual brain (Obler, Zatorre, Galloway & Vaid,and Paradis), and studies of bilingual speech processing (articles by Green, De Bot, and Grosjean). In the conclusion section the editor discusses methodological questions in the study of bilingualism. The book is wonderfully edited, whereby the reader is guided through different sections all of which contain notes for students and instructors, including study questions and study activities. This outstanding collection of the key articles in the field, accompanied by a critical discussion of today's issues in bilingualism, a comprehensive glossary and an up-to-date resource list, is an essential guide for incoming students and a wonderful resource for bilingualism scholars.

 Cancer phobia, some people say, is worse than cancer. Well, not really... But true up to a point. Being afraid of a disease, be it cancer, AIDS, or whatever else, can be debilitating. And who of us doesn't know people that are scared to death of cancer, or of AIDS? And how can we all not be scared (maybe even terrified) of these diseases, when in our eyes they're not just diseases but are loaded with a whole lot of different meanings, mainly linked to death...  Susan Sontag's essay on cancer (& her later essay on AIDS) deal with these diseases as metaphors of whatever is bad, evil, reprehensible, sinful about human experience. Especially with cancer, the metaphor is more poignant, since, cancer still has unknown causes, at least up to a point: of course cancer now is much better understood, but in '78, when Sontag wrote the first essay, cancer was mostly unknown territory. Obviously, when we're talking about unknown territory, unknown (& mysterious) causes, there's a lot of theoretizing & projecting: anyone can project their own ideas on this white wall of ignorance. And so people 'fight' cancer, 'win the battle' against cancer, 'have cancer personalities', 'cause' their cancer or whatever else. It was even worse with AIDS, especially in the '80s: then it was widely (& stupidely) believed that this new disease was the payback for the free sexuality of the '70s, & especially of the sexuality of homosexuals.   Susan Sontag's essays tackle these issues & show the metaphors & prejudices of illness as what they are. They are important, clearly-written essays, & if today some of these ideas appear obvious or widely known, remember that Sontag talked about these things many years ago, being one of the first people to address the issue 
 Seen under the most objective perspective, this was a transient album. With this premise in the analysis, this second album finds a band that still has not developed a personal style. Faster than the speed of life, the opening track is a prelude, a thundering theme that works out as stimulating vehicle to put us in mood. Don' ts step on the grass, Sam is a Country song with visible influence of the blues. Obviously the resonant voice of John Kay was an additional instrument in the band.   Ironically, Magic carpet ride has been the most commercial piece for the great audiences: it possesses originality and highly expressive character; the organ is the basic support instrument  and that was by itself a very remarkable idea. I must insist in an aspect many times forgotten: in those ages you had to engage the exigent auduiences through the rhthym: The Video Clip was an inexistent term, and to get the total acknowldedge of so many people with such golden bands in action for that moment, was a  task nothing easy to reach.  Somehow the excessive popularity gotten by the band with this single, obligated them to rethink their original target and purpose: Magic Carpet ride was in the opposite side of the street respect to Born to be wild their everlasting hymn.  If you are a hard fan of Steppenwolf or simply a minutely searcher or collector of the greatest bands of the bands, this album is fundamental for you, because it's an important piece in the wide gamut of musical forms that came derivating from pioneer bands such as Vanilla Fudge, Deep Purple or the Doors for instance, both bands were supported by the organ too, so it is easy to foolow the traces of the first experiences with the Moog Synthetizer, that would reach a sum peak with Yes and Emerson Lake and Palmer.  Go for this record because even Steppenwolf has not acquired their definitive musical personality, you can realize some changes are going on, and so make the link with Monster (their most solid and mature album), just before to initiate their gradual decay with later albums.   This is an album that delineates his raising profile, I mean the epic journey.                   
 Let's put it this way...I lent this book to my friend and I am eager to get it back to read it again.  Furthermore, I can't wait to read the sequel.  I understand that the author is serving in Iraq currently.  Keep your head down buddy...keep safe as we are looking forward to more great work.   Readers, forget the whining about the grammar.  I'm a stickler for grammar, but if you really look at this book as a survivor's journal, it adds a sense of realism 
 These are most sane little cookbooks! Ingredients you have, or will use again, so you don't mind adding them to your fridge. Clear and easy to follow and results are uniformly excellent 
 Finally a book that provides basic pictures of ALL parts of the body for a toddler.  Very Simple and easy to follow and gives the necessary pictures to help kids learn about their bodies, especially the "private areas" 
 This is the only book that has ever touched me.  It took me 3 days to read and that is only becasue I tried to slow down to make the enjoyment last longer.  Elsewhere is what I would like to imagine it would be like (but for me there would be a stronger presence on God).  there are several parts in this book that touched me, like the talk with her brother and seeing her dog again. What a wonderful read.  I will remember this book for years to come. Do not think this book is just for young adults.  I am older and this was such a great book 
 The anecdotes of old time baseball are worth the price off the book alone. Vincent's tales of meeting with Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio are priceless. The splitting of chapters into topics and lists were fun. Each chapter offered something new, a virtual learning experience. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it  to any real baseball fan. It shed a new light on his commissionership in my opinion and, in the true test of writing, actually changed my mind about Pete Rose and his inclusion into the Hall of Fame. I always thought Pete should be admitted, but after reading Vincent's words, I have changed my mind 
 This book contains wisdom, which is a rare quality.  It may not be what some people call "accessible," but learning to access it will improve you.  I've been holding a dialogue with the oracle since the late '70s; my understanding has grown in that time, but it may be that I have more to learn yet.  This particular translation to me shows the signs of subtle genius, never mind that it's Chinese to German to English -- Wilhelm and Baynes knew what they were doing.  If you're going to get a copy of the oracle, get this one.  If you get a different one, still get this one, so you can compare them.  I regard this translation as authoritative 
 If you like to read about different kinds of homes and what lives in them, you would like this book. It is about a cactus that lives for 150 years! In that time about 38 animals make holes and move in. After 150 years it falls over and 10 to 20 more animals move in. This is a great book 
 You know the feeling when you find a great LP you've never heard before and you play it over and over again? Well this is what happened to me when I bought Crosswinds, got it on vinyl which makes it even better and like most people the stand out track for me is "Heather" (8 and  mins of magic 
 I was very disappointed in the last Oregon book. This was a fun read and the character development that makes a Cussler book worth reading. 
 I bought this book for my daughter who is a great cook. Upon returning home from a trip to Italy recently, she remarked to me that she wished she knew what kind of wine to order with her dinner. Now she knows.  I have lost count at how many times she has thanked me for the book and told me how much she is enjoying it. 
 First of all, thanks to all who have taken the time to read my book, and to those who have taken the time to write a review.  When I wrote the book it was my intention to inform potential sitters of the pros and cons of pet sitting - many people think that it is, well, 'a walk in the park'.  Well, many times it is - and sometimes it isn't.  It was definitely not my intention to stop anyone's dream from becoming a reality...but I do believe it is better to know if something is right for you or not before your whole HEART is put into it.  I am glad to read the words "humor", "wit", "laughter", "amusing" and "smile" in the reviews.  I wrote the book in a candid way for SITTERS as well as ALL PET OWNERS....even though our furry & feathery friends lift our spirits each and every day, putting more LAUGHTER in our lives doesn't hurt.  After reading the 'reality' of pet sitting, should you decide to continue your pursuit of pet sitting - or decide to perhaps choose working with animals in a different profession - I am glad I could help steer you in the right direction, and wish you all the best!  To all pet lovers who purchase my book in the future, thank you in advance 
 I have rated this book four stars, not because I feel that it is well above average but not spectacular, as that would normally indicate, but because I do not feel qualified to rate it and wish to have as little effect on its average rating as possible. I am a reasonably intelligent, reasonably well-educated individual with a good facility for numbers. Still, this book was well over my head. If you're planning a career in Mathematics or Physics, this book is probably necessary to your education, but unless you're truly brilliant, don't be surprised if you need qualified instruction to understand it. But if you're simply an intelligent, curious individual with a desire to comprehend Einstein's theories, don't be surprised if you can't make hash of this book 
 This soundtrack is a wonderful way of celebrating the movie "Romeo and Juliet."  The soundtrack was wonderful and I highly suggest if you like classical and vocal music, that you should buy this CD.  I didn't like the movie pieces in the soundtrack.  When you listen to the songs there are a few interuptions of the actors and actresses speaking during the song.  All in all I really enjoy it 
 This album has got to be Coltranes'(or any other saxophonist) boldest work ever. The sheer power behind this album is mind boggling. Jupiter was by far the hardest one to listen to. It took five years before I could actually sit there listen to the whole album. When I first go the album I was a new commer to Jazz. I had some of Coltranes work, but only his early work like Blue trane, and Giants Steps. But I took a huge step too far foward when I got this album. I got thru 5 minutes of it. After that I was afraid to listen to the album. To this day I still can't understand the whole thing. While I believe that this album is a milestone in music, I would not recommend this album to anyone. Only to those adventurous enough to have their minds challenged and stretched and at times pummeled in ways that is beyond all human comprehension. This not for begenners 
 I have read this fascinating book and cannot do better than to offer this review which appeared on January 4th 2005 in The Times Literary Supplement:  'Michael Haag's dazzling new book, Alexandria: City of memory, has two aims, both admirably achieved: to construct a political and social history covering a half century or so - roughly 1915 to 1960 - within the larger period of what he calls "the heyday of cosmopolitan Alexandria"; and to display the resulting version of this cosmopolitan Alexandria to us through the lives and works of some of those who have left written or verbal records. ...  'The written record used by Haag includes Cavafy, of course, as well as E. M. Forster and Lawrence Durrell, all three of whom not only wrote extensively about their Alexandrian experience, but also participated in significant social networks. It might be supposed that this ground has been adequately covered by the multitude of specialized studies that already exist on the individual authors, or by Jane Lagoudis Pinchin's excellent literary study Alexandria Still: Forster, Durrell, and Cavafy (1977). However, much of Haag's material, even when he deals with such major figures, is new, has never been published before, and is thus anecdotal in the original sense of the word. ...  'Haag is at his most brilliant when he deals with Lawrence Durrell, on whom he is now perhaps the world's leading expert. Durrell's reputation rests almost entirely on the Alexandria Quartet (1962), which arose from his experience in Alexandria during the Second World War. Neither of the two full-length biographies of him, however, is in any way adequate to this subject. On one level, Haag's treatment of Alexandria itself during the war provides a parallel to that of Cairo by Artemis Cooper in her splendid Cairo in the War (1989); on another, it answers several questions specifically raised by the Quartet and explains what lay behind its genesis better than anyone else has yet done. The personality of Eve Cohen, the first of Durrell's two beautiful Alexandrian Jewish wives and the obvious inspiration for Justine, is crucial here; and Haag not only interviewed her extensively, but travelled with her back to Alexandria to revisit the sites that figured in her life during the War.' 
 When I was a kid, anytime our local theatre company would put on musicals, my Mom would always buy me the soundtrack prior to the show so I could know the songs.  This is easily one of my favorites.  There are a few songs on it that everybody knows like, "We're in the Money," and "Lullaby of Broadway."  Others are hardly known at all like "I'm Young and Healthy," which I sang in my first grade talent show.  But I really get a kick out of the dialog about Allentown, spoken by Wanda Riechert and Jerry  Orbach prior to "Lullaby of Broadway.&quot 
 Having read "Surely you're joking, Mr Feynmann", I had wondered about his relationship with his first wife, because she was hardly mentioned.   This book sets that right, with some fascinating and personal letters. In particular, the letter he wrote a year after her death hit me very hard, and I don't consider myself sentimental.  And that's just the first part of the book...if you like Feynmann, this is a must have 
 A novice on the guitar, I struggled with the concepts of understanding the organization of chords.  I take lessons but the concepts using a numbering system were not sinking in.  The first 10 pages of fretboard Logic were worth the price of the series.  Bill Edward's style fits my learning needs and I can easily relate.  I haven't gone beyond page 15,yet, because I want to apply what I think I now know. The DVD was helpful in further clarifying at a slow tempo what was spelled out in the book. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because I have so much more to do and I want to reserve final judgment until later.     
 The characters are so interesting and plot is so suspenseful that you could get lost in this book and drown in it. My book club read it, and we discussed it for a long time. Although many of us wanted a happier ending, we agreed that it had the right ending.   There is a lot of death in this book. Now, in the age of antibiotics and Tamiflu, death is not so near, and that makes this book seem almost like a horror novel in places, when once character after another dies. But this takes place in 1919, so it's right.   Minn 
 A truly forgotten classic, the best recording by either Johnny Winter and Rick Derringer, no small claim since they both did excellent work on their own and with others. Together here for the first time, their combination of sizzling blues guitar and rock and roll chops meshed perfectly. Winter's leads and especially his slide playing throughout this recording are top notch, and Derringer's interplay with him is inspired as well.  The songs are strong, with Derringer contributing four excellent tunes including his "rock and roll hoochie coo", which he would record on his own and score a big hit just a few years later. I prefer the version on this album. "on the limb" is a fine rocker with slick slide work from Winter and alternating lead vocals from Derringer and Winter.  Winter's compositions are great also, especially "prodigal son" which has one of the greatest guitar solos I've ever heard. Johnny's vocals are soulful and strong throughout the album, his singing on "nothing left" is especially emotive.  The covers chosen here are fantastic, including a killer version of one of my favorite songs, "no time to live" from Traffic's 2nd LP. "let the music play" by Allan Nicholls and Otis Stephens is a standout track also.  Derringer's brother Randy contributes one song, "am I here?" which has a fresh approach and arrangement which contributes to the variety of the recording.  This band would record a great live LP and then split up, but for this short time they were among the best, and this is one of the finest LP's released in 1970. I have not heard any CD version of this, as I am still listening to my original vinyl which is smoking hot. If you appreciate late sixties British blues ala Clapton,Page,Green,Simmonds,Alvin Lee,etc. and Hendrix,ZZ Top,Allman Bros.,Skynnyrd, you will certainly love this. 
 I really enjoyed this book.  Prior to reading this book, I had never read a history book.  This book has given me a hunger for more history.  I was amazed at my ignorance of America's involvement with the Philippines.  And I was surprised at the hardships that the Filipino people have had to go through. The author was a writer for Time magazine, and this book was written very well.  I found it educational and very interesting 
 it is a reprint of the first edition 1883 version.  The book itself is one of the best American prose works ever, especially the first 80 pages, Whitman's transcribed bloody napkin notes as a nurse in the Civil War and lounging around D.C.  It then turns into what he was going to call "notes of a half paralytic," and it is a strange way to read Whitman, less body, less movement, detailing nature like a thoreau journal, but unlike hdt, he travels west, and his lecture in Kansas, where he talks about the language of england not being able to describe this landscape and the form of poetry not working for it are among his most thoughtful and interesting ideas.  I like the cover and the basic physical sense of this book, too, though it is just a cheap dover 
 In his introduction to the Penguin paperback of Hot Water, Robert McCrum notes that little-known books like this one are every bit the equal of the better-known Wodehouse fare. Maybe not every bit the equal, but certainly rather close. So why four stars? I can't give every PGW book five stars, although if PGW doesn't deserve five stars, who does? My first take is that this novel is even more convoluted than the typical Wodehouse offering, and the plot, such as it is, as McCrum points out, would be impossible to describe.  So I won't try. Suffice to say that although you don't find Jeeves on holiday at St. Rocque, or Stiffy Bingham rendering the Chateau Blissac (which has burglars the way other houses have mice) unfit for man or beast, you do find a cast of hitherto unknown personnel engaging in similarly mischievous, conniving, and ultimately good-hearted antics, leading through the most unlikely turnings to one of those trademarked Wodehousian happy endings. In fact, the very absence of Drones, Crumpets, and the Oldest Member (and their assorted musings) make this 1932 French farce read like a stage play. Add a few songs and you've got a Guy Bolton-type musical. Even moreso than A Damsel in Distress, which hit the silver screen starring Gracie Allen (Burns), Hot Water is ready for the big time.   This is one of the many nearly-unknown PGW novels being brought into print in Overlook Press' new line of PGW hardbacks. That will delight those PGW collectors who want library quality editions (and sell to libraries). I, however, find these new Penguin paperbacks to be just the thing to stash in the pocket or the backpack, the literary equivelant of tea time, so as always to have this light refreshment close at hand. David Hitch's illustrations seem to me to strike just the right note, and I hope Penguin brings us the entire line of Wodehouse in these editions 
 This "old-fashioned" novel by Jane Lindskold moves briskly from one scene and theme to another, but with rich detail. Its lead character, Jenny Benet, is an EDUCATED American wild west woman. She adventures with mostly Victorian British, yet key players are a British Muslim convert and a "quiet" Egyptian native. The scenes and themes are mostly Egyptian native, however. But there are other settings and players, including wild west American, Victorian Britain, imperial German, Italian and Egyptian Coptic. So the scenes, themes and players flow in a rich, balanced diversity, with direct and subtle contrasts. [...]  The plot twists and turns, with mysteries and puzzles along the way. I enjoyed breaking about half the coded messages on my own, and just went onward in any case, not wanting to lose momentum. Some of the scenes and players are very funny, and there are times when certain players get quite their just due. Egyptian tradition and speculation are woven into the whole saga and its scenes, themes, and players. The way of the Old Gods interacts with the "modern" Christian and Muslim characters in a wonderful style. Amazing that "legalistic theology" can be such a natural story matrix. Before Indiana Jones there is Jenny Benet.   
 THE RAPTURE explores a subject that few films dare explore with any effort at seriousness:  religion.  In movies, religion is usually made fun of or satirized.  Rarely is it shown as a force that can actually make people's lives better.  (Exceptions include Robert Duvall's remarkable THE APOSTLE).  In THE RAPTURE, we have Mimi Rogers (in a performance that should have gotten her some awards) as a telephone operator ("What city, please?) by day and a party-girl swinger by night.  She leads a VERY hedonistic lifestyle...one that clearly leaves her empty and full of self-loathing...as it would any thinking person.  During one of her trysts, she meets David Duchovny, and the two develop a closeness (despite Duchovny's horrible mullet!).  Meanwhile, Rogers begins to overhear conversations at the workplace about The Rapture and other portents of the end of the world.  She is drawn to these people, because they seem to have a peace and a certainty that's missing from her life.  Eventually, she is born again and even manages to bring Duchovny along with her.  Years later, her faith is put to the test, and she undergoes some severe personal loss.  When the rapture does arrive (this is when God is supposed to call all the Christians to heaven just prior to the start of the end times), Rogers has some mixed feelings.  I know this paragraph doesn't tell much, but if I go into details, I easily spoil the second half of the film...and it's full of interesting ethical, moral and religious dilemnas.    Here's what I like.  Rogers is great.  She's almost worth the price of admission on her own.  She's never done anything since to approach this.  Will Patton, in a small but important role, is charismatic.  And as an X-Files fan, Duchovny is an added bonus.    Furthermore, as I said, the film explores...without laughing...the idea that believing in God and turning your life over to Jesus is a viable choice.  That Christians do find peace in their choice and that God does perhaps answer prayers.  Whether one is a Christian or not...one must also recognize that a lot of people are and that it is a lifestyle that the movies all but ignore.  However, that being said, the movie does depict all its Christians as being obsessed with prophecy about the end times, the coming apocalypse and the rapture.  Yes, many Christians are concerned with this.  But the vast majority of "mainstream" Christianity hesitates to try to interpret the Book of Revelations and discussions of what the end of the world will be like are avoided.  Revelations is too strange.  The movie would have you believe that this is pretty much the only book in the Bible that Christians read.  I would have liked more balance...fewer extremes.  Just as Rogers character at the beginning is extreme in her hedonism...so is she extreme in her beliefs.  But at least they aren't mocked, and I liked that.  There has never really been a movie quite like THE RAPTURE before.  It takes on big subjects and isn't afraid to provoke thought or debate.  It has moments of pretty raw emotion.  While obviously made on a VERY low budget...that helps the film seem more real, the people more mundane and down to earth.  The film is a hard R, and should not be viewed by kids...who would be exposed to sexual images they don't need early on and who would be bored to tears by the more intellectual parts later on.  But for adults who are looking for something different, and who don't mind having some hard-core beliefs explored...then I highly recommend this flawed but riveting work. 
 Although rather small and using a rechargeable battery, I have been using this trimmer to trim all body hair, including my scalp, which was the main reason i purchased it. It does have a somewhat small trimmer "head" and by virtue of being rechargeable it is necessary for the user to make more than one pass over the scalp, but if you want to cut your hair as close as a blade, this unit does it just fine....On the other hand,because it is so small and lightweight, it is extremely easy and non-tiring to use. Motor noise is certainly a lot less than my older, standard hair trimmer, which makes a terribly loud noise. So far, I would recommend this trimmer to anyone who is looking for one to use all over  the body, including the scalp.  
 This coffee maker is exactly like the one our hostess used in a b&b in Rome.  It is easy to use and it takes us to back to Italy every morning.  Coffee needs to be gound fine.  This is an espresso maker, so if your looking for an American type of coffee, look elsewhere.  We love this though.  It looks awesome, is easy to use and makes incredible espresso.  This is the brand sold all over Italy 
 Ron Chernow narrates with panache the riveting tribulations of the Warburgs, a prominent Jewish banking dynasty emerging in Germany in the sixteenth century.  The author does an outstanding job in switching back and forth between the Alsterufer Warburgs and the Mittelweg Warburgs, the two rivaling branches of the Warburgs.  Ron Chernow indeed vividly recasts the numerous actors of that saga against the economic, political and social backdrop of their time.  The author brilliantly helps his readers understand the painful dilemma that many German Jews, keener and keener on assimilation into Germany, faced especially under the Weimar Republic and then under Nazism.  Ron Chernow also underlines how several Warburgs emigrating outside Germany had a positive influence on the unfolding of some key domestic and overseas events.  Ironically, M.M. Warburg & Co., the German cradle of the banking dynasty that Nazism and then internal infighting almost torpedoed with success, is the only one to remain independent today.  M.M. Warburg & Co. is Germany's second largest private bank. S.G. Warburg is now part of Union Bank of Switzerland while Warburg Pincus, successor of E.M. Warburg, belongs to Credit Suisse 
 As a vet student, I purchased this for a small animal medicine course, but have used it for almost all of my classes. It would be an invaluable reference for the small animal practitioner or vet student and, in my  opinion, is the most complete source for information of infectious diseases  of small animals currently available 
 I found Gregory White's Security+ A-I-O Exam Guide to be a good resource for studying for the CompTIA Security+ exam.  I used this book along with on the job experience (I also have a SANS/GIAC security cert) to prepare for and pass the test.  No Sec+ study book out there seems to cover EVERYTHING, but I thought this book did a good job of covering most things.  I would recommend an additional study resource but if I could only have one book, of the ones I've seen, I would pick this one.  The test engine that comes on the CD is OK, but nothing great.  I would recommend something like Transcender or Boson (the Boson practice exam I used was quite good and fairly cheap at $40) for a more accurate gauge of how'll you do on the test. Also, look for an exam voucher online for the Security+ test.  The normal price is $225 but you should be able to get a voucher for around $165 
 These slippers are well worth it--I bought my boyfriend a pair for X-mas in black suede, and then later just had to buy some for myself. Mine have held up a little better than his: I think mostly due to the fact that his are suede and mine are not. But they are incredibly comfortable and warm 
 This book is a true classic which our whole family enjoys. It sparks the imagination in a way that only few books can.  I recommend this book to  everyone and it should be included as required reading at the elementary or  even junior high level.  One thing you should realize is that this is a  book without a lot of "fluff", no color drawings, etc., but still  better than the majority of newer discussions of history.  I didn't find it  to be either pro-Christianity or anti-Christianity 
 This is a beautiful book, rich in humor and satire. Just upon reading the first page, and scanning through reading side notes, it is easy to tell this is a book that will be easily enjoyable for a long time 
 In a typically odd work by Edward Gorey, the protagonist, Alice, gets her eyes opened to many new experiences by companions of various sorts (including Colonel Gilbert and his wife Louise, both of whom have wooden legs, and Donald, a sheepdog). All these new activities are strangely suggestive, but not what most people would actually call pornographic; after all, the book is only illustrated with Gorey's discreet little drawings.   The sofa itself is contained in a room lined in polar bear fur, is upholstered in scarlet velvet, and has nine legs and seven arms;  when the machinery starts within it Alice shudders and the book concludes in a delightfully ambiguous manner, in what may well be one of the strangest endings of any of Gorey's books.  I like Gorey, and this is a good little book, but is not actually one of my favorites, as I think there are others more whimsical, and a few are even stranger. For Gorey lovers this is a great little book, but understand that it is quite small, which makes it a questionable value, particularly in light of the excellent compilations available. 
 Most of the reviews written here are not for Burne Hogarth's "Jungle Tales of Tarzan" but are for the original Tarzan novel by Burroughs and not the beautiful Burne Hogarth comic book/trade paperback 1976 adaptation.  I now own the Burne Hogarth edition and love it.  It is boldly done and Hogarth's art is at its best and most detailed.  The only drawback is that it is not colored---it is only black and white---and only available in paperback (unlike the hardback and colored 1972 "Tarzan of the Apes" Burroughs/Hogarth edition).  Still it is a pleasure to behold, and is larger than the 1972 "Tarzan of the Apes" edition.  About half of the tales in Burroughs' original "Jungle Tales of Tarzan" are there.  The forward is interesting and shows some pages from both Hogarth/Burroughs' books.  Burne Hogarth definately brings Burroughs' amazing works to life like no one else.  A perfect match.  Hogarth is to comic book art as Frank Frazetta is to paperback covers 
 There is no question stock prices climb and fall based on investors' current perceptions of their future performance.  Identify an error in those perceptions; you, as an investor, have uncovered a catapult to superior performance.  In Expectations Investing, Alfred Rappaport and Michael J. Mauboussin argue current stock prices express investors' collective expectations.   A change in those expectations lies at the heart of investment success.  This is a tall task.   Approximately 75 per cent of all active investors deliver returns below those posted by passive index funds.  The authors argue poor performance is built on a foundation of poor tool selection, high costs, and short-term vision and style limitations.  They argue investment performance can be improved by following three simple steps:  1.	Estimate Price-Implied Expectations.  Forget earnings and cash-flow estimates.  Long-term discounted cash-flow models market performance. 2.	Identify Opportunities.  Expectation changes lead to changes in market evaluations.  Whether you are looking at innovative technology or value, developed or developing markets, new or old economies, these principles are universal. 3.	Develop a Disciplined Buy, Hold or Sell Strategy.    The ramifications of this discipline are they remove three misconceptions from investment thinking:  1.	The market is short-term. 2.	Earning per share dictate value. 3.	Price-earning rations determine value.  This well-written and thought provoking book harnesses the market power of discounted cash flow without requiring difficult and dubious long-term forecasts.  It helps the serious investor develop a theory of where he or she is headed, why and more important, the courage to ignore advice that has nothing to do with underlying value.  
 I have lusted after this edition of the Superman: The Movie soundtrack ever since it originally came out back in 2000. I was heartbroken when I found that it very quickly went out of print and became a rather hard-to-find item in the market, commanding $75-$100 price tags from third-party sellers.  I was ecstatic when it just very recently became available again (no doubt to take advantage of the new Superman Returns movie coming out next month) and just got my hands on it today. I'm listening to it right now as I write this and it is an absolute joy to experience. You'd certainly be hard-pressed to find a grander, more memorable set of music for a comic-book character (or any character, really!) Just aces.  However, I'm more than a little disappointed at how this recent pressing seems to lack the rather extensive liner notes that originally came with this edition in 2000(all it has is a single paper slip with the cover on the front and a B&W photo of Jor-El and Lara on the reverse). I'm a little baffled by this and would like to know if anyone has any info regarding this situation. Are all copies lacking the notes, or is it just that I had the bad luck of getting an incomplete copy and should return it for a replacement? Any help would be appreciated...  Liner notes (or lack thereof) notwithstanding, the music on this CD is quite simply brilliant, both technically and creatively. Plus the chronological listing of tracks and bonus material are an added treat for completists. So, the music gets 5+ stars, but the packaging (with the missing booklet) brings it down a notch. Still, a great buy, especially if you have a soft spot for the Big Guy, like me 
 This clever book takes the analogy of playing cards and teaches the reader how to know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em. Maxey and Bremer not only suggest excellent strategies for success in life and work, they offer very specific ideas and tips for how to implement your strategy. This is an interactive book that encourages the reader to not only absorb the ideas, but actually figure out how to implement them. Using real-life stories and analogies, the authors illustrate each message in a memorable way. If you follow their advice and do what each card suggests, you'll develop a your own strategy that's guaranteed to be successful. There are at least 52 reasons to really like this book 
 Action packed and fun to watch.  My kids loved it 
 My Daughter did 13 Months at Peninsula Village and it was her saviour as well. This is one of th emost respected centers in the world. At a cost of $9600 per month it had better be. We are pleased with the staff and Peninsula Village and they gave us our child back after 13 months a totally better person. The person who wrote this book trumped it up to sell books bottom line. Their is a lot of non truth items in this book 
 This book does a very good job of helping woodworkers price their work.  The method of determing a selling price is straight forward and clear.  The one thing I would like to have seen is a bit more information on how the hourly rates were arrived at.  Was it a survey, some  govt. publication, or what? Regardless, this is a good book for those of us just opening our woodworking business.  A good read and a good reference 
 This book captivated me from moment one -- beautiful writing, fantastic story, with some mind-blowing moments in terms of discovering things about Evita's life.  My only wish is that at the end there was a concrete explanation of just how much of it was fact -- I know that a great deal of it was -- and what was fiction. 
 I love the ability to take this book with me wherever I want to go to fuel my inspirational fires whenever needed.  This slim book is about the size of a magazine, so it'll go into a backpack or any other kind of "carrying bag" with ease.  Even though there are few pages compared to some art books, this book is FULL.  Not one centimeter of this book was left untouched by the talents of the artists collaborating on this project.  I'm hungry for more and will certainly be making future purchase from any one of the artists listed in this book 
 I ordered this product on a Thursday and received it on the following Tuesday.  The package was in great shape when it arrived. It only took us an hour and a half to put it together.  The instructions are very easy to follow.  I am very happy with this purchas 
 I have to agree with the previous reviewers that this book wrapped things up too quickly and didn't tie up all of the loose ends.  I would've liked to have seen the story of Daniel elaborated on more and also would've loved to have found out the truth about Isaac's kidnapping.  Who did it?  How did it happen?  I hate that I was left with too many questions.  At a recent book signing with Beverly Lewis, she did say that this was the last book in this series.  As sad as that is, I still look forward to her next book(s) and will still hold this series fondly in my heart 
 I dont understand why people are complaining about this dress. First of all I went to the American apparel store and the style is meant to be "trendy" aka the bottom was cut and it wasnt sewn together. so dont blame Andrew for the "quality". and if you paid $9 for a dress dont expect designer stuff. its a basic t-shirt dress, it looks cute, it is on the small side, the edges are cut but not finished, you get what you pay for!! 
      I like the story because it relates to delays and that, when the time is right, they can be overcome 
 If you are interested in how FDR turned the country around and infused it with a sense of optimism, replacing fear and confusion with purpose and concrete plans, read this book.  A more descriptive title would be  "Voices of the New Deal," because this is a book of the  recollections of many of the prime architects of Roosevelt's programs 
 I'm not a sappy guy by any means and I also don't read a lot of fiction but this book blew me away.  Tuesdays With Morrie is the tale of a student chronicling his teachers slow death to the disease known as ALS.  The story is written through the eyes of the student.  The lesson of the story is to enjoy the little things in life while you still can and the book really brings that point home throughout its story.  I wouldnt go as far as saying this book changed my life but I would go as far as saying it gave me a new prospective on living it.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend that anyone read it regardless of your interests or background

 Traveling do gooder Jack Reacher is minding his own business, drinking a cup of coffee in an outdoor cafe in New York when he happens to notice a man get in a car and drive away. The next Edward Lane want to know just what he observed, as it seems the ransom for the Kate and Jade Lane, his wife and stepdaughter went away with that car.  Lane, it turns out, is the head honcho of a group of mercenaries and it seems five years ago his first wife had also been kidnapped, murdered too. So things aren't exactly looking good for Kate and Jade. Back then Lane went to the cops and lost his wife. He wants no police involved this time, so he hires Reacher.  And thus begins another Jack Reacher adventure, each one better than the last. One wouldn't think that were possible, but it seems Mr. Childs is a writting magician, pulling thrilling rabbits out his hat one right after another. This is Jack Reacher's tenth time out and though it's possible to read it as a stand alone, I'd definitely want to read the first nine, if for no other reason then they are just about as good as mystery and thriller writing gets.

 This book is one of the most beautiful ever written. It's especially powerful if you've read the whole series. I often tell people that one of the reasons I love this book so much is because by book 8, you know these characters so well that L.M. Montgomery doesn't have to explain things to you. She just mentions a simple event and it's heart-breakingly beautiful (for those of you who know this story, I'm thinking about Walter bringing her flowers in place of Jem...). I cry buckets every time I read it, but also leave the book feeling a little better about the world 
 This is probably one of the most useful and complete field guides, in any category, I have ever used.  The 1000 plus photographs alone, are of such quality that they become almost works of art.  Clear and very usable.  I do a tremendous amount of photography of wildlife, flowere, insects, snakes, and all sorts of other critters.  This is one of the field guides I always have handy, as it makes identification so very, very much easier.  The book is well designed in that it is rather easy to find what you are looking for.  Like another reviewer, I might suggest  you go ahead and get the hard cover as it will last longer and this is certainly a book you will be using a lot if this is in an area of your interest.  I do wish that all field guides, not matter what genre, could be of this quality and usefulness.  Recommend this one quite highly. 
 I really enjoyed using this over the summer with my five-year-old daughter.  We didn't get through more than a couple of chapters, and we didn't work every day, but I saw such progress in such a short time.  Both of us learned to look at things much more closely and how to replicate what we see.  We are not finished, either.  The exercises are low-impact and really interesting for kids.  I now keep a sketch pad with me and just draw up exercises for her whenver we have some quiet time (church, etc.)  She loves it.  Now trying to draw something is fun for her, rather than frustrating.  Love this book 
 I've been reading Tom McGuane's books over and over since first reading, The Longest Silence.  I've been hooked ever since.  For me, understanding Tom McGuane, the author, took place when I began to understand him through the element he most often places himself and his work into: the environment of a fly rod.  His books are as varied as the waters a fly-fisherman plys in search of his piscatorial treasure.  The nuances of texture, the variables of nature, the agony of whim ... all of these are met in each watery course and are likewise found in each page of McGuane's writing.   Ninety-two In the Shade is a story based in one of the most surreal areas left in our country. A society awash in what seems hell-bent on becoming as amorphous as the aisles in a Wal-Mart Super Center.  Sure it's dated ... and why not ... so much the more for us to see clearly what we have lost in our own uniqueness.  And how, in our rush to become all-accepting, we are loosing what made us so American.  So, instead of looking at McGuane's work as some sort of 'stuck in a time warp literary irrelevance' ... why not look at it as a warning mirror - showing us the fading last glimpses of what we have lost... and are about to loose forever.  "Thomas Skelton, whose aim had been to be a practicing Christian, was now a little gone in the faith.  But, he thought, no matter; and took some comfort to remember the Gospel according to St. Matthew:  Whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell-fire. Upon occasion, a man had to manufacture his on hell-fire, either for himself or others: as one kind of home brew for the spirit's extremer voyages."   Ninety-two In The Shade, Thomas McGuane, 1973; p56.  Yes, Tom .. thank you for showing us the need for clear vision - both backward and forward.  Maybe we'll miss burning in someone else's own self-manufactured hell-fire.  Maybe ... 
 "Poland had lost a war, this is what was left."  Alan Furst's third novel begins in the bleakest corner of war-ravaged Europe where Poles waited, in vain, for British and French help that would not come. As demonstrated by "Night Soldiers" and "Dark Star," Furst is unmatched when it comes to describing wartime Europe in a detail so fine that the time and place seem to come alive.  So, we are not just told that Poland was left to freeze as its coal was shipped off to Germany, Furst writes that "there was ice in Captain de Milja's basement room; a rust-colored stalactite that hung from a connection in the water pipe that ran across his ceiling."  But as the story moves from Warsaw, to Bucharest, to Paris, Furst shows us a different war.  The contrast Furst draws between a craven France and a fighting Poland is stark.  France may be occupied, but the French in this book (with certain exceptions) are overwhelmingly compromised and cowardly -- and, in return, live better than the hopeless Poles.    This novel is shorter than "Dark Star," and is less dense.  Rather than layering complex story lines, Furst moves "The Polish Officer," Alexander de Miljia, through a series of missions in occupied Europe and Russia.  This approach does not make the novel any less satisfying.  The story of the "Pilava Local," the last passenger train through Poland, is harrowing.  The missions against the Gestapo are awe-inspiring.  The activity in occupied France -- assisted (finally) by the British -- are also absorbing.  If there is any criticism of this novel, it is that the story flags a bit at the end, when de Miljia reaches the western USSR, and it ends on a note that is somewhat more hopeful than events warrant.  Nonetheless, the story is riveting overall.  A fine entry in Furst's series. 
 From the time he is a small child Lucas Marsh cannot think of anything except becoming a doctor.  He has a very naive and glorified view of medicine and doctors.  This book tells the story of how he has to fight his way past that glorified view and come to grips with the fact that doctors are human, and as such are subject to the same human shortcomings as everyone else 
 The book gives the reader a rare insight in the webs of human misunderstanding. What is, we might ask with Hrr Heidegger, the GROUND for these assumptions? and what is the nature of moral thinking. Reading in Dancy is like going to the beach on a hot californian sunny day, his dense arguments are like watching beach-babes, but with no hard-on 
 When I started reading this book, I wasn't all that excited because it was for a class. But, by the time I finished, I wanted to hold a protest of my own.  Or at least do something to make this country better. A true hero in my eyes, anyone who believes in equal rights and doing what you have to to make things happen should read this book!!! I highly recommend it to everyone!! 
 I found this account insightful not only from the perspective of John Adams but also for its insights into American and European society and how one lived in that era.  In particular, the difficulties involved with unsanitary conditions in the cities, yellow fever, and the difficulties involved in crossing the Atlantic.  McCullough provides those details so that we can see how Adams and his peers coped.  I would also note that Adams had a significant amount of time for reading and reflection, a condition foreign to our internet/blackberry world.  Significant political acts were uncommon even during his presidency but much more thoroughly thought through when they occurred.  These are the insights that I take from this work.  Also the tangled rivalries with Thomas Jefferson and his unwillingness to totally commit to the Federalists.  Ultimately his integrity won out but he clearly lacked a balanced appreciation of the political factions of the time.  I am now reading Fleming's biography of Thomas Jefferson to balance the Adams account.  Clearly we owe a great debt to both for bringing the country through a difficult period.  One has more perspective on the current political wars when we see comparable ideological and political tactics during the period of the founding of the nation 
 What an incredible book.  Touching, horrifying, saddening.  It's very little wonder that Capote's life was never the same after writing it.  The ceaseless conflict he must have faced resulting from growing so close with Perry Smith while at the same time having to describe on paper the crime Smith had committed, right down to Nancy's pleas for mercy - pleas which were cut short seconds later.  What must he have gone through in his heart? No one truly knows.  What is clear is that the quality of storytelling did not suffer in the least, regardless of whatever personal turmoil he may have been battling with.  The way he masterfully wove the facts of the case in amongst conversations, interviews, small-town folklore and the events he witnessed while researching the case is simply astonishing.  One great example of this is the chapter in which he describes the police-escorted arrival of the two accused after their capture.  It is perhaps my favorite chapter in the book, the way it flows from the travels of the two stray cats to the throng which has gathered at the jail to the arrival of the criminals and then to the first flakes of snow falling on the dispersing crowd.  Any lesser writer could have presented the bare facts but what Capote does is paint a full picture of the happenings that day, and this style is repeated throughout the course of the novel.  Simply beautiful.  This was a senseless, pointless crime which even 47 years later makes me wonder "why?".  It was all for nothing, the destruction of a wonderful family (and, on a larger scale, the destruction of a once quiet, trusting community) by two sad and misled individuals.  Capote's work untangles some of the mess and leaves us with a measure of understanding, though that understanding only leaves the reader more frustrated, wishing something could have been done to alter the course of fate...that of the Clutters, of their killers, and of Truman Capote

 A taut thriller set during Spain's hosting of the 1982 World Cup. Former ETA Basque terrorists own a hotel outside Barcelona where the Polish team is staying. One of them, Carlos, has allowed two fugitive terrorists to  hide out on the grounds without telling his compatriots. The tension  gradually mounts as the police close in, others at the hotel find out, and  relationships get tangled and tense until the stunning denouement. What  raises the book above the level your average thriller is the author's  brilliance at getting inside Carlos's head to illuminate his ambivalence  about his former activities and current allegiances, as well as his  relationships to his dead mentor and mad brother. Gripping book, would make  a very interesting film in the right hands 
 The book provides an excellent guide to the basics of Feng Shui without expecting you to spend a lifetime studying it. The layout of the book allows you to go instantly to the life area that needs improvement and then  provides concrete, step by step instructions. Another plus: It actually  works!!! I was so impressed that after losing the book in a move I went  on-line to order another one. A great reference book 
 This book will change your life and awaken you to the life God has called you to. Fluent and well-written, this book is sure to inspire you. 
 One of the few authoritative books on pre-Iraq war intelligence, Risen interviewed CIA agents and sources where possible.  One of the surprises for Americans is that a group of Iraqi-Americans braved incarceration in Iraq to get information on WMD and the state of the Iraqi nuclear program BEFORE the war was launched.  The courage and patriotism of these people could have saved many lives if the media had done their job.  Learn more about the intelligence-gathering process and those who perform it.    Despite what was said about the CIA's "failures," it was not the agents, citizen assistance or analysts who failed America, it was America who failed to acknowledge or use their assiduously-collected information.  Some may disagree, I found this book one of the best arguments for the discontinuation of secrecy in our government.  Aside from exercising discretion to protect agents in the field, I could find no good reason why this information was not made public immediately after  agents had returned and filed reports.  It would have saved many young men and women on both sides from death, maiming, and worse.  Had there not been such a clamping-down on the truth by this administration, this book would have been a 5 star offering.  Nonetheless, Risen did an admirable job 
 The over-riding theme of Manly P. Hall's book is that the most basic secret teaching is that one should overcome your animal, lower, inferior nature of lust, hatred, and greed and become more spiritual, realizing that this world is an illusion, which isn't your true home, and your body is not your true self. By following the golden rule instead of the rule of gold, one can become enlightened enough to avoid ever having to come back to this awful world again. Wisdom is to be valued more than gold. If you do not attain such spiritual wisdom, you are doomed to repeat your experiences by reincarnating or you may experience hell or purgatory, according to some faith traditions.   Hall criticizes modern times as being too materialistic. The more you focus on earthly desires, the more you become bound to it, the more misery you shall suffer here and after death. You should follow the urges of your higher self, the spirit and soul, which operate above you in the heavenly realms as your body stays upon on this earth while you learn your lessons.  But as far as lust goes, Hall does not recommend that everyone become celibate, since if you are not particularly enlightened it would not be appropriate for you and may lead to neurosis.    Hall goes over the symbolism of many esoteric traditions in this mostly interesting, but sometimes boring book. This is a big, long, thick book that is crammed with so much information it's hard to remember it all. A lot of the explanations of symbols gets tedious after awhile and I asked the question occasionally, "Why should this be important to me?" Especially dense was the sections on the Kabala symbolism. Hall also goes over Biblical symbolism as allegorical true, not literally true, and it is based on earlier pagan traditions.   I liked the sections on black magic versus white magic and the life of Doctor Faust, who Hall claims was a real person. Hall warns us never to get involved with black magic and make pacts with evil spirits for our own temporal and selfish gain since we will be doomed to serve the spirit for eternity once we break one of the conditions of the contract as Faust did. Such evil comes from selfishness, the source of all evil. Hall is even cautions us against hypnosis and calls high pressure salesmanship a form of black magic. He says that mediums that pretend to be speaking to dead loved ones are actually elemental spirits acting like dead loved ones. It is not good to dabble in black magic just out of curiosity. I was surprised he sounded so much like a fundamentalist preacher on this topic.     White magic, however, seems to be okay with him and he has a section in which one is shown how magic can be used by invoking Christ's name and giving him the glory, using it for the expansion of your wisdom, not the fulfillment of your selfish desires.   Hall gets into the question of who really wrote Shakespeare's plays. Shakespeare himself really did not have the educational background to be able write the plays that had so many erudite references. Hall shows us that Francis Bacon was the one who wrote the plays and the various ways that he gave clues that he actually did write them. Francis Bacon was also a freemason who had the knowledge of how to conceal information through cryptograms, which are contained in his writings.   The book covers a myriad of esoteric topics and persuades the reader to take seriously the phenomena of alchemy, the Delphic oracles, and the mysterious Saint Germaine, among other things. The freemasonic origins of the United States is covered some also.   Alchemy is the process of turning base metals into gold. Metaphysically, humans are also attempting over several lifetimes to eliminate their base natures and turn to the golden light of virtue. That is what alchemy allegorically represents. Hall gives of us some examples in history in which alchemy was said to have actually occurred.   The French and American Revolutions were inspired by the freemasons. This occult group wanted to get rid of the tyranny of monarchy, the ignorance of the general populace, and the superstitions of the church. By electing a philosophical elect, the people would be well served by their governments (in theory). The original seal of the US might actually be the occult symbol of the phoenix, instead of the eagle. The French Revolution was not as successful for the freemasons since a violent reign of terror ensued, perpetrated by fanatics.   Why is the occult kept hidden from the general populace? It is hidden because of the prejudice against certain occult teachings that people aren't ready to accept. The powerful status quo is also threatened by such teachings. There is the prohibition of against throwing your pearls before swine who will only abuse such teachings. One must be worthy to accept the mysteries, which means that you have to be moral enough to receive the teachings. Mystery schools often have initiates go through many trying ordeals before they are considered worthy enough to reach the next level of wisdom.   Some occultists have a reputation for being immoral though. Hall explains that occult schools are only as good as the people in control of them. Over the years, a once virtuous group can become corrupted. That is the reason why some occult groups are considered bad.     
 At last! An easy to read book true to Bohm's vision of dialogue that will begin moving the subject from an esoteric phenomenon to a practice attainable by many.  This book should not be considered as a primer on dialogue that could replace works such as "On Dialogue" or "dialogue, the art and practice of thinking together", rather it presents the author's experience in practical application of many of the concepts and principles discussed in those earlier works 
 This book is fantastic but its two other sequels are not worth reading. The story is about a very large mysterious asteroid that takes up an orbit around the earth. The only problem is that the inner dimensions do not match the outer dimensions. The story becomes a race between the Russians and the Americans to see who can get to the asteroid first to study the findings.  Eon is about another world, which exists inside this rock, but is also a portal to a dimension called THE WAY which is inhabited by millions and billions of different species. The WAY is also going through a dramatic change and it is up to the explorers to discover what the WAY truly is and why the asteroid has arrived to orbit the Earth. Lots of story and action but be careful because the actual descriptions of the places in this book require a lot of imagination. Great story, great plot, lots of action and a great character called Olmy.  My bet is that the Matrix filmmakers will try and give this book a bash sometime. It is said to be un-filmable but maybe they can pull it off. The production company is also called EON... hmmmm.. 
 Virginia Woolf was a true literary genius, with a gift for capturing the emotional lives of her characters that isn't often seen in modern writing.  That said, To the Lighthouse is one of her more difficult works; it follows the character's internal lives in a very Joyce-ian way, and like all true stream of consciousness writing, can be hard to fully comprehend.  But the depth of feeling she manages to encapsulate with her deft turn of phrase is remarkable, and well worth reading.  I don't recommend this novel for those who have never read Woolf before.  Start with Mrs. Dalloway, and when you read To the Lighthouse later, you'll appreciate it more.  
 I am so glad that Ms. Greer has once more emerged from wherever she keeps herself to grace us with her passion, wit and insight. The Female Eunuch is one of my all-time favorite books, and finding The Whole Woman was like discovering precious gems in a hidden treasure chest. This woman has more guts than the average truck driver, and I for one appreciate this. As a woman, I cannot imagine a culture in which she did not exist. Critics have broken their necks in the race to marginalize and minimize her work, but as Elwood P. Dowd said, "That's just envy, my dear." This is an impressive legacy to all women, and I can't fathom the bad reviews here. Are you in the bargain for some food for thought? I suggest that you get this amazing book 
 Oscar nominee Matt Dillon (Best Supporting Actor, Crash) gives one of his best performances in "Drugstore Cowboy" directed by Oscar nominated director Gus Van Sant (Best Director, Good Will Hunting). This movie is truly a masterpiece, both as a drug movie and as a piece of entertainment. It's also probably my favorite movie by Van Sant, who moves from big budget movies to independent movies faster than Liz Taylor switches husbands. This movie, which was co-written by Van Sant, is probably Van Sant's masterpiece. It's not his best film, but for as far as movies he's written (I didn't dig "Elephant" or "Last Days" that much) it's really good. The movie stars Dillon as Bob, a drug addict who robs drug stores as a way to support his habit. Bob runs a crew that consists of his wife Diane (Kelly Lynch), Rick (James Le Gros), and Nadine (Heather Graham). Each of them is heavily addicted to drugs and high all the time...ALL the time. They're also smart, every time the cops catch on they move. The movie's portrayal of the addicts is good, but not entirely accurate and this movie doesn't have the effects and editing that later drug films like "Requiem for a Dream" or "Spun" has, but unlike those films you feel sympathy for the characters and like the characters. The movie is also pretty funny, I love the scene with the cop and the window. The dialouge is great, especially some of the speeches. Dillon was robbed of an Oscar nomination. This is truly one of those great movies, I highly recommend it.  GRADE: A 
 I love Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins in this movie!  The plot is simple - three families of different social classes collide, with tragic consequences for one impoverished couple, and with a decidedly more happy outcome for another couple.  An accurate reflection of British classism and capitalism, this movie was well acted and entertaining without being preachy. A real classic.  
 I watch Paula on TV as often as I can and the magazine gives another chance to get her recipes and see all the things she is up to.  I really enjoyed the two copies of the magazine that I have read  Keep up the good work and Thank You for being a real down home southern country girl.  Me too 
 This DVD is absolutely gorgeous. The technicolor is so vivid and beautiful-like an early Disney film. I have watched my new copy already three times- it is so much fun to watch on every level. Lovely to look at and the best campy humor to top it off. While I love this film, it is quite tame compared to some of the wonderful excesses that were to follow in this cycle of cult favorite Maria Montez classics.  Thank you Universal for finally releasing one of your classic "Easterns" onto DVD. But please don't stop!! Maria's fans are legion. Her films are some of the hardest to find and most desireable to collectors. Remember of the six films she did with Jon Hall at Universal, only two were ever even released on VHS. The demand is high. Please Universal- give us a "Maria Montez Collection" with the remaining five Easterns. "Cobra Woman" alone is probably the most famous camp classic to never merrit a DVD release.  We want more 
 I'm not an expert on footballs, but I haven't seen anything wrong with the way this one is performing.  It's easy to grip and throw, and it doesn't have that cheesy "hey I'm a recreational football" look to it.  Good deal for the money 
 the book has been of value to me in compiling xmas presents and other similar thing 
 I think that the first man did not know anything about this series for kids. it is a good book for begining to learn cooking chinese food. it even says reading level 9-12!!!.. 
 With the cost of propane being what it is, it's great to have these to use in my toaster oven, instead of heating up a big oven. Have used these multiple times and have been very happy with the quality.  I've used muffin liners and have baked without the liners and both worked well.  I recommend this item 
 The more you read this book and go deeper into the principles of Covey the more you discover yourself and others. For many people reading Covey's book or listening to him speak literally changes their lives.

 Come sail away is a brilliant box set from arguably one of the greatest rock bands ever.This excellent box set contains classics like BABE,LADY and more.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
 As a student dancer I usually like to brush up on things that I wish I could at school or on the bus. It's a great book emphising on Russian Technique and basic steps. For eight bucks it was one of the most cheapest ballet books I have boughten. It goes straight into the positions of the feet. It tells you of what are the correct ways and what are the incorrect ways. It gives little drawings of a ballet practicing the step. If you can remember those little diagrams of the silloutte of feet for ballroom dancing, most of the diagrams are like that. In the drawings when a leg is suppose to switch or the body, little lines are drawn and it is almost impossible not to understand what the steps are drawn out to be. The only thing I wish was more of introduction to pointe. There are only a chapter dedicated to pointe work, clear and understandable on how to develop strength with echapes and releves. Even in the diagrams they give you Russian and French and Italian for some to show you the possible difference. This is a very detailed book, the only problem you would have if you didn't live in the ballet world at all. If your looking for an introduction I suggest the Royal Academy Ballet Book, but if you know your ballet terminology and learning how this manual will save you steps, get it. It helped me understand really what I was suppose to do. Visually you don't learn everything but it breaks it down perfectly to really know what your doing physically than visually 
 Patric Kuh is a food critic for Los Angeles Magazine currently, although he has been a chef and has traveled widely. He grew up in Spain and Ireland, then headed to France to learn cooking.   He spent some time working in the kitchen of "21" in New York and then for a San Francisco couple before ending up in Los Angeles. This book describes and explains the evolution of fine cuisine in the United States from the introduction of French cooking in the 1939 Chicago World's Fair to the foundation of Alice Water's Chez Panisse (and beyond). The writing is lucid and interesting. Highly recommended 
 I happily used this book to teach the main ingredients of the short story.  I frequently give it as a gift.  Living near a Federal Refuge and knowing the snow goose well make this such a wonderful example because the Essex setting is so similar to the Forsythe Refuge.  The story is timeless, as are the characters.  There are lessons within for all of us. The historical aspect of the book is often new to children, who may not be familiar with Dunkirk 
 this book is wonderful! It's perfect for a traveler or someone who just wants to learn Japanese. It gives you uncompleted sentences like "I like-" or "I have a-" and then provides you with words in the English-Japanese dictionary in the back. It also has things listed by categories like "student life" and "request and complaints". In the back there is also a Japanese-English dictionary. This awesome book also contains the Hiranga and Katakana alphabets. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's even bothered to read my reveiw 
 should you spend another day without owning this. I urge you to buy this now, this is perfection on cd. Do yourself the biggest favour you've ever done and click on buy this now. Do it now before they're all gone 
 Of all the wildflower books I've seen, this one does the best job at helping you identify your unknown flower. This book uses a decision tree that guides you to the flower by answering questions about the flower's characteristics.  e.g. if flower has regular shape go to p. 12, if irregular go to p. 15. Next, if flower has basal leaves, go to p. 20, etc.  The book has an explanation and drawings of the terms used for identification. It has line drawings and written descriptions of the flowers. It is small and easily fits in your pocket for a hike 
 I treated myself to a viewing of this DVD the weekend before this Halloween, and it reminded me what a transitional film George Romero had made back in 1968.  By then, we had already seen a decade of gore, what with sexploitation films like 1963's "Blood Feast", and with Sam Peckinpah's nausea-inducing (literally, for many patrons) "The Wild Bunch". But Romero couched his gore in shadows,  in eerie, silent, (read: no score) black and white, and then rooted his feet firmly in the future and the past. He paid homage to his film ancesters by reminding us of Frankenstein's monster stumbling towards the innocents (albeit in droves), seeking their blood (Dracula), and then to Orson Welle's infamous War of the World's broadcast, a play that would have been chilling enough had not tens of thousands of listeners not heard it and thought the radio reports of Martians attacking were real.  In NOLD, Romero has his live protagonists watch, horrified, as television anchors tell them (Orson Welles style) of the incredible but "it must be true" monsters that are attacking, of instructions scientists are giving which are horrifying ("When someone dies, there is no time for funerals or such niceties.  You must burn the body immediately, within minutes....")  All the while, a race drama which may have been one of the first of its kind (although "In the Heat of the Night" preceded the film)unfolds in the house where the protagonists have sheltered themselves, and which is constantly reached into by a zombie arm or leg. An argument ensues over whether the group should remain upstairs, where escape might be possible if the zombies break through the barriers; or in the cellar (symbolic bomb shelter?) to create even more of a barrier.  Predictably, with tensions arising, even when the black and white men looked upon as the leaders seem to have come to agreement, bonds within the group prove too weak to maintain.   As for Romero's foot in the future of film, this movie set off his own franchise of zombie films.  But it's clear many newer films have tipped their hat to this one.  The Joker of Tim Burton's "Batman" dancing with an unconcious Vicki Vale, foreshadowing the plague that is to hit Gotham (one that definitely harkens back to this plague on the eastern seaboard in 1968.)  And how NOLD spans the Cold War arm and arm with the two most memorable (to date) versions of War of the Worlds is uncanny.  Radioactive fallout from a troubled  sattelite (in the outer space of H. G. Wells himself) causes a monstrosity that completely overwhelms humanity, that at first we have no defenses against, until we pool our collective brainpower....even then, we lose many good people who could have helped along the way.    I am especially struck by how much the cellar scenes, and the hysterics of Mr. Cooper, the "Pro-Cellar" leader,  remind me of the basement "This is not an attack, it's an extermination" scene in Spielberg's War of the Worlds this summer.  A better tribute to this film's importance in the whole of the genre could not be serendipidous.    Fear not...or rather, fear, if you seek a film for pure entertainment value, and not its role in the history of literature.  If you haven't seen it before, and sleep soundly the night after you've seen it, ask for your money back 
 This workout DVD is fabulous- I love how its broken down into 10 minute segments so that you can customize it depending on your time constraints a/o fitness needs, or can do the whole thing for one terrific workout!   What makes this DVD better than some of the other pilates DVD's on the market is: (1) very good breathing and technique cues (SO important); (2) instruction while doing the moves as opposed to wasting time explaining what you're going to be doing (so that you're actually moving for all 10 minutes of each segment); (3) really rigorous segments- you'll work up a sweat in just ten minutes no matter which one(s) you do; (4) short reps which really focus in on technique and doing the moves the right way to reach results; (5) some new and interesting moves- not merely the same old ones you see on every other DVD out there; (6) NO excuses allowed- everyone can find just 10 extra minutes at the very least to squeeze in a great workout; and (7) something for everyone- whether you're looking to tone your core, arms, hips, butt or legs, you'll find a great workout.   If you're new to pilates, you may want to watch it first before attempting to follow it to make it easier, as the moves a/o techniques may be new to you.   My only gripe is that she recommends doing exercises- particualrly in the "core" segment- with a rounded back and not in neutral pelvis position (which I've been taught is the correct pilates position). Apart from that one complaint, its an awesome workout and you'll feel it the next day whether you do one segment or all of them!     
 I love this DVD!  I hope someday I can see Chartres Cathedral for myself, but for now, I am thrilled to have found this DVD. I had no idea about the sacred geometry involved in the construction of a medieval cathedral, the direct relationship of its proportions to the proportions of the human body, and so much more.   It's exciting and provocative to realize that people in medieval times had  a wealth of knowledge that we have lost in our scientific, materialistic era. They understood that there is another dimension to life beyond what we can grasp with our senses, and they managed to incorporate this knowledge into their sacred architecture. The deep faith which drove their loving, intentionally anonymous work may have been largely left behind in the intervening centuries, but we still yearn for something beyond what our day to day lives offer. And entering into an ancient cathedral like Chartres affects many people in unexpected and deeply profound ways. Can the spiritual concepts which informed the architecture have something to do with this reaction?  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is fascinated by the spiritual dimensions of the architecture of Chartres, or of medieval cathedrals in general; and also to anyone who simply wants to get a close look at one of one of the most awesome buildings in the world 
 I have been looking for this eyeliner for years!  Ever since they stopped carrying it at Rite-Aid I have been on a quest to find the perfect waterproof eyeliner to replace the 2.99 lord and berry one.  I even tried expensive brands like mac and clinique with no such luck.  This eyeliner is great for women who like to line their inner eye, it goes on smooth and dark and stays put until you wash it off 
 If there's one thing of critical significance that can be taken away from this book it is the importance of eating whole, nutritious foods free from chemicals and presevatives on a daily basis for the rest of your life. It means turning over a new leaf, making sacrifices and learning something new but if you are over 35 and need to improve your health this may just be the answer you're looking for (assuming from the outset you have no major health problems).  While I found a few of Dr. Weil's suggestions to be out of my realm of practicality---fresh-cut flower arrangements every day, for instance----most of the other recommendations presented in the book are rather straight-forward and provide a simple strategy for getting back on the road to good eating and optimal health (like daliy walks, relaxed breathing and weekly breaks from news and current events). I had always loved foods like broccoli, ginger, garlic, sardines and olive oil so most of the dietary guidelines, for me,  were easy to deploy. Dr. Weil instructs the reader to go to the pantry and throw away---that's right----throw away all of the bad, chemically-preserved foods in you pantry; canned soups, margerines, gravy mixes, bottled dressings, snacks, cakes, soft drinks, foods containing hydrogenated oils, aspartame, msg, dyes, etc. This is critical since it lays the foundation for good health in the coming weeks. Demanding that the reader abrubty cut off his supply of "comfort food" may   become a daunting task for those who have spent a lifetime enjoying these "near-foods", but once you make the committment you gradually begin to regain your health and well-being in a surprisingly short period of time provided that you stay within the dietary guidelines. I improved my health alone by simply cutting out many of the nutritionally deficient "food products" I never realized were harmful to me. I can now work-out longer, have less fatigue, sleep better plus I discovered new, wholesome foods that are now a regular part of my diet.  If you follow no other recommendations provided in the book and simply eliminate all the bad foods that are slowly destroying your health, even then you will experience an unmistakeable improvement in your health. 
 Far and away the most interesting aspect of this very engaging novel is the psychological make-up of the title character.  Twenty-five year old Tom Ripley is an unrepentant con artist, fully capable of killing in cold blood.  Yet early in the narrative he breaks down in a fit of uncontrollable crying when he learns that someone has bought him a gift fruit basket.  And that is the paradox that makes "The Talented Mr. Ripley" stand out.  It features a character whose actions are those of an amoral, cold blooded criminal but whose emotions and sensibilities are those of a vulnerable, sensitive young man.  This decidedly dark tale unfolds against the backdrop of 1950s Italy where the idle rich and their not so rich hangers on enjoy the good life, seemingly unencumbered by minor annoyances like work and responsibility. It is told as a third person narration but the perspective is completely from Ripley's point of view.  As young Mr. Ripley's crimes and deceptions keep mounting up, the reader is aware of his thought processes every step of the way.  This gives the book a very chilling edge.  Highsmith skillfully allows us to get right in the criminal's mind as he frantically scrambles to avoid detection by the police and other interested parties.  "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is a very satisfying, suspenseful and unconventional crime novel.  One you will not want to miss.  A very enthusiastic 5 stars.      
 This movie is full of big name stars, poking fun at the industry in a very fun way. It is a great story that is great to watch over and over. It is also a great gift for people who love all the movies and actors or the 50's 
 A highly readable and stunning history of female masculinity in Britain and the USA, considering court cases, literature, film, pop culture and drag king performances.  I learned that the most interesting masculinities  are not male, and that the history of the occlusion of butchness is a  crucial foundation for understanding gender construction of all kinds 
 I grew up with a big base scanner.  This one is one eighth the size and picks up so much more.  I programmed in over 50 local frequencies from the Internet and the scan features flies through them, so you don't miss much.  The manual may seem a little intimidating but once you know the basics, the scanner will be easy to operate.    Some of the transmissions cut off and on periodically but I live out in the boonies, so that may have something to do with it.  I live in an area that is susceptible to brush fires and floods, so this will come in handy.  Quick delivery too, by the way.  Thank you, Amazon 
 I got the first volume - Out of Boneville - to read to my 7 yr old granddaughter. She loved it, so I got the whole set bound in a single volume. In this form the entire volume is in black and white except for chapter title pages, which is not as attractive.   The good news first: The artwork is brilliant, the storyline is captivating, and the characters are simply irresistible; witty, hip, contemporary, etc. Better yet, the primary protagonists are two females... a  grandmother and her teenage granddaughter. Both are attractive and feminine, but wonderfully powerful, decisive and effective - never masculine or "comic-booky". Moreover, their characters (and many others) are extensively developed - which is why this truly is a graphic NOVEL. Aside from this series (and Harry Potter, for older kids) I've looked without success for literature that includes girls as intelligent and competent protagonists. This series helps to fill a dreadful vacuum in literature for girls - although it will surely be of equal interest to boys.  And then the bad news: Some aspects of the storyline are not terribly appropriate for younger (or maybe, any) children. 1) Much of the storyline occurs in or revolves around a tavern. 2) Gambling is a central issue to the storyline and, although not especially glorified, neither is it condemned. 3) One scene, although innocent and handled delicately,  involves mixed nude bathing (which I personally found inoffensive). But for the first two problems I'm certain that the "Bone" series would have shaken the world of young people's literature as Harry Potter did.  Despite my reservations, my granddaughter wants to hear nothing else at bedtime, and we're on our 3rd time through! 
 Well worth the money. Lots of interesting and thought-provoking stories. A essential addition to any budding or serious SF fan's reading list 
 This is a very readable little book about our nature as spiritual beings. It talks about the Superbeings - those like Christ who more fully embody their own godhood. The premise is that we are all part of God (makes sense if God is omnipresent, and omnipotent). We are spiritual beings through whom health, happiness, and abundance naturally flow. Everything you ever wanted is already yours, it's just a matter of correcting your conscious and unconscious filters that block things out.  There is great wisdoom here, and it's a great little book to carry around 
 Flipping through cable stations late one night, I came across a bearded Alan Bates intellectually and poetically analogizing a fig to "the female part" before a party of mesmerized and embarrassed picnickers. I, too, was mesmerized, especially by the quiet, deep, limpid restraint of the scene, the little subtle expressions on the faces of the main characters revealing their fundamental natures, Bates's clear, precise voice, his deadly serious playfulness, the rich green English countryside, etc. Oliver Reed's reaction to the monologue was especially impressive for its understated humor and intelligence. I was not able to finish the film, but what I had seen of it stayed with me in an uncannily powerful way, and lo and behold within a week I had discovered the DVD version at Borders of all places. I have since watched it completely and in part dozens of times. It is, along with the enormous Brideshead Revisited, the best adaptation of a novel I have ever seen, and a D.H. LAWRENCE novel at that! I'd have thought it impossible, but these fellows pull it off and then some. 
 Over 20 years ago while an undergraduate in college, I was roaming the library stacks looking for a book to use for my Art History class.  I spotted Poggioli's "Theory of the Avant Garde" and sat down on the floor and opened it to the first page.  About an hour later, I got up with sore muscles but an invigorated intellect.  It was easily the most significant book on art theory I would ever read.  Poggiolli exams the avant-garde movement with a critical eye.  He neither castigates it as foolishness, nor excuses it the nihilism embedded in the movement.  Rather, he takes it apart bit by bit and holds it up for reasoned examination.  This is not an easy book to make your way through.  I recently began re-reading it prior to giving a copy to an artist friend and was surprised at how much harder it was for me in my 40's than it was in my 20's.  I suppose it was all those brain cells I sacrificed to good beer and even better wine.  Still, if you care deeply about the intellectual influences that guided art for the last 150 years, then you'd best work your way through it.  Though it's translated from the Italian, it still reads elegantly enough in English 
 "Culture Shock! Australia: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette" by Ilsa Sharp is a guidebook to living in Australia.  This book is not a travel guide, but rather a guide to the people and culture of the country.  The main audience for this would be someone who intends to spend a lot of time in Australia, but it can also help business travelers, and even tourists.  I know someone who just moved to Australia from Asia, and from what I have been able to determine, this guide appears to be fairly accurate.  I am looking forward to my visit there, which should also give me a better idea on just how accurate it is.  Be sure to get the latest edition, as it was updated in 2005 and it is clear from my reading that there were substantial updates.  The author, Ilsa Sharp, migrated to Western Australia, and that personal experience clearly was a big asset to her in putting this book together.  I did sense a bit of a bias towards Western Australia in her examples.  To be fair, I was more interested in Eastern Australia, and so the bias may have been in my reading as well.  In either case, she certainly does try to cover most of the country, and if I were to pick the one area where there was the least amount of information it would be Tasmania.  The book is broken down into 10 sections.  These include a quick introduction, followed by basic information.  Next is a discussion of the people, the society, and moving there.  It then gets to some more specific areas such as food, entertainment, slang, and business.  It then finishes with an A to Z section covering many basic facts about the country, some key figures both historical and modern, and it even has a short culture quiz.  As someone from the United States, this book is probably not as useful to me as it would be to someone coming from a much different culture.  Not to say that Australia is just like the United States, but clearly the two are much closer than people from other countries from Asia and the Middle East.  Even so, I think the book was fairly useful in understanding some of the societal differences between the two countries.  This is one book that is easy to recommend. 
 After the origin of life, the next big step on the way to us was the origin of eukaryotes.  These are all the organisms - including people, trees, mushrooms, and slime molds - who package most of our DNA into chromosomes in cell nuclei.  Mitochondria, the "powerhouses" of eukaryotes, are descended from bacteria which took to living in a very close relationship with another type of one-celled organism; in fact they came to live inside the other.  Nick Lane argues that this merger must have preceded the formation of the nuclear membrane.  Hence "Penultimate Roots Trip".  Lane starts with a brief section on the origin of life, in order to present necessary information about how organisms get usable energy.  This strongly supports his claim that something like a mitochondrion is necessary for life to become more complex than bacteria.  After that he describes how formerly free-living bacteria could have evolved into the vastly stripped-down mitochondria.  Then he builds up a picture of how that partnership led to the complexities of modern organisms.  And I really do mean "builds".  Each chapter draws on material from earlier chapters, and the picture becomes more complex as you go on.  Fortunately, there are frequent recaps of the material you're about to need.  Marvelously, he manages to tell this story in mostly plain English.  A little bit of technical language is unavoidable, but I am confident that it will not be a problem for anyone who wasn't already scared off by the word "mitochondrion" in the subtitle.  In addition to power, sex, and suicide, the book also discusses aging.  Lane presents his ideas on why current attempts to slow aging don't seem to be working and gives some suggestions for research he finds more promising.  This is the culmination of the book and I hope it provokes a lot of thought in readers at all levels of technical knowledge.  [Original review 14 Dec 2005; "powerhouse" comment added 25 Jan 2006. 
 This book dispels the myths in salesmanship.  I would recommend it for anyone in sales - from the novice to the expert.   Reggie Johnson, Author, "How To Close More Customers 
 I bought this book at a sale and decided to give it go as I quite like historical novels and have some understadning of world history and of the role Spain played during it's golden years of the 17th century.  It was a pretty good book and I liked the action.  The background setting was good, esp if you don't know a lot about Spanish history, but the narrator does wander back and forth in time a bit (which can be a bit distracting).  I like the characterisation and the scenes of Madrid best.  I'm already reading the next book and hope they start translating more from Sapnish to English (as that translation works very well, as does the poetry - which is nice - a rougish, mercenary with honour and a love of poetry - how cool is that).  I can't wait to see the film when it comes out too (yes there is a film I hear, all in Spanish) and hope that they do a decent job of of the characters and plot.  This book is not Tolkien, but a good read all the same!  I read it on my short train journey's to work and finished it in a few days.  (I won't go into the plot - there's plenty of others to do that and there comments are all pretty much right...!)  Enjoy :-) 
 Teresa Wright, innocent young woman, lives with her Betty Crocker, mom, Patricia Collinge and her bank clerk dad.  He's a detective murder enthusiast, Henry Travers.  Then there's Dad's creepy pal, Hume Cronvn, with various recipes for poison.  A young bespectacled sister and goofy little brother complete the family circle.  Indeed, Wright is just off the set from her Mrs. Miniver performance.  The virginal attitudes, the very real naiveté of 1940's small town, middle class girlhood never to be seen again, contrasts with the, ah, insertion of evil.   Uncle Charlie shows up, the beloved, world traveling, younger brother of weepy mom.  Actually, he's on the lamb because his apparent wealth is accumulated after affairs with wealthy widows.  Since these women had ended up in the morgue, the young detective, Macdonald Carey is on Joseph Cotton's trail.  To get information, Carey woes Wright to get the goods on the Uncle.  Hence, a confusing romance ensues, but can she give the detective information on her mother's favorite.  It gets easier as Wright starts to get the picture.  This is Hitch's first American production and he certainly seems to enjoy the more expensive production values.  The town of Santa Rosa literally pulls all the stops for the fat man. In those days, folks lived a block from the town business center.  This is the same area where today there are crumbling buildings and high crime rates.  In the forties, the middle class lived there, wandering the streets, walking to the library, strolling to the bank, or the local bar without a look over their shoulders. But watch out!  Joseph Cotton, an excellent strangler, may be behind you. 
 Excellent book.  Has given me many ideas of flowers to plant in this area 
 This book was born out of an invitation that Caroline Myss made to visitors to her website. The task was simple: write about your experiences with grace and life changing acts of service. Within six days she had received 1,200 emails in response! She then took these responses and wove many of them into this beautiful, remarkable book that I consider a manual for, as she refers to it, life in "earth school."   The most amazing part of the book for me was how Ms. Myss was able to take the many and varied responses and associate each one with one of the seven chakras. For example, chakra one is our connection to our roots, the physical world, and family. Acts of service associated with this chakra would include giving someone shelter for the night, or cooking a meal for a friend. Chakra four represents love--both of ourselves and of others. Acts of service that are born from this chakra would include forgiveness, as well as acts of unselfish kindness (which could be as simple as holding the door open for someone or smiling at a stranger).   Each chakra has its own chapter, and each chapter is filled with numerous wonderful stories that illustrate the essence of that chakra. Woven in with the stories are beautiful descriptions of spiritual concepts such as grace, intuition, and service.  I have been a student of spirituality and mysticism for more than 25 years and I have read countless books over that time. This is one of the most life changing I have ever read. I cannot recommend it highly enough!  Thank you, Caroline Myss, for sharing your wisdom with us. Your writing of this book was a tremendous act of service 
 There are precious few artists whose music is so instantly recognizable, so indelibly stamped with the imprimatur of authenticity, that their work is guaranteed a place in the annals of music history.  Ralph Towner is one such artist.  The guitar solos on "Solstice" are pristine in tone and execution, and offer an exquisite view into the imagination of one of our greatest free improvisors.  The interplay among the all-star cast of ECM players borders on the telepathic.  The music is alternately transcendent, urgent, atmospheric, unpredictable, and beautiful beyond words.  You cannot go wrong with any release bearing Ralph Towner's name.  Solstice is a soaring achievement, and ranks among my very favorites of all time 
 Glad I bought this timeless classic. Wish they kept on making good music like this 
 The Author, a profesional delivery captain, makes his living doing what the rest of us have to pay to do!  The author has probably done more Blue Water Sailing in a few years than most serious sailors do in a lifetime.  This is a great story of adventure, but it is told in a humorous tone.  Adventure, romance, danger, and outrageous characters fill this book.  Each story is better than the last one, and this was truly an enjoyable read 
 The book is not always easy, but well worth reading. It debates the different theories about life, the Universe and everything, through zooming in. The first part is about the big bang en the formation of stars, than follows the geological processes that formed the earth, the evolution of live, humans and our history. It ends with the 20 th century and possible futures. What I liked most about this book, was that it did not present a clear story, but gave the facts, and the different theories (different stories) that might come with those facts.  It was for me the book at the center of my expending library, because it comes with a extensive bibliography from which I'm now selecting books about the different parts of the big everything to continue reading. The best book I've read in years (and I read a lot of (non)fiction books, about a large variaty of subjects).   
 I like Philip Glass music. This sound track has some parts of moody deep string sections which I enjoy 
 Author Gore Vidal takes an interesting look at former U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr (1756-1836) in his last years.  Burr was Vice President during Thomas Jefferson's first term, and best (or worst) remembered for killing Alexander Hamilton in a tragic 1804 duel.  Here the story is told through the eyes of his assistant Charles Schuyler, as Burr is three decades past his Vice Presidency, and still trying to live down his controversial past.  To his assistant, Burr recounts his life as part of the American Revolution, and as a highly controversial Vice President. At the same time, political operatives are seeking to prove that Presidential contender Martin Van Buren (who was elected in 1836) was Burr's illegitimate son.  The book lampoons the day's two best-loved historical figures, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson as flawed and even a bit sinister.  Additionally, the author captures the feel of the times, when the USA was growing and mostly succeeding in the 1830's.  The story is nicely written and engaging, but its strongly pro-Burr sympathies may leave readers wondering.    
 The Temptations were Motown and this CD has their biggest hits and some that I had never heard before. Now I can say that I love everything the Temps did. The talent and voices are like majic. Otis Williams sure knew what he was doing when he put this group together. 
 This book gives tremendous insight into the creative process behind the product we see when we go to the theatre.  It is fascinating to read about how dramaturgical research informs every member of a creative team, from the director to the designers to the actors.  This book is for all of them, not just dramaturgs.  The diary format allows the reader to experience the ups and downs, the doubts and triumphs of the rehearsal process.  I highly recommend it to all theatre artists, from stage managers to opera singers to administrators.  A terrific read 
 This book was written with a very simply and easy approach to help understand a healthier diet.  The style is simple, has some really great ideas and advise.  There are recipes also.  The book was just on so matter of fact without all the glitz it applies common sense instead which was this a wonderful book 
 It has been very amusing to read the reviews of those who dislike or disparage this book (on this site and elsewhere). Frequently, their complaints betray their disappointment that Wheen has committed the "crime" of attacking their own pet delusions, such as one reviewer who claimed to have no problem with the author's views until he dared to criticize the exalted gospel of the "free market"!   It has always been my experience that truly intelligent people are able to make their ideas crystal clear, when they make the effort to do so. Conversely, those who hide behind vague "deeper meanings" and post-modernist claptrap are really trying to disguise their own lack of intelligence. (They're usually the same people who flunked Maths and Science at school!) Thus, I suspect that those who criticize Wheen for being "shallow" are members of precisely the class of intellectual poseurs who are his targets in this book.   As with any thoughtful dissertation, every reader can say "I wish the author had said more about A and less about B". That is hardly a damning criticism: if you want to discuss "A" further, then why don't YOU write a book about that? Could it be that the reality is that YOU have nothing original to offer on the subject?  The tragic aspect of this book's message is that such a small portion of the population seems consciously aware of the recent "dumbing down" of Western culture. Were that not the case, then the author would surely not have felt the need to write this book! Why should the author be obligated to offer solutions to these problems (as some reviewers have demanded), when the vast majority of people (in the true tradition of "Brave New World") can't even see a problem? Ironically, the very people who complain that Wheen doesn't serve up answers on a plate are those who fall for the promise of the "snake oil" in the first place.  This book is an excellent, humorous and wide-ranging read. If you want something "deeper", then why don't YOU help the world by writing it 
 Before first hearing this awesome Essential Yo-Yo Ma, my hearing Yo-Yo Ma in person came from a few feet from front-stage. Yet hearing him on ear-phones on this CD each morning, you get such  erie aura of inner presence, from the Prelude of Bach Suite No 1 in G major, then Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring, Sheep May Safely Graze, full Orchestra with Wachet Auf, "Simple Gifts" played by the Master Musician, sung by the plaintive soprano voice of an angel, two Morricone Pieces, "Gabriel's Oboe and the Falls" + "The Eternal Vow," from the Crouching Tiger and "The Cellist of Sarajevo." It is 153 minutes of blessed, calming, soothing, heavenly, Eternally Peaceful, flowing of Melodies!   After heaing both discs of 76 & 77 minutes for two months, I list it with my top 10 classical discs of Choral Classics of Ancient Russian Treasures, Robert Shaw Choral Masterpiences, Brahms Violin Concerto, and Essential George Gershwin!      Joyfully from fully-retired Chaplain, Fred W Hoo 
 This IS a beautiful movie and I don't regret purchasing it, but it barely touches St. Therese's life and her spirituality.    Do St. Therese justice before or after you view this film and read her autobiography and other writings by her and about her 
 I know it's a cliche but it's the truth! I think this would be my favorite Coulter to date. I don't care if it isn't well researched... I didn't recognize the discepencies as I am not a scholar of Regency history and culture. It was fun and I enjoyed the interaction between the characters. It was certainly not boring. I would read it again. 
 This is a great book for anyone who wants to learn more about globalization and how the world economy is moving to a new age of information sharing.  Most of the old regimes will change as borders open up and people are able to use the internet to spur economic progress.  Thomas Friedman has a very entertaining style of writing so I recommend this book quite highly 
 It is wonderful poem of bravery and adventure for children 
 Ub Iwerks. By rights, that very unusual name should have been equal to that of Walt Disney. And for a brief time, it was.  Yet Ub is little remembered today, despite the fact that he was the true creator of Mickey Mouse. He was certainly a far better draftsman than Walt, a technical genius who succeeded in every endeavor he ever tried--animation, archery, even bowling. Everything, that is, except one--escaping the imposing shadow of his old friend and onetime partner Walt Disney.  Directed by Ub's granddaghter Leslie Iwerks and narrated by Kelsey Grammer, this documentary takes us through the various twists and turns of Ub's career. It has one distinct advantage over the Iwerks/Kenworthy book--one can see for oneself the extent of Ub's genius through his work, presented on-screen for the first time in decades. We see the first primitive efforts he and Walt produced as young commercial artists in Kansas City--the "Laugh-O-Gram" films and the "Alice in Cartoonland" series. We are also treated to rare clips of the silent "Oswald the Lucky Rabbit" series (far superior to the later ones by Walter Lantz). And of course, the earliest Mickey Mouse cartoons (two of which, "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie", are shown at the end of the film, animated almost exclusively by Iwerks).  In seeing the films, (particularly the ones he made as an independent producer) one gets the impression there were some pretty strange things going on in Ub's head. His best work, most of which was produced before the Hollywood crackdown on film morals, had a surprising edge to it. In one of his cartoons as an independent (he had left to form his own studio in the thirties) St. Peter in heaven is buzzed by a speeding motorist, whom the venerable saint promptly gives "the finger!" His work could be bizarre, and even morbid--one cartoon, "The Pincushion Man", took place in a land of balloon people. They were constantly menaced by their worst enemy, a humanized pincushion who delighted in popping the poor little balloony people into oblivion, effectively killing them. This, we are told, is perhaps the real reason his cartoons are not shown today. One interviewee in the film noted that Ub's cartoons could at any moment slip from "Never-Never Land into the Twilight Zone."  The only flaw in this production is that it skips over some aspects of his career, particularly the brief period he assisted cartoon producer Leon Schlesinger in making two Porky Pig cartoons. That would reunite Iwerks with one-time studio cel-washer Chuck Jones, who states in the film that Iwerks was the one who got him interested in animation. The oversight is understandable, given that this documentary was done for the Disney studio, and is not likely to give competitors any free publicity.  Ub is often unfairly portrayed in animation histories as being more interested in gadgets than art, and he did seem most at home coming up with new technical advances for film. The earliest multiplane camera (a device designed to give dimension to cartoons) and the travelling matte process are among his greatest achievements. But it is likely he lost interest in animation after Mickey Mouse because there was nowhere else he could go. One man who knew him was quoted as saying that Ub, having taken up bowling, put his ball in the closet after bowling a 300 game, never to use it again. With Mickey, Ub had already "bowled a 300" in a sense, and sought new areas to conquer.  And conquer he did. Returning to Walt in 1940 after a ten-year estrangement, he immediately set to work on devices that would make Disney's animated world more real than it had ever been. Donald Duck cavorted with Latin senoritas and Dick Van Dyke danced with animated penguins with the aid of devices invented by Ub Iwerks. Even after winning two Academy Awards for technical achievement in film, Ub retained his characteristic modesty. Of Mickey Mouse, he would say, "It's not creating (the character) that matters, it's what you do with it." For making Mickey what he bacame, Iwerks gave full credit to his friend Walt.  Iwerks died in 1971, five years after Disney. One wonders what might have occurred if he had lived long enough to witness the coming of computer animation and the Internet. One can be sure of one thing--before long, he would, as always, be three steps ahead of the rest of us, pondering what more he could do 
 A cute love story of struggle and triumph, each character in this book learned alot and so did the reader. He is a skilled author and he keeps us wanting more. I never knew love could be that way 
 This is a good Javascript reference.  I use it all the time.  Its small and easy to carry around in a laptop bag.  Some areas could use a little more detail.  For example, the one I need the most, window.open--what are all the window options????  Still very good and recommended though 
 I taught "The Pochade Box" and a student picked out "Dead Men's Shoes" from this collection to be taught by both of us. I read this collection originally some years ago and was delighted how much I loved re-reading it this spring. There are many wonderful stories in here 
 Wonderful book. It's a moving story because it's so well written. Really. It's great 
 Along with Forsyth's Odessa File, Marathon Man and a handful of others, this ranks among the very best manifestations of an otherwise tasteless epoch. Believe me, I was there.  I watch this movie every year or so and enjoy it immensely every time. There is such nuance in the acting, art direction, narrative structure and then... Paris. It really is a phenomenal movie.  Own a classic. Buy it

 Any Celine fan will welcome this album into a collection.Jazzy, snazzy, typical hot celine. Any Celine love song is always a smash, but "falling into you" might be one of the best 
 Great read.  Filled with action, good length.  Only regret is that Darth Maul didn't meet anyone that really challenging skill set.  Read the E-book in the rear of the book first, it precedes shadow hunter 
 Before he was Batman, Christian Bale turned the film world on it's ear with his incredible performance in this adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel.  Bale stars as Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, who is living the good life in the indulgent 80's.  By night, Bateman is a psychotic serial killer whose masterful routine is coming apart at the seams.  While it has uneven moments, Bale's star making performance is worth seeing American Psycho for alone.  No one else could have brought the character of Patrick Bateman to life better than Bale, and the rest of the cast, including Reese Witherspoon, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Jared Leto, Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, and Samantha Mathis; are great as well as supporting characters too obsessed with themselves to realize or care as to what Patrick is doing.  A spectacular satire and a showcase for Bale's talents; American Psycho isn't quite a classic, but it's pretty close regardless

 I bought the book because I needed to know more about beauty care from head to toe.  The book is very informative.  I wish it could be more in depth where black hair is concerned.  I have relaxed long hair that tends to get frizzy very easily and can be hard to style.  I really needed to know more about that.  Overall, this book is worth the price 
 Taking a departure from the theatrical show that was 2004's Your Blues, Dan Bejar makes a bit of a return to his earlier, acoustic work here while at the same time maintaining the grandness of Your Blues.  The result is the best album of the year (and I've listened to many albums.)  Bejar is a modern-day Picasso, spinning his words like they are paint brushes and creating an entirely new medium of art.  The highlights are the nine-minute opener "Rubies" and "Painter In Your Pocket", easily two of the best songs Destroyer has ever done.  If you enjoyed this, check out the Swan Lake album out this November, which teams Bejar with Wolf Parade frontman Spencer Krug for what should be an indie explosion of epic proportion 
 My daughter got this toy when she was 6 months old.  At that time she could pull out the shapes, bounce the birdies and push the big counting button.  Now she is 16 months old and can match the shapes into the correct spots and still enjoyings the bouncing birds and counting pond.  Great toy!!  One of few that she has enjoyed for nearly a year!  That is rare!  Not worth paying $60 here though...go to BRU or Walmart 
 A Man without a country or family is raised in 1930's/40's China &Japan,survives some horrific Bombings by US- made planes, learns lots of Eastern Mysticism and the game of Go, Caving, Assassination Methods, and settles down in his beloved castle in remote and mountainous Basque country. Meanwhile, we meet several Western conspirators who apparently stage terrorist events for their governments, and who all have a lack of any scruples, characteristics our hero (named "Hel") finds very discomforting. Though the book abounds in various stereotypes, it's really oddball humor counterbalances it nicely. There is lots of USA, Brit, Techology, and even Volvo-bashing, and a really eccentric Basque poet, fellow caver. The caving scenes may be slightly overdone, though they are probably part of the "Shibumi" that is noted here and there. Also, it is hard to believe that our hero puts up with some of his caver-companion's quirkiness, especially when they could lead them both to an untimely end. Despite this, a really nifty and peculiar journey, which I actually read twice, about 25 years apart! 
 This is one of my all time favorite novels.  It beautifully captures the desperation in the lives of its characters and does it in a style that is a model of grace and economy.  The deeply insightful portrayal of the painful relationships between the men and women, who inhabit it's world, is one of its many pleasures.  Gardner is a great novelist, just on the strength of "Fat City," the only entry in his oeuvre.  
 this book is definetly the best in "the Immortals" series. you can't put it down. and tamora pierce is a wonderful author. i only wish i could write as well as her. well Daine is back with Numair of course. teaching her as always. only this time they end up in the realm of the gods (interesting how that title hooks in) and the best part is when you finally find out that Numair and Daine fall in love. i must say i was hoping for this in all of the books. i'm a hopeless romantic so thats prolly why i like this book the best. but it is a must read. (but if you have never read a tamora pierce book start with the alanna series) but if you haven't read it please do (with the other 3 books prior of course) you won't regret reading this if you LOVE fantasy 
 Most early readers of this new Hart biography are readers who love "Act One." That brilliant book is central to every stage-struck person's devotion to theater, Broadway and glamor. But along comes Mr. Bach, and his portrait only makes us love Hart's version more. Yes, I believe Mr. Bach has researched and read and compiled facts that delineate the real life of a Broadway legend. But by comparison it is also insight into what a creation is "Act One" and the creative process of a playwright and man of the theatre. Hart wrote his own version with the eye of an artist; facts didn't interest him. A great story was in the telling. Facts interest Mr. Bach, and they are very well presented. If any reader is worried that Mr. Bach has been indiscreet, that his palette has too many warts and all, I assure you that he has been careful and admiring. His role as a biographer may have kept him at too much of a distance from the artist, but his book in combination with Hart's is a full-blown, 3-D treatment of a worthy subject. It takes this new book to make you fully appreciate the original, and then grateful for the contrasting study 
 With about 140 pieces from dozens of contributors, this humor anthology is a mixed bag. For me, some of the essays and parodies fell flat. Yet enough were truly hysterical to sustain me and keep me turning those pages. Among my favorites: Jon Stewart's "Pen Pals" and "The Last Supper, or The Dead Waiter"; Garry Trudeau's "I Am a Tip-Top Starlet" and "To Our Valued Customers"; Al Franken's "Index";Zev Borow's "A Graceland for Adolf"; Mark O'Donnell's "TV Guide, Soon"; Bill Scheft's "The All-Purpose Concession Speech"; and P. J. O'Rourke's "Memoir Essay. 
  "Comfort Woman", the fifth studio album of Meshell NdegeoCello is a calming world in itself. The album takes the listener to a completely different place and it is a 40 minutes out-of-worldly experience. Each song progresses beautifully into the next giving it a story-like feel unlike some of her previous work (even though her previous work is just as good). NdegeoCello has looked for new inspirations on this record and it doesn't have as hip-hop a feel as her album "Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape". The vibe to the album is more laid-back and most songs are slow to mid-tempo.    1. "Love Song 1"- A perfect start to the album. It is reminiscent of her song "Call Me" from her first album "Plantation Lullabies". A very nice slow song. Has a reggae vibe.  2. "Come Smoke My Herb"- NdegeoCello's voice is beautiful and spacy in this song. It suits the great instrumentation.  3. "Andomeda & The Milky Way"- A very weird spacy song that I love. The beat is perfect and NdegeoCello sounds good. There is honesty in her voice.  4. "Love Song 2"- She continues the spacy feel in this track and it is perfect. Completely abstract lyrics.   5. "Body"- A faster paced track than the rest of the album yet it is great. The lyrics aren't anything too special but the instrumentation is cool. The spacy feeling is kept.  6. "Liliquoi Moon"- One of the most brilliant songs ever. The instruments are just amazing and so are the lyrics. The guitar solo at the end is just amazing and so unexpected.  7. "Love Song 3"- My favourite of the Love songs. The instruments are great and NdegeoCello creates an amazing atmosphere on the track.  8. "Fellowship"- The lyrics for this track really got me thinking. It is a song testing religious boudaries and is brilliant. The instrumentation is inspired by reggae and is brilliantly done.  9. "Good Intentions"- A faster paced track. The instruments are good and the lyrics are cool. Sometimes I feel it is a little out of place.  10. "Thankful"- Seriously brilliant intruments. I am amazed that NdegeoCello has kept the spacy feeling for the whole album without allowing the sound to get old.    Overall I think the album is an amazing piece of work that only Meshell NdegeoCello could produce. Each song has it's own individuality yet each one fits into the album perfectly. At first listen I must admit I didn't recognise the genius of the album and it took me several months to actually appreciate the album for the masterpiece that it is. It is incomparable to any of NdegeoCello's other work and is in no way comparable to other artists out there nowadays. I would reccomend it to anyone and everyone.   MARK- 10/1 
 Here is an artist at work, painting the nuances of the heart, creating living people, reacting to the subtleties of mood, ambiance, the weather, and external perceptions that make up how we live and who we are. No matter what you think of these people, you have a chance to live with them and understand them, feel their conflicts, their love, and their pains. Virginia Woolf is the ballast that offsets all the one-book-wonder authors, the cynics, the nasty moderns, and those authors who have given up on anything positive in the world. Like Shakespeare, her work will live on long after so many others are forgotten.  That's because she offers us art, hope, vision, and the truth about our humanity. It's all here in this book, if you choose to read it 
 After I finished The Externally Focused Church, I fell to my knees and asked God to give me the grace to live up to the clear, compelling challenge the authors have so brilliantly presented. Eric Swanson and Rick Rusaw have "dusted off" a vital, ancient truth that is indispensible to the health and relevance of the church in an age of political activism and partisan rancor. Through Biblical analysis, church history and numerous, very readable, modern examples, they show the transcedant power of "good works" as both the platform for and the ultimate apologetic of a vital church. So, rather than shout at the "darkness," as we are so prone to do, the authors have shown us just how powerful a church community can be when it shifts the focus from self-preservation to community involvement.  I heartily recommend this book. It is on my all time best list!  Geoff Gorsuch, Executive Director of Men's Ministry for the Navigators.    
 This fantastic release from Rat Pack-era Sinatra from the Capitol years contains songs about traveling and is representative of his best work: His voice is in peak form, the songs are all fantastic and Billy May's arrangements are exceptional. This is that magical combination that made him the favorite of so many. Sinatra really shows off his singing talents here, especially on "Moonlight in Vermont" and "April in Paris." Superb. Some of the songs are slower in tempo ("London by Night"), while others pick up and take wing ("Brazil," the title track). These are mostly love songs, with Frank either addressing his love directly or singing about a romp with this gal or that one. He promises the world and he was cosmopolitan enough to deliver. From these songs, it is easy to see why women were so taken with him. Complementing Sinatra perfectly are some outstanding arrangements by Billy May and, on the last three bonus tracks, Nelson Riddle. There is mystical enchantment on "London by Night" and one doesn't need to leave the continent to hear the ocean waves of "Blue Hawaii." The band is flawless and sounds really inspired here. Another incentive to purchase this CD (not that one is necessary) is the addition of three bonus tracks, which were not on the original 1957 release. This adds nearly seven minutes to the total, making the runtime almost forty-six minutes. Most of his studio releases from that time ran a scant thirty to thirty-five minutes, making this one that much more worth the cost. Buy it! 
 I don't know why "movie buff "fofee2r3" gave this bed such a lousy review??! It's an excellent bed, I used a regular twin size mattress and box spring and the sides were still high enough to keep my son who move all over the place from falling out.I've also never bumped into it or notice it being cold.? I don't think the bed was the problem there.... Anyway,  There are 2 levels to adjust the height. My son loved this bed, he's 6 now and really wanted a bunk bed and we needed to consolidate some space so we got him a nice loft bed with desk under it. I'm sad to see the car bed go!  It's very sturdy, easy to clean (not really a big deal to reach down by the mattress and pull out fallin' toys). It's a great bed and worth every penny! I think the recommended age should go as high as 7 or 8, most kids would love this bed for a very long time

 Excellent, practical advice for learning about dog behavior and thus how to best relate to dogs.  Almost seems written from the dogs point of view!  A long-time tv fan, it is helpful to have Cesar's tips in readable format so I can return to them whenever I wish.  I have loaned the book to others who also found it helpful 
 I've always been a big fan of Demosclerosis and I'm also a big fan of this book, which is a heavily revised version.  The revision is heavy enough that I felt I got my money's worth with this new edition.  If you haven't  read Demosclerosis, buy this book.  If you have, you may want to buy it  anyway for the new content.  Rauch puts his finger on the reason why  special-interest gridlock creates a polity that is considerably less than  the sum of its parts.  There are also some brutally effective graphics --  my favorite being the (declining) confidence in government as a  near-perfect reciprocal of the (increasing) number of pages of federal  statutes.  Buy it, read it, send copies to your friends 
  It seems silly to talk about the literary merits of this book of Salinger's short stories. He's a master writer with complex characters and fantastic dialogue. These stories are populated with vintage Salinger characters: high society intellectuals who have everything in the world but happiness. Although I didn't enjoy NINE STORIES as much as I liked CATCHER IN THE RYE and didn't love most of the characters as much as I loved the characters in FRANNY & ZOOEY, there are a few gems. "The Laughing Man," in which the narrator recalls his Comanche Chief (like a Boy Scout leader) and the way he enchanted the troop with his magnificent stories until his adult world crashed the party, seemed particularly relatable for some reason. And "For Esmï¿½--With Love and Squalor," a story written by a traumatized soldier to a young girl he met on leave, is a charming and disturbing story. Overall, a very fine collection. 
 My son is 2 1/2 we first discovered Barton's "Trucks" book from our local library.  My son loved it to pieces and the librarians were kind enough to let us buy it.  I have had to make repairs to the book often as it has been such a prized possession.  My son is now very into trains. All his toys are now lined up around the house and have become "choo choo's."  I was so excited to find out the same person who wrote and illustrated the "Trucks" book has a book on trains.  We got it for my son yesterday.  His dad had to read it for him 5 times in a row last night.  It was misplaced when it was time for a bedtime story and my son cried.  He found it again this morning and has hardly put it down since.  It is an instant favorite 
 Every time I wear this tie, it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were, and when cartoons were cartoons.  Also working in a place with a lot of kids, they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on.  I've had this tie for 3 years now, high quality, and does not stain really easy (at least for me, great quality).  Only downfall, a little dated with a 32 cent stamp.  Kids don't notice, and neither do most adults.  Worth picking up, great price 
 This book is very readable because it is oriented to the general reader. Chapter 1 gives his short autobiography as to why he became an anthropologist, and his experiences in Kenya. A forensic pathologist is a medical doctor trained in pathology. A forensic anthropologist has a Ph.D. and studied anthropology, specializing in the human skeletal system. Chapter 3 tells about his laboratory, and the tools used for his work. Chapter 4 has many of the cases he worked on. Chapter 5 notes that most dismemberments result from the drug trade or motorcycle gangs. The Interstate Highway System provides arteries for crimes and serial killers. (p.63). Chapter 6 discusses cases of suicide. Many people kill themselves without intending to. It is important to distinguish between murder and suicide (p.86). Page 87 tells why Florida has an inordinate number of suicides. Chapter 7 explains how forensic anthropology developed in response to murders. This chapter discusses some famous cases of this relatively young science. Page 101 tells how to distinguish between bone from rock by taste! Chapter 8 says bones are not solid and unchanging, they are constantly reshaping themselves.  In Chapter 9 Maples tells of the use of capital punishment (p.128), and discusses the various methods (pp.129-131). He seems emotionally involved. Chapter 10 informs us about cremation. Chapter 11 has Maples' most difficult and most fascinating and perplexing case. The two dead in High Springs FL were linked to a shocking double murder in New Hampshire (p.152). Page Jennings' parents made a big, fatal mistake in sending their daughter so far away after her failure as a freshman (p.164). Chapter 12 deals with the MIA in Vietnam, about 2200 compared to the 8170 in Korea. Hollywood movies created this popular image of captured men (p.187). A "delusion" (p.188)? Maples describes the US Army Central Identification Laboratory that identifies remains recovered from Vietnam. Page 202 tells what happened at the Executive Office Building. Chapter 13 tells of his investigation to recognize the skeleton of Pizarro, and correct an old mistake. The exhumation of President Zachary Taylor and the tests for arsenic poisoning are told in Chapter 14. Page 224 tells of his importance to those times: he backed free states in the new territories. His replacement changed his policies.  Chapter 15 may be the most historically important. Maples was part of a team that identified the bones of Tsar Nicholas and his family. Maples draws political conclusions from "rotten, neglected teeth" (p.259). Chapter 16 tells of the murder of five college students over two days in Gainesville Florida. Maples identified the murder weapon (pp.271-273). The book concludes with the complaint that states are not funding forensic anthropologists, who are few and far between, especially in Florida (pp.278-279). Florida is "the most crime-ridden state in the Union". That is a political decision for each state government. This recalls the most realistic portion of "Quincy, M.E.": whenever Quincy wanted to do more research, his manager often said "there's no money in the budget"!  
 I've used this product for 15 - 20 years (since my wife is not a coffee drinker) and I love it.  It is easy to use, to clean and tastes great (I tend to make it strong, with a finer grind than they recommend).  Now that I am going on assignment overseas, I've purchased two more: one to take with me and one for the office.  That's how much I like it!  It also can be taken on camping trips.  I put the filter in a ziplock bag, and then put this inside a partially filled coffee can 
 A fantastic album from Sleater-Kinney, there's really nothing I can say that hasn't already been covered in the 60 some reviews of this album. I really wanted to share some trivia... the cover to this album is an homage to the Kinks, whose album The Kink Kontroversy the album design copies 
 In addition to the previous reviews, I would like to add that there is good information on "Dominion Theology," which forms the basis of so many of the poor decisions made by this administration.  It is a novelty that allows the ultra-religious right to sidestep the primary messages of both testaments.   Fundametalism which started as an un-needed response to Darwin is a major distortion of Christianity.  If Jesus is God, then it seems that we have a God who likes to tell stories.  To insist that there actually was a prodigal son, is to miss the point.  The Bible is a religious work, not a companion book to Nostradamus.  Cruel and Unusual gets to the heart of the problem: a massive delusion of the right-wing Christians as to the nature of God, Man and Nature 
 NED BLESSING: DEAD MAN'S REVENGE (1993) isn't really a movie.  It's two episodes of the short-lived CBS series butted together.  If you're viewing these in sequence, and have already seen the pilot `Return to Plum Creek,' sit yourself down and let me catch you up some.   Like `Return to Plum Creek,' DEAD MAN'S REVENGE opens with the older, one-armed Blessing in an unidentified jail cell, scratching out his memoirs while the setting sun casts the shadow of the hangman's scaffold - it's Blessing's noose that dangles from the end of the rope.  I don't know what his crime was, but his hanging is scheduled for tomorrow morning.  Flash backwards a few dozen years and Blessing is the sheriff of the small Texas town of Plum Creek.  Wren has quit the `business,' Sheriff Larson's head - which used to sit in a pickle jar in Big Emma's saloon, is set to be buried with the rest of him, and the man with the burned face might have survived the barn fire.  Oh, yeah, and Ruby Borgers has saved up $2 to pay for a night - his first - with Wren, but like I said she's out of the business and anyways, she's kind of fallen for Ned. And, surprise, Ruby has kind of fallen for her.    I don't remember Ned Blessing in its first incarnation, but that's not too surprising.  Apparently it lasted all of five episodes.  The complete series is available on dvd and the two I've seen so far have a quirky charm to them.  The acting is good, the characters are likeable, and the stories are a little off-the-wall while retaining their roots in reality.  Strong recommendation for this one, although I'd watch `Return to Plum Creek' first.  
 First of all; I believe that Ofra Haza had one of the most beautiful voices of our time; and it just goes to show you what the voice of liberty sounds like unrestrained free of the theocratic government of Yemen, (the land of her ancestors.) Just to correct Daniel (the previous reviewer,) like many of Ofra's later albums, some of these songs are sung in English, Hebrew and Arabic, like Innocent.  Ofra sings Daw Da Hiya in Arabic, and her lyrics are actually based on a Yemeni folk song that is known throughout Yemen to Arabs and Jews alike, and really have nothing to do with the subject of imprisonment of love, and Iggy Pop accompanies her in English.  In her latter albums Ofra tended to give props to her Yemenite roots by including Arabic lyrics to her songs, like Inta, I Want To Fly, D'ale D'ale, Taw Shi, (from Desert Wind and Shaday, -'Inta' actually means 'you' in Arabic).  She also endeavored to sing songs in Arabic completely in Fifty Gates of Wisdom, the three songs sung exclusively in Arabic are 'Galbi,' 'A'salk,' and 'Yachilva Yachali.'  She was never ashamed of her Arab (Yemenite) Jewish heritage and became the siren voice of Yemenite women everywhere, and some cases Yemenite men, (like moi).  
 -The authors helped found the Positive Psychology movement, which hopes to supplement psychology's current medical model ("find what's wrong, then fix it") with a model for positive health ("find what's right, then encourage it").  Psychological health, which is not just an absence of disease, includes such things as character preparation, improved baseline happiness, realistic optimism, wisdom, and cognitive sophistication.  The authors consider character and virtue indispensible for cultivating a good and positive life, and this book pioneers a method for classifying and evaluating them both. -The authors provide, and then develop, definitions and assumptions to support their scheme. Next, they develop a classification scheme for character and virtue similar to the successful multi-axis Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), which allows psychologists and psychiatrists to diagnose mental conditions in a reasonably productive and consistent manner.  Classification helps recognize basic elements, helps understand past performance, and helps standardize and partially quantify a protocol for evaluating data (this may possibly allow character to be evaluated and developed more objectively than we can today, although wise subjective evaluation will still definitely be necessary). Providing a framework for character and virtue is often better than saying "S/he seemed like such a good person," or "well, I just think that candidate's character is better." -The authors use examples of virtue and character from several different times and cultures for their scheme, and conclude that virtue and character based on an internal quality of mind (rather than external events like popularity or a promotion) can be developed and can lead to a better life.  A skeptic and postmodernist could snipe at this and argue we should not even try to develop virtue or that universal standards are impossible; I would suggest that this issue is too important to be left to the nay-sayers, that just because things are not done perfectly does not mean they should not be done well or better, and that many credible leaders have shown examples suggesting virtue, character, and a positive life can be developed.  This is an eminently worthy subject. The authors' goals, efforts, and respectable methodology are clearly far better than just throwing up one's hands and cursing the darkness. -In my opinion, this book is invaluable and exciting, and re-ignites a proud human tradition to make better sense of character, virtue, and positive cultivated happiness (eudaemonia).  Goodness knows -- we could use it!  Developing flexible standards is a proven augmentation for the opinions of a true expert.  Sure, we would all disagree with elements of the book, but my only major criticism is that such a scheme is subject to the usual abuse by those who try to substitute a framework for good judgment. -I would recommend this book to any educator, psychology connoisseur, or anyone interested in character (one of the few important questions for any human to ask). Hope this review helps you 
 I was just 2 years old when this movie came out, but my grandfather taped it for me on Beta.. When I was about 3 I started watching the Beta tape.. Let's just say I drove my family CRAZY with this movie! I watched it in its entirety EVERY day.. I memorized every single line. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone!! I now have it on VHS, but am praying one day it will go to DVD because when I have kids some day I would like them to be able to enjoy this movie. It's a fun family movie. It has an all-star cast and is very enjoyable!! I definitely think you all should watch it 
 It's an amazing book! Like other books by Yehoshua, you finish reading it and the story still goes on in your mind. Besides giving a fierce view of the israeli society during the Yom Kippur war ('70s), the author also pictures very well this strange world where we are like ghosts barely touching each other. The situations and reasons to take action the characters have are underlined by this  sense of survival and urgence to protect themselves and their on achieviements, despite the sacrifice they apparently are willing to make. It's like they are ready to sacrifice their relationships in order to maintain their own balance. The goal is, no mather what we do to keep institutions alive we end up alone and struggling to keep what we already got as an heritage 
 The book was easy to understand, it can save a lot of money to those who invest in options.  It's not an academic piece of work describing too many strategies without rating them, but it is a very practical guide describing just 4  strategies, proven by the author to work very well.  One of the strategies seems to be unknown and not used by many traders. Interesting book 
 I finished this book a week ago and I still can't get it out of my head.  It was so sad and sometimes heartbreaking, but also one of the most uplifting books I've ever read.  Every character has some flaw that makes them weird or lonely, but the search to love someone and be loved is so universal, and that is what shines through the book.  
 Dolores Cannon has a way of writing that makes one believe they have been enlightened.   I have read all of her books and this book calms me and renews my faith on "why" we are here on Earth.  This book is spiritual, but with no particular religious bias.   I no longer have a fear of death, but only a sense that I am here in this life to fulfill my purpose for living.  I would recommend reading all of Dolores Cannon's books.  Each one is special and very different, but the messages are always the same.    Great bedtime reading 
 I have been really pleased with this book.  I am not "new" to PowerPoint or computers.  I know how to "use" the features of PowerPoint, and did not need a primer on the product.  What I wanted to know was how to make presentations that had some "pop".  I've seen a LOT of presentations.  Most of them are dull.  Some of them are amazing.  I wanted to make an amazing presentation.  I don't have a graphics art department.   This book helped me to understand how to make those amazing presentations.  The book presents its concepts quickly and efficiently.  I was able to read the book while developing content.  I was able to create a presentation where people said "wow".  Better yet, I think I learned some really good lessons that will serve me well for a long time.  My presentations will be very different from now on.  This book is very customized for PowerPoint 2007.  I have this, so I was happy to be able to use the new features it offers (which I believe are extensive).  This book delivered to me what I wanted.  I would recommend it to others 
 This CD is my first exposure to the art of Brad Mehldau, and a most impressive artist he is. It's not just the fistfuls and cascades of notes that issue from his fingers, as breathtaking as his virtuosity can be. As with all great jazz artists the beat is ever-present in his playing, even with the fewest notes and at the slowest tempi--the Gershwin standards are wonderful examples of this and perhaps the most appealing tracks on the disc. Elsewhere he elaborates on Nick Drake, Thelonius Monk and Radiohead to always fascinating if sometimes overlong results (the Paranoid Android track lasts almost twenty minutes). A bit of Philip Glass or other minimalist flavor occasionally creeps in with his obsessive dwelling on a single pitch for long stretches--whether you'll respond to that depends on how well you like such things. Still, there aren't many jazz pianists around, I would guess, who can sustain such a concert as this. Definitely worth a listen 
 The Farm Security Administration and the Office of War Information photographically recorded American life in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The very best of the photographic images taken in full color have been selected for presentation to a new generation of Americans in Bound For Glory: America In Color 1939-43. Featuring an informed and informative introduction by Paul Hendrickson, these photos taken from the FSA/OWI Collection in the Library of Congress document a yesteryear America that ranges from 32 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Here chronicled and showcased are scenes from the the American countryside and city, farms and factories; Americans at work and at play. This coffee table book is an impresive memorial tribute to pioneering work in color photography and a welcome addition to any personal, academic, or profession photography book collection 
 Konik is the same guy on all the poker televsion shows. He obviously has a lot of connections in the gambling world which gives him great stories to tell. There's all sorts of entertaining stuff to amuse you in this collection. I like the stories about greyhound racing (laugh out loud funny) and the ones about playing the World Series of Poker. This is a must for anyone who likes gambling stories 
 I was very pleasantly suprised by this album. I wasn't familiar with most of the songs but there are a lot of gems, kind a rough pe-cursor to Tommy. I don't like "Armenia" but all the others are great. I also kind of prefer the post-Tommy who where they really show off more of their musicianship rather than just songwriting skills. For instance, I don't feel like John Entwhistle's bass really shines thru on this album or Townsend's guitar; but it still rocks and I highly recommend it for Who fan 
 Dr. Bob's Guide to Stop ADHD in 18 Days is a terrific resource, not only for families of children w/ADHD, but for anyone wanting to improve their lifestyle naturally. Although it is geared towards treating the child with ADHD, it will overall improve the entire family's health, as it provides a wealth of great nutritional information! I would highly recommend anyone with a child with ADHD read this book, it will really get you thinking about what we are feeding our families, and what we should be eating. Anne Grein, Ste. Genevieve, M 
 Most books give a good translation between British and American English, but this book goes into a little more detail on the oprigins and reasons for the differences 
 More than a simple historical treatise, it is a character study in human nature and its affects on the human actions that make history.  A classic of historical works in its detail and insight on human action we know as history.   Thucydides is unmatched in his insights, clarity of language and thought, and in his informative description of the history of his time.  A must read for anyone wanting to plumb the depths of western civilization and ethos.  An enjoyable read for any historiphile.    It could use more maps but be sure to check the back of the book for the few it does have 
 A wonderful voyage in search of copies of first and second editions of Copernicus and the revolutions. Mysteries revealed through the tenacious searching for these volumes by Dr.Gingerich. Style is easy to read and maintains ones interest though to the end by the use of comic relief 
 A well written easily readable text with enough depth to satisfy all but graduate students in the field. References and bibliography are extensive. It stands out among several competitive books 
 My husband treated me to a romantic trip to Paris a couple of years ago in celebration of our 13th anniversary.   In preparation for this fabulous trip we did extensive research on France.  The 211 tips contained in this book gave us basic tips for enjoying France and the French.We had a fantastic time and we attribute much of our trip's success to the knowledge obtained in this book.  Savoir Flair! holds a special place on our book shelf right next to our fabulous photos of this memorable trip 
 As a mother of a 14 year old child, I was so grateful to read that my vision was comparable to the author's. This book is all about provisioning up your child. It is easy to love a baby, unconditionally, but much harder when your child is in the teenage years and ready to challenge you. I liked the subtle messages that the author sent - give your child chores to do, give them a sense of self, love them unconditionally, and most of all, be a part of their lives. My heart went out to the children in this book who, in my estimation, are not going to make it 
 This is the absolute best Bruce Springsteen album...bar none! If you've never heard it...buy it now...sit back, relax and let it take over, you'll love it! Peace :o 
 This pocket-size book is an excellent reference book to be kept under hand for those who need being reminded when working in a team.  Since we are a part of a team everywhere (at the university, at work, at professional projects, in our daily lives), this book appeals to merely everyone. The book does not only focus on teamworking at workplace, but gives tips one may need for any productive teamwork.  Five major topics of the book comprises tips, each of which is illustrated, and supported by real-life examples. Every topic commences with Start-up Checklist, which addresses the common mistakes of team workers, and helps to highlight the reader's pitfalls. The book does not have a didactic nature, but sounds just like as if a friend is talking to the reader giving suggestions from hi previous experience. By the end, whether one reads it word by word or just  gives a quick look, the book gives something valuable to the reader 
 I've collected cookbooks for over 25 years and this is the best one I've ever seen! The recipes are wonderful, the photographs are gorgeous and even the paper it's printed on is lush! It's a class act! 
 This is a must see for those who truly desire to discover what John Kerry is all about. He can run but he can't hide 
 I was shocked one day last year in the spring when I turned on CMT and I saw "Goodbye On a Bad Day", I listened and watched, waiting to see who it was and what the name of the video was. I was blown away by that song, a song about a day when just everything has gone wrong and it gets even worse, when the one you love says goodbye. Shannon Lawson is the artist, and I knew I had to buy his album when it came out. That album being CHASE THE SUN. I was not disapointed at all. There is a mixture of uptempo rockin songs and some really nice ballads. Shannon has an excellent voice that works well with this material. Shannon co-wrote 10 of the 11 tracks on CHASE THE SUN, the last song being a cover of Marvin Gaye's "Lets Get It On". Shannon's version is bluegrass tinged and actually works incredibly well, an album highlight. He used the song as a demo when he was looking for record labels, and they were floored when they heard it. The title track is a song most can relate to, I know I sure can, about just living life for the moment and taking nothing for granted, and taking chances. There's some really rockin' tracks like "Bad Bad Bad" and "Who's Your Daddy". He shows his romantic side on "Dream Your Way", "Superstar" and "Slow Down Sunrise". Other album highlights include "This Old Heart", "Where Would I Go" and "Are You Happy Now". Overall, Shannon Lawson has impressed me so much with this album, he is one of my favorite new artists, hopefully country radio is willing to give this shining star a chance 
 This book has been a wonderful discovery. I think it's a must for doctors and patients, but especially for doctors as a starting point to develop alternative therapies. History has proved that conventional medicine is  good but not enough. All-natural alternatives like this are the future of  great health and a must for the aging. Five stars for sure 
 This book is really good for a begginer just getting into the world of game programming. It describes every aspect of game programming, and does a great job of making DirectX easy and entertaining. It even comes with 2 simple sample games and a game engine to make your first games easy. It also goes into a lot of detail about how DirectX and Windows works. But beware! the parts on DirectX can be very confusing if you skim. I also would have liked it if the author gave more code samples in the book itself so you can see how it all works. Nevertheless, if you want an introduction to the world of DirectX with C++, buy it. Oh, and get Visual C++ because it took me hours to get the game engine to work on my Metrowerks Codewarrior. That's what real game programmers use anyway. Enjoy 
 This is the 3rd digital camera I use, and it really is impressive.Here are the highlights: -First off I LOVED the Video Feature, you get a decent 640X480 with SOUND, and since the camera is so small , you'll always be able to capture those special moments, it also comes with a USB cable to connect to the PC and a cable to connect the camera to a T.V (has video and audio out) -The rechargable LiOn Battery that also comes with a charger is a very nice feature, digital cameras are notrious battery drainers, I had a separate budget for Batteries (AA) for my former camera, and those aint cheap!- so you wont worry about this with this one. -it also has a voice recorder so you can record notes when you are taking still photos.  on the negative sides: - you need to buy a separate SD memory because the high resolution stills and the videos take a lot of memory, you'll need AT LEAST 512MB, better yet go for the 1GB. -The special effects button on the back of the camera is kinda useless, It can turn the pictures into monochrome, B/W. sepia etc. or negative, _ the biggest negative thing I found is it takes way too long to actually capture the picture even on the low res. the flash goes on twice for red eye reduction( very impressive results) but the whole process is slooow, so you end up not taking the shot you intended , I am still trying to figure out how to disable this feature so it takes photos faster. this may be the only real negative feature of this camera. 
 As a practicing Curandera I found WOMAN WHO GLOWS IN THE DARK inspiring, helpful and right on target. A long overdue blueprint for getting in touch with our inner and ancient knowing and healing powers. I applaud her life's  work and what it took to write about it.  I am ecstatic that this healing  tradition is now out there for the advantage of all. The guiding light has  been lit - let the healing begin! I have been very privileged to work with  Elena, to be in her life, to be her sister. Irma Martinez Mossner - Oxlahun  Aha 
 I very mush enjoyed this book and found it very hard to put down.  My only dislike was that the books starting reminded us of how all King Arthur fans know the tale will end, King Arthur will die and so Camelot's days of glory end. Although we expect it, I like to slowly come into the story with a fresh mind. I definately reccomend this book to anyone who was a fan of Rosalind Miles series of Guenevere 
 I had no idea what this movie was all about, but I was beyond pleased to buy it, view it, and add it to me collection of greats and re-viewables. Is it a believable story? Probably not, but it's a spellbinding tale, full of the stuff that we want to see 
 I am honored to find a book that exceptionally brings together current statistically data in realistic and understandable terms.  It does due diligence to the topics discussed.  Whereas most books are informational  only, this book becomes an experiential tool to the sceptic that says,  "Think on these things, and discover who you really are and what you  are really capable of!" Hats off to pioneering leaders in the  developement of spiritual potential.  It is good to know we are that.  And  good to know that we are always, "More than that!"   Cyberphysiology at it's finest, as Mind, Body, Spirit are made one 
 This is a great "feel good" movie, but Hollywood altered the story for theatricality.  In the film, a group of students who are having difficulties with simple fractions are brought up, in one year, to become calculus winners.  There is a good backgroud article at:  http://reason.com/0207/fe.jj.stand.shtml  that describes how the process took ten years, so that the original group of future-burger-flipping students were not the ones who passed the AP calculus exam.  Jaime Escalante (played by Edward James Olmos of "Miami Vice" fame) actually built up the system of excellence one grade at a time, reaching back to the junior high school that fed Garfield High.  The way that the movie was done, however, allows the viewers to see some of the decision-making processes that the students went through in understanding that they could achieve and did have a chance in life to be more than others around them, especially their parents.  Remarkably, at one point there were as many as 400 students enrolled in math enrichment classes under Escalante's leadership.  That's 400 fewer future employees for KFC and MacDonald's.  (As Escalante said in one of his taunts to a reluctant student, "So tough guys don't do math - tough guys deep fry chicken for a living?")  Eventually, it appears that the Education Establishment won out, driving the brilliant teacher out, and sending the kids back to a guaranteed failed future.  The idea is great, that no student should be regarded as hopeless, and that all should be encouraged to try, but obviously there is a lot more work involved in that goal than this movie shows.  
 This was the very first book I had read of Jeffery Deaver's and to get right to the point-it was great! Where to begin..the plot, characters, atmosphere were perfect.This book really had a wonderful plot, right when you think you know what is happening or going to happen, Deaver throws a curve ball. I love twists in books and Deaver gave me that twist 
 Too complicated. Watched the movie twice. Still have no clue what the plot is about but who cares since the ladies are sooo hot !!! 
 Jessica Mitford leaves no headstone unturned in this exploration of the American funeral industry. Not only is it interesting as a study of funeral practices, but it also offers insights into business psychology, marketing, and sociology. Mitford's style is piercing and humorous (the chapter about emblaming often made me laugh out loud) while remaining very respectful of the deceased and their loved ones. Classics are never out of date -- and The American Way of Death is a classic 
 A perfect mixture of Eagles, America, Beach Boys and Jackson Browne. I love it! It is a comforting thought that the legacy of these great artists is in the skilful hands of a young and gifted musician 
 I really love the ankle bracelet. I gave it as a gift and everyone who saw it thinks it's beautiful. Great craftsmanship 
 This book was a very interesting read.  It's a fairly easy read and has valuable information for people who will be working with families.  
 WOW.   Exceptional historical research, developed characters and subplots, great storytelling.  A book for the ages. With Winds of War (read it first), this was a 2000+ page trek.  Worth it and very satisfying. While being entertained, the reader receives an educational narrative of the progression of events, the atmosphere, and the personalities of WWII.  Among the most enjoyable aspects for me was reading the face-to-face encounters with important personages of the war (at least Wouk's interpretation of them).  It was the next best thing to having sat in a room with these people.  By cleverly using a fictional family and its involvement in the war, Wouk takes the reader all over the world, providing a wonderful comprehensive overview of WWII.  Finishing it meant saying goodbye to old and beloved friends.  I repeat . . . WOW. 
 Good performance by Billy Bob Thornton. A lot of outside scenes shot on location in northern Minnesota in the dead of winter 
 My Grade three class thoroughly enjoyed the story of Leo.  We were doing a unit on cats and Leo's story was one of the highlights.  An excellent book 
 The long island born and raised singer spent some time in Nashville while recording her debut CD, and the country girl influence mixes well with her New York roots. The deeply religious lead song "Come to Jesus," blends Southern twangs with electric riffs straight out of the east coast boroughs. Besides having a voice with a hint of Joan Osbourne, and uniquely resembling Suzanne Vega, Smith also has a set of pipes that rock without restriction as she sings, "Worry not my daughters, worry not my sons. Child when life don't seem worth living. Come to Jesus and let him hold you in his arms," and then soothes listeners into a calm after the storm with "Falling." Smith has a folk-rock sensibility that matches her celtic melodies with an outlook inspired by faith. And she uses her outlook to ripen her songs with an emotional elegance. By the time you're listening to the last note of the closing title song, you may be wishing for one moment more to bathe in the quiet comfort 
 Arrived in great condition.  I read this years ago and am now enjoying the escapade again.  Highly recommend it!! 
 Great Series. I have watched the first three episodes and they are great. Good quality dvds for a show made back in 1964 and in BW. Good fun for the whole family!! 
 I found this book to be a classic tale of honour and redemption, dealing with love and perceived cowardness.  This book is about a young man, Harry Ferversham, who is brought up in an old military family, thinks he is a coward and is about to be married to a girl who's father disproves of the military.  As a result, he decides to quite the military.  The trouble comes when he finds out that his unit is about to be shipped off to war, just before he quits, but he decides to quite anyways.  Three of his friends in his military unit send him white feathers of cowardness, and when his fiancée finds out, she breaks off her engagement, and gives him a fourth feather.  Harry, with his life in tatters decides to go and attempts to do heroic acts for his friends, in the hope that if they redeem their feathers, his fiancée, Ethne Eustace, will withdraw hers.  Meanwhile, Jack Durrance, one of Harry's other friends, finds out that Harry and Ethne's relationship has been broken off, but not why it was broken off.  He tries to court Ethne, as he was in love with her before, but she has now decided that she made a mistake with sending Harry away, and doesn't love Jack.  Before she can tell him this, Jack gets blinded, and she decides to pretend to love him so that she can care for him.  Interestingly, this story is told, after the feathers have been given, primarily from the viewpoints of Ethne and Jack, which allow the reader to find out what's happening only as those characters do, and it also allows us to see Jack and Ethne's thoughts towards each event as they slowly piece together what is and has happened with Harry.  A warning note is, like many of my fellow reviewers have stated, there is very little action in the book, unlike in the movie adaptations, as many of the events are just mentioned as a backdrop.  But, this is not a bad thing, as this story does not need any major action scenes, and they would probably hurt this story, which is more of personal struggles, of love and honour, than battles.  This story has some 19th Century ideals, such as colonialism, and the fact that there is only one non-white character in the book, who, while he plays a fairly major supporting role, is not that well developed, nor is he a very strong character. Despite all of this, I really enjoyed its tale of honour and redemption, and if this book is taken as a product of it's time, it is really quite amazing.  The book also gives the reader a great view of upper-class English life in this time period 
 "Beyond One" was the best book I read on the subject of having more than one child. Hull is a smart, funny, insightful writer and her book gave me and my husband (who also read and enjoyed the book) lots to consider. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found her thoughts on the challenges of shared parenting to be right on and I thought she had some good suggestions on making it work. Hull did a good job recounting personal, real-life situations of her life with two kids that were relevant and reassuring. I've recommended this book to several friends who found it worthwhile and thought provoking. Hull strikes the right balance between realism (parenting is sometimes tough) and optimism (but there are many rewards along the way). I look forward to Hull's next book 
 I have several of the author's books, but this is the best of the group! Aside from including wonderfully written instructions and beautiful photographs, it is also a source for inspiration.  As a result of this book, I took up Silk Ribbon Embroidery so I could create similar masterpieces.  An absolute MUST-HAVE for your library whether you're a novice or experienced quilter.  
 As a teacher of children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) and Sensory Integration Dysfunction (DSI), I have read nearly ever book written on the subject. Most focus on recognizing, and getting a diagnosis and treatment for, ASDs, or games/activities. This book stands out as one of few that address COPING. It is full of small techniques and tricks to help your child/student cope with the world around them. Some are everyday routine suggestions; others are situational tricks that actually help (I've test-run many). Even if you think you know pretty much everything, there are enough fresh ideas in this book to make it worth the read. I highly recommend it to anyone who works with these special kids 
 This is a great resource, especially for new parents. We learned a lot about how to keep our baby happy and content by recreating the "fourth trimester" womb experience. Of course, every piece of advice in the book did not work exactly for our little one, but many did, and we took an a la carte approach, using the book to customize the best way to keep him happy (and get a little more sleep ourselves). 
 I like this book. I have a lot of experience with Mcrosoft implementations of XML and still I have it on my bookshelf. It could be a bit thick to my taste, but it's thorough in covering all the details of both implementation and XML itself. And in XML there is a lot of them 
 There are four movies that serve as the pentultimate example of how to effectively utilize the comedic genius of Dan Aykroyd, a man who I will remain a stalwart fan of for all of my days. The movies are "The Blues Brothers", "Trading Places", "Spies Like Us" and of course, this film. "My stepmother is an alien' is the tale of an astrophysicist(Aykroyd) who mistakenly penetrates an alien world when he sends a signal from his lab one stormy night. Soon, a beautiful denizen of that planet (Kim Basinger) arrives on earth in order to convince the scientist to send the signal again so that her world might be saved. The scientist..who is a lonely widower with a teenage daughter- falls in love with the sexy ET and marries her- thus the title. This is a fun movie, filled with top notch performances by its cast (Jon lovitz has an extremely funny early supporting role as Aykroyd's brother, and future Buffy alumnus Alyson Hannigan plays Aykroyd's daughter), and a genuinely amiable wit. The key to the film is that director Richard Benjamin understands that he has DAN AYKROYD as his star, and he plays on that. Aykroyd demonstrates such energy in this film that his performance probably WAS picked up by an alien radio in a another galaxy. His character is immediately likeable, and he plays off of Basinger very well.   As the title creature, Basigner is actually quite funny and charming, and the result is a fun little picture that may not set any new standards, but nonetheless delivers the goods with a solid one-two comedic punch. This is worth many repeat viewings. Add it to your collection today 
 This book was specifically recommened to me by a Professor at the University of Texas as a fantastic "starter" on Chinese history. A fantastic read, this college text introduces the reader to Asian civilization in a way that provides information on both the history of Japan and China, as well as a very in-depth look at the cultures which grew out of this history. As Dr. Shirokauer clearly states in his introduction, this book serves as a survey in order to give the reader a general idea on the key aspects (both historically and culturally) of both the Japenese and Chinese civilizations. Weighing in at around 650 pages, this book is a massive undertaking in historical scholarship and provides a fantastic opportunity for the reader to gain a full understanding of Asia, while still leaving the reader thirsty for more at the end. Luckily, a thorough explanations of sources and a very large additional reading section provide avenues for those interested in Asian history to pursue specific topics.  For China, this story focuses around the various dynasties which ruled that country for so long. Beginning with the most early archealogical findings available for China and continuining through the Zhou, Song, Tang, Ming, etc... For Japan, the focus centers around the central administration of Kyoto until the creation of the Shogun and the rise in prominence of Edo (located at present-day Tokyo).   One aspect of this work which so distinguishes it from other college texts on these civilizations is it's focus on the cultural aspects of these two civilizations. The author covers the evolution of art in all forms, everyday living, architecture, and religion in as detailed a fashion as he explains their history. In this way, the reader is able to see a very detailed cultural progression that stands out due to the fact that most history books only pay minor lip service to the importance of culture in a society.   I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about a part of the world that is quickly catching up with it's Western neighbors. As countries like China and Korea begin to frequent more and more national headlines, it is important to understand the key aspects which differentiate it from the West. Not only will this knowledge better inform you of how these people live, but it will provide you with a historical perspective that explains how they got there in the first place. 
 I have no doubt in considering Bud as the top tennis writer in the world. His passion and imense knowledge for the game of tennis is well ilustrated in this masterpiece. Any fan of tennis will take pride in owning a copy of  this encyclopedia which provides the most complete information about  tennis 
 I just finished John Irving's The Cider House Rules.  (WARNING... SPOLIERS)  I really don't know what to say.  Like the end of all Irving's books, I'm a bit speechless, a bit melancholic, with a heavy weight on my heart from the tragedy of it all, and yet I can't be angry or feel manipulated because I know that's exactly how things should have happened, and it says much for Mr. Irving that he wrote it anyway, regardless of the lives he had to create for these people.  At the end, it all makes sense, and you can see the terrible arc of each character, the orbit of their life, and yet he manages to keep it hidden from you, revealing only piece by tiny piece.  The most powerful aspect of this book for me was Melony.  Brutal and vicious, anger incarnate, she came to represent everything dark and backwards about Homer's past, and in a way became the very symbol for his past, always out there, searching for you, no matter how far and how fast you run from it.  No matter how much you hide it, cover it, confuse, blunder and belittle it, it will follow you and one day, it will catch you.  Because it is part of you and you can never leave part of yourself behind, no matter how ugly and embarrassing.  And once Homer was reunited with his past, he became whole, Melony became the sunshine she'd always thought of him as, she shed light into his life, the darkness of his past had become the light that saved his life, that made him complete.   The imagery is powerful, when Melony has her breakdown in the bathroom, and she thinks of how she's never been a mirror girl, but she acts as a mirror for Homer, reflecting back what he has become, not the hero, but incomplete and corrupt.  It is only when he is brought into the light, reunited with his shadow, that he sees his true path, the path he'd been running from for all those years.  I hated her for most of the book.  I couldn't stand her.  I prayed she would never find him, and loathed at the thought of her reunion with Homer, cringed when she would get close, but it was her final return to St. Cloud's that really brought the book home and left me in tears.  Long live Melony, though she lived in darkness, always saw the truth.  I am suddenly reminded of something I read long ago, about how God must dwell in darkness, for he is the source of all light, and thus none shines upon him 
 Bruce Jakosky has done an excellent job of pulling together recent thinking from many of the different disciplines that contribute to looking for life on other planets.  It would be extremely difficult to find another  book that does as good a job at discussing such up-to-date material at an  introductory level without sacrificing too much depth. The material in this  book should be understandable to advanced undergraduates in biology,  geology, chemistry, or physics.  It is probably best read by skipping from  topic to topic rather than straight through from cover to cover.  The  "Additional Reading" section at the end provides very good  references for more advanced discussions.  Overall, I found "The  Search for Life on Other Planets" to be an extremely helpful  introduction and a good launching board for further reading 
 This is by far one of the best live albums of its day, alongside Made In Japan. This concert displays the original band at its height, with the gorgeous vocals of the late David Byron, who is masterful on July Morning. The band opens up with Sunrise (recently added to their set list after thirty years!), a telling song that builds with power. We sail into Sweet Lorraine, a wonderful 'Rock and Roller that you can stand up and Boogie to', as Byron tells the crowd. Traveller in Time is next, a hard-rocker that segues into the band's most popular tune, Easy Livin. These four songs are performed much as they are on the album, as Uriah Heep keeps to the faith of the songs (and proabably didn't really know how to improvise on stage, as is evident as to the tightness of the songs played in this set). Gypsy is played in its entirety, including the now left out instrumental intro, and a keyboard and drum solo is added. Tears in my Eyes displays Ken Hensley with a nice slide guitar solo. This is a classic rock album by one of the longest lasting bands in rock and roll history. Heep must've been a glory to see live at this time in their carrer...long live the memories of David Byron and Gary Thain. Long Live Heep! 
  Don't get distracted by the title! When I noticed it while browsing in the book store in an airport, I was at first worried that this would another one of these overly opinionated books, more interested in imposing a view on me the poor reader than in good writing, and in letting me make up my own mind. I started reading in the plane, and was pleased to find that the author manages to paint a captivating portrait of a group of German scientists who were faced with a Faustian choice; Fritz Haber (poison gas), Werner von Braun (rockets), Werner Heisenberg (atomic bomb), Otto Hahn (fission), Max von Laue (nuclear physics) to mention only a few. For the most part, the book reads like a novel, and with his superb writing, the author Cornwell brings the characters to life. Many of the German scientists in the 1930ties were Jewish, or partly Jewish, and they were dismissed by Hitler in 1933, or the years up to the war. Many of them emigrated, and others ended up in concentration camps. Some ( Albert Einstein, John von Neumann, Hans Bethe, and more) went to the USA, and became the core of the team, the Manhattan Project who built the first atomic bomb, the one used by the US government against Japan in 1945.       The bigger picture in Cornwell's book is the role of ethics in science. By weaving together the individuals, their thoughts, their ambitions, and their flawed judgments, Cornwell is not excusing anyone, but rather, he is helping us understand that we all must take responsibility for our actions. We can perhaps understand how present day scientists, and in fact all of us are faced with Faustian choices of our own.         I liked this one of Cornwell's books a lot better than his perhaps better known one, `Hitler's Pope'. It had me hooked from the start, and I couldn't put it down. Cornwell is not just relying on old historical sources. Since Michael Frayn's play `Copenhagen' a few years ago about the meeting in Copenhagen in the fall of 1941 between Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr, new documents have been made available from Bohr's archives which help us understand Heisenberg's motives better. Cornwell displays a remarkable judgment in making use of them         My reading of Heisenberg: If you accept a dinner invitation with the Devil, it is best to eat with a tea spoon. While Heisenberg, a humanist at heart may have understood this, at least initially, he soon found himself, perhaps as a result of blind ambition, eating at the trough with both hands deep into the stew, all the way up to his elbows.        It is perhaps ironic that the theme of the Faustian choice has a prominent place in German literature, from the medieval "Faustus" tale to Goethe, Weber's Freischuetz, to Martin Luther's Protestantism, and to Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus (Mann's moral despair over his country's complacent embrace of Nazism).          In fact the theme of Cornwell's novel is universal, and it is as timely now as it was 60 years ago, and even 300 years ago. Review by Palle Jorgensen, May 2005. 
 It is nice to see Bebe Neuwirth in something other than Cheers.  Oscar (Aaron Stanford) is too sophisticated for girls his age but not for his stepmother (Sigourney Weaver) and Bebe Neuwirth (the seductress). Women are all over him. His stepmom ignores him and chiropractor thinks she finds the romantic she's always dreamed of. The joking innuendos are quite hilarious reminding me of the Graduate. Gary Winnick (the director) shot this movie on a digital camera in two weeks and won raves at the festivals.  The little captions before or after a scene kinda tell you how Oscar is working or getting worked over. John Ritter (Dad, apparently serious but funny) and the whole cast gives strong performances certainly earning their street creed.  You'll find charming nuggets of truth in this movie, quite a bit of wit, and hilarity. Sure, Oscar is 15 and, rather than opening his eyes to girls, they open his. His daydreams about his stepmom are electrifyingly filmed.  As for the morality, I think people are a little paranoid over this taut, striking film. If you are openminded, you'll find this film is more about coming of age than what narrow minded people think. It is a light film to the touch and men will probably be reliving high school fantasies about the older woman. Women will like it because it shows how men are nothing more than putty in their hands. It is just amazing how much depth this film has in 77 minutes!  Rachel Alice Hunter Chairwoman Teardropfilms Entertainment Corporatio 
 If you want to get really serious about classical studies, consider buying the latest edition of the Oxford Classical Dictionary. This a monster of a reference that leaves no stone in antiquity overturned. There are no pictures, no diagrams. Just 1640 pages of articles written by the very best experts from around the world. The reader will find hundreds of entries in alphabetical order. Topics are taken from the major areas of the classical world: Politics and History, Military, Economy and Society, Religion and Mythology, Geography, Science, Law and Government, Philosophy and the Arts.   The dictionary obviously focuses on ancient Greece and Rome, but other cultures receive attention as they pertain to Greco-Roman society. There is mention of ancient Egypt and the Near East, as well as the Romanized Celtic world.   The third and latest edition takes into account the ever-burgeoning research that has occurred in classical studies since the 1970's. The reader will now find articles covering once forbidden topics, like gender and sexuality. The editors have also attempted to correct the lack of attention paid to Near Eastern and Semitic contributions to classical history.   The editors claim that the OCD is unrivaled in any language, and I have seen nothing to counter that claim. This well organized tome of information should impress even a graduate student with its remarkable erudition.   The are four downsides.   1) The book is large and heavy. This is not something you can simply curl up with under a tree on a lazy afternoon.  2) No illustrations, photographs or anything else in the way of visual aid. This is simply a vast literary reference. 3) A lot of terms are given in the original Greek or Latin. Those without an elementary exposure to classical languages might find this annoying. 4) Cost. A new copy can ask for more than $100 US Dollars.    I would consider all these points minor except the last one, and not significantly detracting from the obvious worth of such an exhaustive source of information. As for the cost, I suggest looking in the used books sections of your chosen vender. I found a copy on Amazon.com for under $25, the only defect was a black publisher's mark on some of the pages. If you can find this book in good condition for under $50, consider it a steal. 
 Reading this book is having an immediate effect on our peace of mind.  Our empathy muscles are growing and our own reactions to temporarily crazy behavior are increasingly sane.  The windows of communication are beginning to open as we share our mistakes, dreams & apologize for our occasionally nutty behavior.  When the 13 yr. who's forced against her will to live with us 1/3 of the time expressed an undercurrent of resentment toward "that book that says your kid is nuts" I mentioned that we were learning more about what the brain does between ages 12 & 20 and described some of the craziness as "hiccups" which are beyond teenager's control. Her face & body relaxed and she opened a window into her soul: "Can you imagine what it's like when 12 of us are hanging out at the lunch table and these hiccups are happening to some of us at the same time?  We have to keep kicking people out and then letting them back in when they're better. 
 This edition of the book, ISBN 2266087594, is not an adaptation, has no vocabulary, no writing excercises, and no English anywhere.  The review below is of a different edition.  This book does have footnotes that explain historical references, maps showing the travels of D'Artagnan, and sections talking about historical context and structure of the text.  To be honest, I did not find all this extra information useful, but it was there if I wanted to look at it.  This edition is "texte integral", meaning that it includes the entire text, even a preface and appendix written by Dumas that are not part of the main story.  Dumas is an inventive and entertaining story teller, and Les Trois Mousquetaires is on of his better books.  Recommended 
 It is an excellent (and detailed) recipe book and another to add to the very long list already in my possession 
 What Happened to (I've Gotta Find You)  I thought that was one of their best songs. They will have to put out another greatest Hits now and include more of their hits 
 I really like this album, but I can definately say that some songs are better than others. There are some songs on here that I don't like. I skip them on my CD player whenever I listen to it.  I like "spirit dreams inside"... not only because it's in English, but because it's so great. It sounds like the type of song that could catch on with US audiences.  Most of the songs have really good bass, background vocals, etc. I think that hyde's voice just floates on top to create a wonderful sound.  Very j-rock. I love it 
 This book is full of great information as well as a great source of picture of the artwork and architecture.  This book was a very helpful book to me! 
 As one of the Hed Kandi fans who have hopped over to Fierce Angel, I have to say that this is one of the most stunning mix albums that I have enjoyed listening to. A person can't go wrong with Mark Doyle's compliations and this mix album is no different. His choices are remarkable and I love listening to both familiar and new artists and songs. This mix is great for anywhere and anyone who wants to hear some great new music. I love listening when I'm working out and when I'm relaxing.   There are three CDs and these with a location and vibe to them. The first CD is called Poolside with some chill tunes from some great artists like Bonnie Bailey, Granddad Bob, and (my new favorite) Bob Sinclar feat. Steve Edwards. Poolside can be compared to Hed Kandi's Serve Chilled. The second CD is called the Base Bar, where the music is more uptempo and can be compared to Hed Kandi's Disco Heaven. The Base Bar CD is my favorite as I love to dance and workout to the rhythms. I have new favorites in artists like Jealousy, Etherfox, the fabulous Bassmonkeys feat. Naomi Marsh, Milk & Sugar, Simmonds & Christoper, Club, and older favorites like FatBoy Silm. Hands down, the Base Bar is the CD I put on for parties. The last CD is called The Electric Cabaret where the music gets nasty and dirty like Hed Kandi's Twisted Disco. Although this genre of dance music is not like favorite, but every now and then when it gets past 3a.m. and it's late, and the clubs are closing, I love to hear the Electric Cabaret. It just gets raw and I love it.   Overall, an excellent mix album that is very much showing to be both superior in taste and selection compared to Hed Kandi these days. The Ministry of Sound didn't improve Hed Kandi very much unfortunately. Very recommended 
 I liked the contemporary approach in this guidebook..  It blows the pedantic Maui Revealed right out of the water.  The reviews were very honest and the cute hotels were clean and reasonably priced.  We met many similarly interested people along the way.  Sara Benson can write 
 "Curious Wine" is a classic romance in every sense of the word. Lambda Literary award-winning author Katherine V. Forrest has captured the hearts and minds of readers since her debut novel came out in 1983. Best known today for her Kate Delafield mysteries and the groundbreaking science fiction novel, "Daughters of a Coral Dawn," Forrest writes romance, mystery, speculative fiction, short stories, and erotica equally well. She continues to be a positive role model to writers, editors, and just about every woman whose life she has touched.   "Curious Wine" is a coming out tale about two loveable, real, and enviable women, Diana Holland and Lane Christianson. The fact that they find each other unexpectedly and connect so profoundly in every way possible is amazing given the political climate of the late seventies. During that time, most lesbians were either in denial or in the closet. A stunning role model in an era when positive, life-affirming lesbian romances were rare, Forrest helped to change all that. "Curious Wine" is touted as "the most popular lesbian novel in the world today," by The Naiad Press, Inc. 1997, and with good reason. With over 100,000 copies sold, numerous editions printed, women of all generations continue to enjoy and be influenced by what she writes.   Diana Holland, a businesswoman who works for a title and trust company, is hurting from a breakup with her boyfriend. To get her mind off her heartache she heads out to Lake Tahoe with her best friend Vivian Kaufman. Forrest transports readers into a comfortable cabin in the woods in Lake Tahoe where both Diana and Lane are guests of Liz Russo. Six women, some meeting for the first time, get to know one another, over drinks, fun, and games. Each woman brings her own story and "baggage" along, which is revealed as the tale unfolds leading to both friendly and volatile interactions.   When Diana meets Lane, the stunning hotshot lawyer, she is impressed by her intelligence, sharp wit, and striking good looks. Diana and Lane form a special bond apart from the group when they discover they have much in common including the poetry of Emily Dickinson. Who would have guessed that Diana would find true love among women? Will Diana be brave enough to love Lane Christianson when every thought screams, "I am not a lesbian" [p. 80] but every fiber of her being is telling her loud and clear that she does in fact, want Lane.   What starts out as "friendly" comforting after a disastrous mind game played with the houseguests, ends up becoming the beginnings of a relationship between two women who become lovers. Each has her own agenda, wants, needs, and desires, but what is undeniable is that they both have an irrefutable attraction and affection for one another. It is easy to love these characters and root for their happiness especially when a less than perfect world of intolerance and bigotry exists. Hoping their love can withstand obstacles both intrinsic and extrinsic keeps the reader glued to the pages.  Amidst the gorgeous setting, divine prose, plausible plot, loveable characters, passionate lovemaking, and life-affirming story, "Curious Wine" is a classic, which transcends generations. The dialogue and narrative intermingle in a well-choreographed dance that makes Diana's world real enough to forget you're reading a novel. The year nineteen seventy-eight was not an easy time to "come out"; women and men who followed their hearts despite societal prejudices were very admirable indeed.   Having won the 2005 Lambda Literary Award in the Lesbian Mystery category for "Hancock Park" and the prestigious Lambda Pioneer Award, Katherine V. Forrest, is well deserving of these accolades with her tireless efforts for the gay community and her collection of captivating fiction. I applaud her with a standing ovation for what she has achieved and for the fine example she has set for future authors of this genre. I recommend "Curious Wine" to anyone who wants a delightful, expertly written, entertaining, engaging, and remarkably romantic tale. It is a timeless novel to be revisited often! 
 books are defenseless against the ignorant.  I bet it was Stephen King who wrote the review below 
 Jack Lemon gives a memorable, great performance. This movie also shows how the disease of alcoholism takes over and affects not only the drinker but his family and friends. It also shows how AA can help. Running the movie with Blake Edwards commentary is interesting as well. Blake and Jack talked about their own issues with drinking and how thought provoking the movie was for them. If you love Jack Lemon or want to know more about alcoholism this is probably one of the best movies to watch 
 My first experience with Joseph Campbell was through reading "The Power of Myth" - a transcription of an interview of Campbell by PBS's Bill Moyers. I have been spellbound since then, and have been intellectually and spiritually stimulated by Campbell's ideas.  Campbell was a "generalist" in his words.  He studied what he called "comparative mythology" - that is, he sought to find what human nature is through comparing similarities in the mythologies of different cultures (including those of the monotheistic traditions such as found in the Bible.)  He extended the Jungian (neo-Freudian) tradition of thought by suggesting that "myths are the dreams of society," and that they reveal, through their symbolism, problems common to all humans in all times and places.    I have owned "The Hero with a Thousand Faces" for several years, and I refer back to it often.  I find the most interesting and inspirational part of this book beginning in Chapter IV (p. 245), where a diagram of the generic myth is provided, followed by a detailed explanation of the content and flow of mythical tales in general.  This could be useful to story-writers and readers, but more importantly could be thought of as a guide for living life.    From Campbell, I have become conscious of the "call to adventure" in my life.  That is, when something catches one's attention with strength, the best thing to do is (usually) to pursue rather than "refuse the call."  Thus this book has become not only a literary commentary and study of human nature, but also a guide for living the myth of your own life.   A must read the adventurous!  
 I loved it! Honestly, this book sits out on my desk because I find comfort in reading the stories that mimic my life and kids. It is a smooth and easy read that get to the heart of the matter. There aren't many parenting books out there that really address these issues (PPD, trouble with allergies and mom strength).   The close friends that I have who are pregnant have all gotten copies of this book from me because people need to know that raising kids isn't all roses and charm. It is hard and it can hurt like hell but the right attitude and knowledge makes it easier.  Thank you 
 This book is for working professionals and students alike.  If you're a line producer, production manager, production supervisor, assistant director or production coordinator -- the book has everything you'll need (including all the forms, contracts, releases and checklists) to set up and run a production -- from finding a production office to turning over delievery elements.  Even if you know what you're doing, you will be thrilled to find everything you need in one place.  If you're not already working in film production, but think you'd like to be, read the book -- and then deceide.  If you choose to pursue this career path, you'll know what to expect, you'll be prepared, and you'll be ten steps ahead of everyone else just starting out 
 Intelligent and provocative story which offers insights into people's motives and behaviour. The cast of characters is interesting, and the writing (including changes in voice) was quite good. This mystery kept me turning the pages well into the night 
  Aside from a traditional recount of the important white guys who did everything, Mr. Schneider captures the essence of the people throughout the modern eras. His time with modern trappers, loggers and bureaucrats capture the sense of urgency for anybody involved in the Park. Initially sought as a farming area after the strategic significance of the French and Revolutionary Wars, lumber and mining interests drove the Park after the attempt to cultivate a place with only 10 percent of its land arable. Mining was sort of disaster at first with many tragic elements. The descriptions of the old facilities as they sit or stand now was a pretty neat journalistic trick.  The historical portrayal of notables like Sir William Johnson and John Brown were real page turners. I've seen the signs just outside Lake Placid to John Brown's house and always thought it was the John Brown involved in the early 19th Century, not the infamous abolitionist. The tragic story of Mr. Henderson and his death in front of his eleven year old son was a real gut wrencher for any tough guy. It seems like there were at least half a dozen fellows who spawned the model for Fenimore's Natty Bumppo. Roger's Rangers, famous guides, French Aristocracy's designs and numerous other affairs and plans sets up a lot of good story telling.  I would still like know why places like Pottersville are called what they are. Where the summer camps were located and who went there. Famous painters, philosophers and robber barons are all very interesting. Knowing the issues and their implications of the future is very important too. Beating them to death is certainly something another volume must do. Fortunately this effort doesn't digress too much into any of these arenas without qualifications and genuine purpose. The real gems are the conversations with loggers like John Courtney and trappers like Toby Edwards. Each offer a unique perspective on the lives they have chosen in this region. Death & Taxes and the Price of Otter in China are two of the best chapters in the book.  Having told a number of people who frequent the Park about this book. I wish that I could give this book to one of them with assurance that it would be read and passed along. I'm sure this is the exact feeling of those with intimate knowledge and time in this vast area. A little bit of everything and everybody is covered in a well told story that spans centuries. I've yet to find the haunting image of Thomas Cole's Course of Empire. I'm sure that when I do it will serve as a guidepost to all that man is and will be in relation to the massive presence of nature in relation to the foibles of man. Certainly the small amount of time left to me on this planet will afford numerous jaunts to some of the treasures scattered about the six million acres that serves as model to the notion, forever wild.   
 This little, inexpensive gadget is exactly what's needed to rid your videos of the shakes. I have a Sony tripod with the zoom feature built into the handle, and it's impossible to zoom without causing the shakes, even slight ones.  This remote is the perfect solution 
 When I heard this band in the early 1980s The were HOT. The Original Rhythm section of David Harrington & Donny Willens was like a runaway locomotive. The original Lone Justice was akin to Sister Rosetta Tharp meets Creedence Clear Water & The Stones. Due to an inexperienced manager's poor advice, Ryan & Maria signed with David Geffen. U-2s Producer Jimmy Iovine who was already bought and paid for, was plamed off on Lone Justice. the rhythm section was sacked and the resulting albums were a poor excuse for what the band had previously strived so hard to sound like. The self titled first album "Lone Justice" was a milk-sop album of middle-of-the-road, wimp-rock! The only saving grace of any of the Lone Justice recordings ever released is this album "This World Is Not My Home" and it's previously unreleased cuts that feature the band in the early original form of their 1980s "Heydays." As of late, Maria Mckee can hardly carry a tune in a bucket, and it's hard to determine which is worse Ryan Hedgecock's voice or guitar playing.Neither of which were ever very good to begin with 
 Garth Nix is usually the first author that I recommend when kids and teens ask me what to read once they've finished all the available Harry Potter books. Nix's prose is by no means a thing of wonder on its own, but his characters, his humor and his whimscal worldbuilding make up for this fact. Highly recommended, especially for the younger set, and any adults who enjoy a little Through The Looking Glass style whimsey 
 I really was blown away by how meticulously put-together this book was. Besides the animation being great, this documentive source included everything from the episode guide title cards, merchandise (including ice cream and bubblegum cards), storyboards, character concepts, and a hell of a lot more! It also includes a great photo of Bruce Timm's drawing desk- complete with all the references he uses such as G.I. Joes & knick knacks. Color photos are adorned throughout, but besides that, there are also great stories of what the animation department went through with the head leaders of Warner Bros. There is even a charicature drawing that includes everything that the animators were restricted to draw (a nude, smoking Catwoman, a boozin' Joker, Batman strangling his foe, etc- it's really a treat!) Even if you've had the misfortunate of not being familiar with this cartoon  series, owning this book will make you realize how much effort is needed to create something this vast, and how much more we need to practice to ever reach this level 
 This book was given to me recently when I became a dog mom for the first time. It's a hit on two levels: I love the dog stories and I like the women's stories as well. It's prompted me to keep a journal about the journey that Sophie, my new Boxer pup, and I are on together. 
 I love it when idiots like Hawkins put on their website "Do not buy this book".  Haha its just more publicity for it.    Goes to show you how smart Hawkins is, when he can't even protect his own material.  I bought an extra copy of this, just because of Hawkins recomendations, and gave it to the local library!  
 I devoured the first 2 books in this series, and am currently digesting the Waste Lands and loving it. Stephen King continues to weave a brilliant and fascinating fantasy tale, one that I hope never ends, and one (thank goodness) has four more books to go.  Fans of the first two in the series will not be disappointed. The story moves along to new adventures and challenges, each as interesting as the last 
 I wanted to replace my vinyl LP with the CD. I am please 
 This book was a lot truer to the television series than the two previous books in the genre.  The characters voices were very much in tune with what you see on the screen, and the situation was unique enough to capture your attention, and plausible enough to believe it.  The original characters were *people* and not cardboard cutouts.  The language flowed smoothly, the settings didn't overpower the story, and the story didn't jerk from place to place to suit the author's timeframe.  I for one am eagerly awaiting the next book - something I will NEVER do for Mr. Collins 
 My co-workers recommended this book. One loved it and the other hated it, both were intrigued by it, so I decided to give it a go, if nothing more than to serve as a tie-breaker.  As I began the novel, I found the author's style of writing inviting me to explore further, despite the story line's somewhat mundane beginnings. Martel is a marvelous story-teller! And when the ship sinks - fasten your seatbelts - you'll be swept off into a captivating world of adventure.  I could not put the book down at this point (although I did had to skip over the more gruesome details of feasting animals).  Since finishing the book two days ago, I find myself pondering it over and over, wondering which of the two versions was the true reality for Pi.   As for my vote - I loved it and then I hated it, but I mostly liked it a lot 
 I had to purchase this book for a cooking class that I had to take. I am by no means a chef and had never even had to cut chicken of a bone. This book was great not only as a text, but as a cookbook with easy instructions that even the most inexperienced chef (like me!) can follow. I highly recommend this book 
 Novels like this are rare, and writers like Charles Bukowski are one in a million. The word "authentic" comes to mind; his writing conveys a raw honesty and much needed non-mainstream point-of-view. Bukowski is the voice of dissent, the marginally employed, creatively frustrated working joe. Like the bird in the cage, his spirit is trapped in a world steeped in bureaucracy and bullsh*t.  Post Office covers Bukowski's 12 years as a postal employee and it follows his difficult working life, which echoes the working life and frustrations of millions. I can't help but think of David Henry Thoreau's famous quote (which applies to Bukowski): "Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them."  Bukowski, in fact, preaches a certain kind of civil disobedience. We're all raised to want the same things: family, material possesions, a house, "respectable" jobs. I think now more than ever, we need Bukowski, we need to challenge the status quo and not buy into a shallow culture of materialism at the cost of trading our souls.  I recommend "Post Office" highly, also his poetry, particularly "You Get So Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense" and "The Last Night Of The Earth Poems." In addition, I recommend "A Working Stiff's Manifesto : A Memoir of Thirty Jobs I Quit, Nine That Fired Me, and Three I Can't Remember"  
 That Queensryche should turn back to the Blues inspired progressive metal that they started with.  Seems to me that Queensryche felt a little pressure from Nirvana amongst others to play less bluesy material, but despite lots of good stuff(and I include 'from the now frontier', 'Tribe' in that list), seems to me that all that post Empire material(including 'Promised Land!') doesn't have the richness and deepness that previous Queensryche records had.  Call me biased, but I've always noticed that if you want to play deep stuff, play the blues.  I remember thinking Joe Satriani's "Surfing with the Alien" was going to be so great; i bought it and Jeff Beck's "Guitar Shop"; i listened to Joe first and tried to think it was so cool; i turned on Jeff Beck's lp second and never bothered with all this neo-classical rock guitar again!    I'm not going to say that Dream theatre isn't any good, or that Tate shouldn't combine his operatic vocals to the Blues like he did back in the day . . . ope, I think I proved my point!  If you listen to Operation Mindcrime one and two, you should notice two things; Operation Mindcrime 1 is bluesy compared to Operation Mindcrime 2, and 2) the second half of Operation Mindcrime 2 is bluesy're and the more emotional ride than the first part of the album.  Queensryche, get back to the blues if you want to play such heavy stuff!  If your trying to play such heavy topics, the Blues is where it's at; the Blues is the deeper higher substance version of rock and roll 
 It's at LEAST worthy of B quality trade paper 
 I had trepidations about this revival.  After hearing this CD, I want to get down to B'way ASAP to see it.  This recording is wonderful.  The few middling spots ("Sing" being the chief offender) are completely outweighed by the most complete recording of the piece, in proper order finally, and the exuberant cast performing a classic score.  Charlotte D'Amboise may not have Donna MacKechnie's pipes, but her stirring rendition of "The Music and the Mirror" is a showstopper.  Jason Tam's few moments of "Oh God I need this job..." are eloquent and subtle (wish we heard more from him on this disc, and they should have included his heartfelt monologue because it is the heart and soul of the show, not to mention that it sets up "What I Did For Love" for the underrated 11 o'clock heartbreaker it's always been).  Natalie Cortez is extremely effective as the feisty Diana, and her "Nothing" is definitely something.  But the entire cast is euphoric in their eagerness to please and present their characters in all their tatters and glories.  This may be considered sacriligeous to some, but this recording is a much better sung recording than the original.  Certainly, training and the expanding skills needed to sustain a musical theater career these days have to account for some of that.  But this cast really sounds excited and committed to reproducing what has to be the classic Broadway musical.  Easily the best new Broadway recording since "Sweeney Todd" (and that's saying something).  Go, go go.  And buy, buy, buy.   It's "One Singular Sensation."  I realize my review will offend devotees of the original recording, but I also think that's one of the best OCRs of all time and have listened to it for 30 years.  Can anyone top Donna MacKechnie?  C'mon, we're all friends where this classic is concerned and let's support it in in every valuable edition so that its life continues.  "A Chorus Line"....just the words are magic.  Thank you Michael Bennett and all of those amazing original cast members for giving so much of their hearts and souls to the the creation of this masterpiece.  And I really do miss the original, though I got to see it 3 times.  Peace 
 This Masterpiece by Dennis kucinich is a must read. in the book he talks about what America is looking for in a president and how he himself can answer the prayers that many Americans are asking for... and that prayer is peace, love, and justice Dennis is all of those. After reading this i wish i had the chance to vote for him in the last democradic election. Things could have been a lot better for us all 
 I have purchased other style books in the past, but this is one of the most useful because it breaks down body types and what looks best. My goal was the dress sexier and more feminine and this books has taught me what types of tops and bottoms to achieve that look. Now that I stick to the rules of thumb they provided, I am more comfortable with wearing whatever I pull out of my closet because I know it will fit great and be stylish. 
 This is the only book I've found that addresses the questions of management, booking, publicity, contract negotiation, budgeting, and market trends for those of us working in classical music.  It's extremely helpful,  clearly written, and comprehensive.  What a relief to get answers to these  questions without having to wade through lots of irrelevent stuff about  club dates and laser light shows!  For once, the tone is right, the  resources cited are appropriate, and the timetables are tailored to the  classical music marketplace.  The author, a former dancer, spends quite a  lot of her time addressing the concerns of touring dance companies, but  there's plenty of information for chamber musicians, theater companies,  touring recitalists, and instrumental and vocal soloists seeking  engagements with orchestras or opera companies.  Now, if there were only a  book like this that focused entirely on the details of creating promotional  materials.. 
 "The Last of The Mohicans" is the second in the Leatherstocking series by America's first professional novelist, James Fenimore Cooper.  Set in upstate New York during the French and Indian War, it introduces the reader to the Eighteenth Century world inhabited by settlers and Indians.  This work contains both continuations and similarities to "The Deerlsayer" (see my Amazon reivew).  The Deerlsayer is now known as Hawkeye and seems to be more a man of action and less a man of words.  Chingachgook remains his loyal friend, although the Indian nature is more presented by his son, Unca.  As in "Deerslayer", much of the story revolves around two sisters, in this case Cora and Alice, who are making their way in the wilderness with the aid of their companions.  Like in "Deerlsayer" the saga finds its action in war and chase scenes involving American settlers and their Indian allies against Indians opposed to them.  This series is rare among early American literature in that the Indians display characters of their own.  A bit of comedy is introduced into the narrative by the character of David Gamut, the professional psalmodist who, despite having gifts so ill-suited to the environment of the story, still manages to play a helpful role in the conflict running throughout the book.  I read this for "mood setting" during a trip to Cooperstown and other areas in which the book is set and in which the author lived.  I was also interested in a familiarity with this classic of American literature.  As a reader of my Amazon reviews is aware, I tend much more toward history than to novels and, generally, enjoy them much more.  That being said, this novel is a keeper.  It is an enjoyable and edifying read, even if classical novels are not your forte.   
 Maggie and her husband Ira are going to the funeral of the husband of Maggie's childhood friend, Serena.  As they travel, their opposite personalities are revealed.  Maggie is a well-meaning "fixer" of situations and people, whose plans often go awry.  Ira is a much more reticent person, who is constantly frustrated by what he sees as his wife's interference in the lives of others.  The funeral they attend is a reunion of many of their old friends and they soon discover that Serena is attempting to recreate her wedding at the ceremony.  When that is behind them they head for home and on the way they have an encounter with an elderly black man.  Their last stop is at the home of Fiona, their former daughter-in-law where, in true Maggie fashion, she tries to patch up Fiona's marriage with their son.  This is a difficult book to rate, because it all seems so hopeless and unchanging.  However, the accurate insights into marriage, relationships, and life are definitely above average, which is why I gave it 4 stars.   
 I read more than 30 books a year and nominate "Beyond Glory" for my Book of the Year for 2005.  David Margolick has produced a wonderfully engaging portrait of a bygone era: a time when heavyweight prizefighting was a BIG social and cultural event (Quick: Who's the world heavyweight champion today? Times have indeed changed.), racial inequality pervaded American society, and the world inched inexorably toward a reckoning with Fascist totalitarianism.  Louis and Schmeling fought two epic bouts.  Margolick captures the intensity of these clashes with the magisterial skill of an accomplished storyteller. He brilliantly recounts Louis's powerful rise through the heavyweight ranks, and the increasing intersection of Schmeling's career with Nazi "master-race" agitprop. Schmeling's Jewish manager was barred from representing him in Germany, but still had no qualms about publicly saluting Hitler after one of his fighter's victories.   One of the treasures of this book is Margolick's frequent reference to contemporary newspaper accounts of the period. The 1930s were the halcyon days of American sports-writing and Margolick's liberal quotations from legendary writers like Grantland Rice, Damon Runyon and many lesser-known scribes enriches his storyline. The flourishing African-American press of the era also provides excellent source material, which Margolick incorporates deftly into his captivating narrative.    "Beyond Glory" is as much a social history as it is a fight chronicle.  You don't have to be a fight fan (I'm not particularly) to reap considerable enjoyment from this fantastic book.  
 This book is Great !! This author has turned this tale of bostonian rioters to a World war of sorts that shook the world, you already know the outcome of of this story yet you feel the suspense, and gripping passages as if it were fiction. And you feel good inside when you see,   "the world was turned upside-down. 
 The tablet was very easy to install and get working with Adobe Photoshop CS2 and Microsoft OneNote.  The tablet settings dialog was intuitive, and I liked the variety of actions that could be assigned to the two top buttons.  The buttons on the pen are handy, but are easy to press accidentally when drawing or holding the pen.  I found the custom context menu option (which I set to the larger of the two buttons on the pen) to be too limiting, so I programmed a replacement for it.  All in all, the Graphire4 is definitely a worthwhile purchase.  I find myself using it even when not working in programs that support digital ink... as a mouse replacement.  For reading large PDF documents or clicking through tons of emails, it's much more comfortable than using the mouse.  The pen pressure sensitivity in Photoshop is also incredible (especially for someone who used to draw things and edit photos with the mouse) 
 Good book, full of helpful information.  Easy read.  I've noticed a difference in my relationship with my daughter already....now if I could only get my husband to use some of their techniques.......... 
 Who writes an autobiography?  Most people who write them are people of note, movers and shakers in their realms and time-periods, people with something to say.  Rarely do we get to read the autobiography of a general loser, someone who is by no measure a good person, and someone completely beyond admiration.  Welcome to Musui's world.  Musui, also know as Katsu Kokichi, was a low-ranking samurai and general good-for-nothing who never thought beyond his immediate needs, and did his best to attain something for nothing when ever possible. He started out bad, as a schoolyard bully who used his status as a samurai to push around lower-ranking kids.  The older he got, the worse he got, and all means to control him or teach him respect failed, including his father locking him in a cage and forcing him to read classic military treatise.  He was eventually adopted off into another family, which brought along with it a bride and a meager salary.  It was never enough to keep up with his habit of visiting prostitutes in the Yoshiwara pleasure districts, so he was soon a leader amongst the black market, working with local extortionists and hoodlums, selling swords and working every possible kind of confidence racket.  Now, everything in this book should be taken with a grain of salt.  Katsu was a grand liar with an enormous ego, who bluffed his way into money and out of trouble on a regular basis.  His tales of his exemplary swordsmanship, his acts of kindness, his ability to drink bottle after bottle of sake without ever getting drunk, smacks as more wish-fulfillment than the true character of an unrepentant rouge.  The translator, Teruko Craig, has added some notes on the accuracy of Katsu's tales, and surprisingly some of the most fantastic adventures are backed up by other sources. I suppose it is up to the reader to determine what is fact and what is fiction.  Teruko Craig has worked a minor miracle with this translation.  Because of Katsu's sketchy literacy, and limited vocabulary, he has had to pull out all the stops in making a readable text that still maintains the flavor of Katsu's way of writing.  The result is a very enjoyable, readable book that brings a nice balance to the world of the samurai.  We have all read of the honor and integrity.  It is nice to have some of the Low along with the High 
 "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" is a play about African Americans migrating north in the 1911. The play takes place in Pittsburgh in a boarding house owned by a husband, Seth, and his wife, Bertha. It is the perfect location for Wilson's theme of separation. This boarding house has several guests and each one has their own philosophy, story, and search. I tried to determine which of those three were most important, but I have come to the conclusion that they are all equally important. Their stories are what link the characters' past to their present. Their respective philosophies explain their outlooks on life and their personalities. The search itself, in my opinion, is for identity - an identity that has been raped by the horrors of slavery. These horrors either directly or indirectly tore the main characters from their loved ones and I think Wilson is arguing that they lost their identities in the process.  It is hard to review a play without giving away any plot. I believe the problem Wilson is trying to overcome is how to recover one's identity. Where does it come from?  The characters in this play are unforgettable - especially the interaction between Bynum and Loomis. The ending is worth reading the play alone - it is so surprising, yet after the initial shock, it makes perfect sense without Wilson elaborating on it.  Highly recommended 
 I can honestly say that these are the only tweezers you will ever need. I have 900 other pairs and when I misplace these, my eyes well up with tears at the thought of losing them. As a freelance makeup artist, I do A LOT of eyebrow grooming. These tweezers are WONDERFUL and VERY precise. I can reach microscopic hairs, that you can only see in a 10X lighted and magnified mirror, with these babies.   These tweezers are also fantastic for splinters, ingrowen hairs, and tackling zits (which you shouldn't be doing . . . tsk tsk).  Be careful! They're sharp 
 I really liked this film.  It's not a groundbreaking movie in any way, though.  It's about a bunch of underdog kids who aren't interested in football until a coach comes along and changes their minds.  Throughout the movie we see the kids working out and trying hard to prepare for the match against the other more talented (and unlikeable) team.   It's pretty much the same thing we've seen in the Mighty Ducks except now it's about football.    It's just a typical family movie that sends the message to children that even if you're small and think you don't have any talent, you actually DO have the talent to play football, hockey, basketball, whatever.  One of the characters is a girl who doesn't know if she wants to play football with the boys or be a cheerleader like all the other girls.    Rick Moranis once again plays that shy, quiet character he does so well in other films such as Honey I Shrunk the Kids.  It's hard to believe he's now a country singer (no, I'm not kidding).  Ed O'Neil doesn't quite play the jerk character you'd expect from the Married with Children show.  He's not really a nice guy either, though.    I find it interesting that the team names are the Giants (the good guys) vs. the Cowboys (the bad guys) because the Monday Night Football game this week were those two teams facing each other (with the Giants winning) 
 There is much I can say about this man's music. Two years ago a friend invited me to see Van Hunt perform at some bar/club in Baltimore, I didn't not know what I was in store for  He and his band put 200% into their performances that night.  Van Hunt sang the entire album and he performed so well, he was humble yet confident.  His skill of performance mirrors Prince to me simply because Prince gives you an excellent performance and so did Van Hunt.  Something special took place that night, because if you didn't know who he was coming in, you were his #1 fan before leaving.  I've been waiting for Van Hunt to come and perform in the Washington, Dc area again, he's a must see.  I know people read these reviews because they want insight on the actual music on the particular CD.  Well from track 1 to track 12 you will not be disappointed at all.  When you hear his music you can relate or at least understand the stories.  He's singing some great stories on this CD and on his latest CD.  Van Hunt should have won some BET, MTV and many other awards.  He is a pioneer with his music and his whole style.  Just from his first CD, everyone should know his name and face, but they don't.  If I could I would treat everyone to this CD because I know you will be blessed.  When I want to relax and reflect on things I pop in a mix CD I made with all the songs from Van Hunt's first CD, about 2 Anthony Hamilton songs, 1 India Aerie, and 2 John Legend, lay back, kick my feet up and listen to some music that soothes my soul.  The only people I can imagine not liking this CD are people who are kind of shallow and can't appreciate music that's deep and meaningful  
 I know the volumes well and I was interested in adding them to my collection. The delivery arrangements were excellent and the price was reasonable.  Thank-you . E.Cobb 
 Those with a cursory acquaintance with the history of government repression of leftist movements will recognize many familiar truths told in this account of the life and murder of Gregorious Lambrakis, a doctor and leftist humanist.    In the movie Lambrakis develops quite a following by articulating quite sensible policies like government budgets shouldn't sacrifice the basic needs of people in order to benefit powerful elites through lucrative defense contracts and that sovereign nations do need to choose sides in the rivalries among superpowers.  Since Lambrakis' message threatens the very foundations of power and privilege, the authorities, as usual, falsely label the movement communist.    After Lambrakis delivers a speech, he is murdered by members of a nationalistic right-wing reaction group that, it turns out, the police often employ for the purposes of "crowd control."  Systems of authority utilizing the forces of reaction are a standard practice to quell justice movements.    One maverick judge (who functions like a prosecutor, investigator and judge) discovers the plot to assassinate Lambrakis extends to persons quite high in the government's hierarchy, although he is frequently encouraged to declare the murder an accident.  Heads begin to roll, but since the trials and convictions threaten the very foundations of power and privilege and portend an electoral victory for the leftists during the next election, the military throws a coup and the judge, witnesses against the defendants and many of Lambrakis' supporters die from a rash of well-timed "accidents" after the coup.  The movie portrays well how authoritarian powers, although using the discourse of "democracy," protect themselves at any cost and will transmute into right-wing dictatorships if threatened with collapse.   
 This is a very interesting look into the life and mind of Mr. Buffett.  I first read it back in 1997.  I found it interesting (and believe it or not, at times riveting) and very easy to read.  Mr. Lowenstein does a great job of describing the life of Mr. Buffett in a way that illustrates the humor, the complexities, the determination of a man who, to the rest of the world, is perceived as being dry, standoffish, and humorless.    I just bought a second copy to give as a gift.  I think in the past 10 years there has been alot of happenings in the financial markets that a revision or addendum is warranted.  
 I happen to be fairly picky, and I don't like a lot of movies.  This, however, is definitely jockeying for position as my #1 all time favorite.  I first saw it ten years ago, during a library movie night that I'd ran with a friend.  We saw a preview for Bitter Moon during another movie and it looked fun so we rented it.  When it ended, the whole audience sat in silence for about two minutes.  We were frankly shocked by the ending...it was absolutely NOT what we had expected.  Bitter Moon is about a couple who go on a cruise to India to celebrate their seventh wedding anniversary. Almost immediately, they meet Mimi, who almost effortlessly weaves a spell around the husband, Nigel, played by Hugh Grant.  He's restless and eager for diversion, a fact that doesn't escape the notice of Oscar, Mimi's wheelchair bound husband.  Almost immediately, Oscar begans to play a game with the besotted husband, offering him Mimi if he'll only listen to their tale first.  And Nigel is immediately sucked into their wild yet desolate and depraved world, with occasionally darkly hilarious and inevitably devastating consequences.  I thought the cast was incredible for this film.  Emanuelle Seigner, playing Mimi, seems to get most of the criticism in the reviews.  Admittedly she's no Meryl Streep but she brings a vulnerability to the role of Mimi, even when the vixen's at her worst.  Hugh Grant is a bit stiff as Niles, but it suits the part well.  Peter Coyote is a sneering fiesta of bitterness and hilarity, and Kristen Scott Thomas steals the show as a wife determined not to be played for a fool.  Make sure the kids aren't around and spare an evening for this one-it's worth it.  
 On the surface this is a spoof of the films made by Roger Corman and other directors who worked in the genre during the same period. There are direct references to "The Pit and the Pendulum" and "The House of Usher" as well as less direct references to films such as "The Raven" and "The Comedy of Terrors". The overall "look" of the film resembles those films and the work that came out of Hammer Studios during the same period but does so without looking like an imitation of them. With its rich textures and lush colours its appearance is never less than striking.  The performances from most of the supporting cast are all way over the top. Scott Atkinson is hilarious in the role of the doctor, Bradley Bradley. Everything he comes out with seems as if it's sucked from his chest and thrown at the camera. The way his accent changes as his role in the proceedings becomes more defined is a brilliant touch. Mary Scheer performs her role as the adulteress as if she were a classic comic book villain, the type whose passion burns most brightly when she's manipulating everyone around her to the max. Elvira's character makes an excellent foil for her. Heather Hopper's portrayal as the sickly Roxanna (part whooping cough, part "Night of the Living Dead" stiff and full time punching bag for the rest of the cast) is a howl. The notion of dubbing in the dialogue spoken by Gabriel Andronache (who reportedly speaks next to no English) was a brilliant one. The first scene between him and Peterson is one for the books. Richard O' Brien has a role that that demands all the pork from Ham Central, and it's one that he appears to have relished playing. The scenes he shares with Peterson appear to have been a joy for both of them.  The excesses of most of the performances are balanced by the understated work from Peterson and Mary Jo Smith. Smith is absolutely adorable as Zou Zou, Elvira's much-abused maid. She plays the role with a combination of dry wit, self-depreciation and vulnerability that can't help but strike a chord. Peterson plays the "Elvira" character with her usual flair. That mix of impish playfulness and canny intellect combined with sweet innocence, brazen sexuality and doltish buffoonery that made the character a cult classic is wholly intact. Her comic timing remains razor sharp.   There's far more to the film though. It goes past the obvious to address (and skewer) a variety of topics. Richard O' Brien's soliloquies put the most overblown passages of Shakespearean Theatre to shame. The dubbing in foreign action films takes a hit or three. The way the use of accents is often bungled by actors and filmmakers is harpooned in a way that's wonderfully original. The "special effects" used for the cataclysmic moment of the film look as if they were intended to be worse than things Ed Wood would've come up with (though it doesn't quite hit that mark). Aging women who cram killer bodies under thick layers of paint (makeup) and thin layers of tight clothing spend parts of the film taking one hit after another.  There's no doubt the reigning Queen of Vamp Camp is showing her age. But she's using it to great advantage. The character seems older. Her sexuality is more overt. She has less patience for playing at being coy. She works too hard to be the centre of attention. She doesn't miss any chances to show her "assets". The camera captures the physical side of things. One of the most revealing of them highlights the ways gravity works on an aging figure regardless of how well it's been taken care of, and it happens early in the film as if to make sure all the viewers take note her of age. Peterson is far too intelligent not to have noticed it but she left it in.   If anyone is the right person to be spoofing the foibles of aging vamps it's Cassandra Peterson. She's old enough to be one of those characters in day-to-day life and she would look great in any of the outfits they pour themselves into. More importantly, she understands any subject matter she touches thoroughly, addresses it without meanness or cynicism and applies a measure of balance to it in the process. She jabs Zou Zou for her looks but makes sure that character is the first to light a fire under somebody's libido. The man with the dubbed-in-lines may look silly because his mouth doesn't match his words but he gets the girl. The aging vamp may fall in holes because she's wearing heels instead of runners the way those vamp wannabees would but the male characters still can't keep their hands off her. It all works because of Peterson's charm and because of the balanced overview she brings to the subject matter.  This is a picture that may find its wider audience in years to come. It's played as camp in a way that may alienate a lot of viewers and there's no doubt a lot of the jokes are lame. But that's all done intentionally. Essentially, it's a good movie that's made to look as if it was bad. Don't be fooled. There's a lot there to stimulate thought and enough light fun to make it easy to keep going back for another look. Today's dog (though it's anything but one) may be one of tomorrow' classics.  Thanks Cassandra. This was worth waiting for 
 This is undoubtedly the best general intro to Judaism that I have come across.  One important advantage of this book is that it covers in detail the views of all three branches of Judaism...Orthodox, Conservative and Reform.  Another popular book on Judaism, Joseph Telushkin's Jewish Literacy is written strictly from an Orthodox perspective and therefore gives a much more limited, unyielding view of the Jewish faith than is really representative based on the overall population  Since around 85% of Jews (according to a recent survey) consider themselves Conservative or Reform, it's very important to get the full views of the different branches before jumping in with Orthodox statements about homosexuality, the ordination of women, or other topics as if these views are shared by all Jews.     This book is organized in an easy question and anwer format and gives enough information without getting bogged down in too much detail on any one topic.  This is the fourth revision since it's original publication in 1953 and reflects recent scholary research and re-appraisals.   
 "An almanac of random, fascinating and utterly unreliable information --  Hodgman has the gift of being outrageously but quietly convincing. He begins at the absolute outer edge of credibility and, as if he is holding your hand, walks you over the edge into a very funny mix of reality and nonsense. Take hobos, for instance -- or as Hodgman refers to it, the "hobo movement in the United States." He discusses at length hobo hieroglyphics, the only hobo Cabinet member in U.S. history and Walker Evans, who Hodgman describes as being a secret agent posing as a photographer in order to assassinate prominent hobo leaders." NPR  John Hodgman tells us that there has only been one murder in the history of the space shuttle. This took place in 1984. The astronaut, the planner, the engineer, the cocktail waitress and the librarian were all suspects. I cannot tell you who did commit the murder, but it is well known.  He discusses hunting and cooking your own polar bear steaks. Julia Child knew this subject well. Also a chapter on Daves Ultra Hot Hot Hot Sauce-which are packaged in little coffins and promises your death. These little known and untrue facts are yours for the asking. These and so many other subjects that would take me all day to discuss are told in amazing detail by John Hodgman.  Each chapter has its own charm, or well, its own place.  This is not a book for children. There are obscene words and stories and facts that children would not understand.  In fact, there were some parts of this book I did not understand, but, all in all, it had me in stitches from one chapter to the next. The author works for television "The Daily Show' and appears on NPR"s "This American Life".  John Hodgman is a graduate of Yale, and is a former literary agent. It appears he was so humorous that he needed to take his humor to an audience who would appreciate him. This book is so amusing you may not be able to read it in one sitting; less you disable yourself from being doubled-over with laughter.  "And while Hodgman may hope as we leaf through the pages, we will gain a better understanding of the world - "perhaps not the world exactly as it is today, but as it may be someday" - one will undoubtedly come away baffled by how such madness can be spun so clear-headedly. Perhaps, though, the only way to truly describe "The Areas of My Expertise" lies in Hodgman's final words: that is all. " Book Review  For those of you who appreciate humour- highly recommended. prisrob 10-21-06 
   I admire the courage of author Terri Jentz and others in her quest for the identification of her "hatchet cowboy". She did the investigation that the community of Redmond,Oregon should have done 29 years ago.  It is chilling to think that her would-be killer is still walking the streets.     
 Every thing he sings is perfect, I've yet to find one song that doesn't move me.  This CD has some beauties.  "Daughter of Mine" is priceless.  "Steal Away" is very nice.  "One Small  Star" brings tears.  This arrangement of "Voyage" is  probably the best I've heard.  His traditional songs ("When you and I  were young Maggie" and "Mary of Argyle") are beautiful.  I  can't find anything on this CD I couldn't listen to for hours.  I truly  love music and listen to it constantly.  I find myself reaching for the  McDermott CD's almost exclusively.  I have them all, more please 
 I liked this entire book, but it starts out slow. I sortof liked it starting out slow because it got me more interested in the book to see if it would get more interesting, and it did. You see they live in London, but something happens that causes them to move.Then, they go to Austrailia. But, to get morre details on this amazing book and adventure, you have to read the book, from front to back. I liked this book because it is unpredictable. Also, it has a lot of different words in it, so it enriches your vocabulary. I would reccomend this book, if you like books that you can't tell what will happen next. Also, if you like books that are an adventure 
 ...I was intrigued by Dr. Cohen's basic premise. The drug industry tries to make drug dosing easy for doctors, but what about the patient? The one size fits all.. dosing is not consumer centric, and in the new age of the informed drug consumer it is about time consumers got their correct dose. Dr. Cohen is... pro-drug treatment for many conditions. He wants to have drug makers offer information and pill sizes for lower dose use. Why should a 250 pound man and 100 pound grandmother get the same starting dose. Yet that is what pharmaceutical companies do in their starting dose recommended. This leads to greater side effects and reduces the use of medicines, says Dr.Cohen. Well-written and easy to understanfd Dr. Cohen raises new opportunities for consumer centric companies interested in making drugs that can be used with less side effects. With poor patient retention and compliance by patients drug companies should be doing what they can to make drug treatment more palatable. Clearly, reducing the over dosing is one way to get greater compliance 
 I read Desperation and enjoyed it immensely much like i did with The Regulators also. This book is filled with suspense from page one. The book never drags in my opinion. This book though is not for the faint of heart. If you don't enjoy high body counts and gore then you will not like this book and will most likely put it down by the second chapter. But if you don't mind it at all like me you will enjoy the suspense he gives you and the twists and turns this book takes. The ending is by far the most suspenseful part. I also recommend reading Desperation first because you will probably understand it better and get a better look on what Tak is all about. The journal entries and newspaper articles are a very nice touch to the story and it lets you understand what is going on alot better also. I wish there was a part three to this but sadly there isn't. I can't choose between Desperation and Regulators because their both great but The Regulators does have the more suspenseful end to it. Although it is alot bloodier and may you even get a brief lump in your throat like i did when a tragic thing happens in the end. Keep up the good work King 
 The Description de l'Egypte is a reproduction of the Napoleonic Egyptian Expedition's work.  The book consists only of plates (with a very brief 3 page introduction) most of which are in black and white although a few are in colour. It contains sections on antiquities, contemporary Egypt (at the time of the expedition), as well as sections on flora, fauna and mineralogy.   There is no commentary on the plates and they are presented without any explanation of their ordering.  This can be disorienting at first but one quickly comes to realize that, for each location, plates describing general details come first and are followed by plates with progressively greater detail. For example, a description of the Isle de Philae begins with a map showing its location, a more detailed map of the island, then several views of the island from different angles and then architectural drawings of the temples on the island. It ends with details of the temple carvings and hieroglyphics.    This book serves as a magnificent addendum to almost any Egyptian history text, providing great depth and detail of illustration of most of the major sites in Egypt. Even illustrated texts (ie. The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt) do not approach the same level of visual detail as the Description.    There are two quibbles about the book's format that lead me to give the book 4 stars instead of 5.  The first is that the book is too small.  It is a paperback with 1008 pages, and not a very large paperback at that.  This book would have been truly great (albeit much more expensive) if it had been a full-size hardcover.  The second detail is that the plate captions are untranslated.  This may be a concern to you if you do not speak French.  Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Egyptian history or archeology.  It might also be an interesting tool for those interested in architecture or design, given its attention to fine details of early Egyptian constructions.             
 Saw this lad on NBC, bought a ticket to his live perfomance the next night in Phila, and purchased his import album the next day.  It's hard to believe Paolo is only 19.  He is going to make the ladies melt with his raspy solos and perfect falsettos!!  You will love his bluesy rhythms and relate to heartfelt lyrics! 
 If you're interested in the life of Ayn Rand read this book, and then Nathaniel Branden's "My Years With Ayn Rand."  Yes, both these books show Ayn Rand failing to live up to her own ideals, but don't we all fail that test?  Rand's genius was in formulating ideas and putting them down in a powerfully lucid form, not in setting a personal example.  I can't say having read Barbara's and Nathaniel's books has affected my view of Rand's Objectivist philosophy--and why should it?  A good idea is a good idea, no matter what the faults of it's author.    As for the authors, both Barbara's and Nathaniel's books are first rate.  While I can't vouch for the accuracy of the details, they seem to ring true.  While Barbara's was a true biography, Nathaniel's was his tell-all of his long-running affair with Rand. This difference in perspective allows the books to compliment one another.  Even after many years I still can't decide which one was better.   
 Not being from the South, and only regularly watching Nascar beginning in 1997, my opinions may not quite be as objective or fact vs. fiction as others.   The movie gives us a look into the legendary NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt.  Starting with his upbringing in a small mill town by a tough as nails father who dies in his prime, Ralph, who races the dirt tracks.  It was rumored that noone could ever beat Ralph when he raced.  The story gives us an insight into Dales life up to his tragic Death on the track, while along the way showing us all the people who were a part of his life and a part of what made him be who he was.  From his father, to other racers, his wives and kids, and his special friendship with another driver who perished on the track, Neil Bonnet.  It also shows his reaqaintance with his first son, Cary.  Dale is perplexed to learn that Cary also worked in the same mill that his dad and him worked in, making Cary a 3rd generation mill worker.  It also has a great depiction of Dale Jr., how his stubborness as a teenager is met with a wall of eqaulity from his father, and how the two ended up racing together in the end.  Barry Pepper does an excellent job, I feel, of playing the role of the great racer.  The cast was done superbly for this movie and given their limited budget, I have to give ESPN a "2 thumbs up" for their effort in bringing us a great story about a great individual of our time.  I always had the assumption Dale was a bit of a jerk, a grump, well this movie not only proved that wrong but showed me that the whole track can be filled with grumps when it comes to racing for the next dollar or meal.  Dale Waltrip is portrayed as an arrogant instigator to Earnhardt early in his career.  The second to last scene in the movie leaves us breathless as it shows the 4th turn on the final lap of the Daytona 500 that would ultimately be Dale's last race.  The final scene in the movie, outside of the mill, was very fitting, I won't give it away so watch it!    
 THE BOOK HELD MY INTEREST FROM START TO FINISH. IT OPENED MY EYES TO THE POSSIBILITIES OF MY FUTURE AND HELPED ME TO RECOGNIZE THE INCREDIBLE "COINCIDENTS" THAT HAVE SHAPED MY LIFE. NOW I AM SENSITIVE TO EVENTS IN A NEW WAY. MY LIFE IS RICHER FOR IT. I LOVED THE BOOK AND ENJOY RE-READING IT BY OPENING THE BOOK AND READING A PAGE AT RANDOM. I KEEP FINDING NEW THINGS IN IT 
 I purchased one for each of the kids that still live with mom and dad! I like the way it draws the kids to dig deeper. That is when they grab one the Thompson Chains I have all over the house! Tyndale has done a good job with Bible construction, this is a substantial Bible 
 I run a tree maintenance firm in my hometown.  I have begun to deal in turfcare, since trees and turf are generally at odds with each other in the urban landscape.  This book reflects my own philosophy of "take care of the soil and the soil will take care of the rest".  It only falls short in that tree care is not mentioned at all, and to truly maintain an organic balance, both lawn and woody ornamental plants should be considered in as equal parts in a plant health care program 
 Reading these stories of the different ways the Blessed Mother has touched other's lives made me feel good.   Some were just normal everyday experiences, others were quite inspiring.  I read a bit each night and kept looking forward to the next story.  I have shared the book with a number of people.... 
 I had only read "Emma" once several years ago so I don't remember all the details that one finds lacking in film adaptations.  But I must say that I am very pleased with this adaptation of the book.  I bought this movie on a whim last week---really knowing nothing about it.  I really enjoyed the enitre movie from start to finish and have watched it several times since.    I think it is a "cute" story and Paltrow/Northam play a very likeable Emma/Knightley. Seeing this movie has motivated me to reread the book and although I'm not yet halfway through the book, I do find that quite a bit of the dialogue from the book is found in the movie and in general it follows the book pretty well.    This is an easy to watch, feel good, romantic movie.  I liked all the characters, esp Sophie Thompson as Miss Bates.  Certainly a great movie to watch on dreary days to lift your spirits.  I would highly recommend this to any romantics at heart.  
 Robben Ford is one of the more underrated guitarists out there.  "Mystic Mile" shows the band's versatility.  Although I prefer "A Handful of Blues", I recomend this CD for the just the first track alone.  "He Don't Play Nothin' But the Blues" is as good a rock song as there is, and Ford's playing and strong vocals ring through 
 Excellent movie with Elvis Presley. The singing is awesome. Nice love story and beautiful scenery to showcase Hawaii 
 This is my FAVORITE book by Iyanla Vanzant because of:  It's size(small enough for your tiny purse), its lack of preach-i-ness and how the index is organized by subject. I feel its a synopsis of all the subjects covered in her other books.  I also feel the book is applicable to women of ALL cultures.  You can use it as a daily guide or you can use the index to find a subject for which you could use guidance 
 Works just like advertised....although, I would recommend a higher lumines...is a bit faded when wathcing during daylight with curtains drawn.  I did buy a extra-large window shade ($20) for a screen and works perfectly! I see no need to purchase some $150-$200 special screen 
 This is my second purchase, the first was a christmas gift for my 2 yr old niece who lives in the UK.  She absolutely adores it, and of the virtual "Toys R Us" environment she lives in, this is one of her favorite toys.  It's so popular that this second purchase is a birthday gift for one of her playmates 
 It's rare to find a book that provides such depth yet is at the same time highly readable and even humorous.  A must-read for anyone looking to conduct customer service surveys 
 After recently seeing the award-winning film Capote, I made a conscious decision that I simply needed to read more of Capote's work. Philip Seymour Hoffman was absolutely brilliant as the tortured writer, and he made me realise that there was a lot more to Capote than  In Cold Blood.    I read  ICB  in high school at a time when I was full of teenage conspiracy theories and thrived on books like  Helter Skelter.  Needless to say I was absolutely fascinated by Capote's investigation and obsession of a rural multiple murder that rocked America. However, after reading Capote's 'one great book,' I failed to read anything else by him.  Published in 1958, eight years before  ICB, Breakfast at Tiffany's: A Short Novel and Three Stories  is comprised of the main work as well as the less famous shorts "House of Flowers," "A Diamond Guitar" and "A Christmas Memory." Ashamedly, I have never seen the film version with Audrey Hepburn playing the lead role of Holly Golighty but, due to the sheer infamy of the film, as well as Hepburn's face adorning the front cover of the book, I couldn't have pictured the protagonist as anyone else.  Set in 1940s New York City, the book is narrated by an unnamed male writer (whom Golighty nicknames Fred after her estranged brother) who forges a friendship with society gal Holly Golighty whilst they are living in the same brownstone. As he descibes her antics, the narrator's naï¿½veity is quickly erased by Golighty's bold, brazen lifestyle of men, martinis and money. The social attitudes that Capote expresses in the novel are way ahead of their time. In fact, certain details and ideas that must have been scandalous then still manage to maintain their shock factor 50 years on.  Although the writer's character in the film (played by George Peppard) is named Paul 'Fred' Varjak, the narration has an autobiographical feel to it. I drew many parallels between the narrator of the book and Capote himself (his childlike innocence, his escape to the big city, etc.) which caused me to envision Capote beside Hepburn's Golighty.  Although just over 100 pages,  Breakfast at Tiffany's  feels like an epic in terms of the strength and vividness of the main character. Holly Golighty literally jumps off the page. Like Scarlett O'Hara, she is a literary heroine of the 20th century and Capote's ability to bring her story full-circle in so few pages is truly amazing.  The shorts are very strong, as well, particularly "House of Flowers," which is set in Haiti and proves that Capote is just as comfortable writing in a relatively foreign setting as he is in his natural habitat.

 Okay, you all know this movie. You all know the story. And you all know how bizarre the film storyboards.  A man time travels between insane asylum, past, and future...His sole purpose is to be the pawn used by a future society determined to allow a disease to descimate the planet, and ensure their power in the future.As with Gillam's film Brazil (brilliant), it is a statement about the rigid and inflexable structures of society.   This is, in my opinion, the best performance of three major stars.   Bruce Willis-his first `bald' movie (ah...the hairline to come!) I am a huge Bruce fan. But this is really one of the best performances he has ever done. His emotions of confusion are honest. My honest opinion is this was better than any of his movies. He UNDERPLAYS his character perfectly.   Terry Gillam director-Better than Brazil, which I thought was a brilliant film. His detail of time travel and lunacy is palatable. It FEELS real. His characters (like most of his films) are bombastic beyond real. I only wish he had been able to finish his version of Man Of La Mancha...  Brad Pitt-This is the best I have ever seen of this pretty boy. His quirky near tourettes mannerisms are fantastic. Right down to the finger flicking/facial contortion and non-sequeteur dialogue. Way better than Fight Club. This is a personae he never played again. Too bad. He plays a fantastic lunatic better than he plays a spy, a hit man, or a romantic lead.   I do not expect this to get votes. I just wanted to put in my 2 cents 
 I found this history of the NFL very interesting. Many who follow the NFL know the importance of the '58 championship game. The Author sets up the background leading up to that game, including the original NFL clubs and the upstart AAFC (all-american football conference - original home of Browns and 49ers). There are scores of fascinating personalities - commissioners, owners and players. The author makes it clear how important the three commissioners, Tagliube, Rozelle and Bell were. He looks at a lot of different factors that lead to the ascension of the NFL to the top of the American sports heap, including the revenue sharing decisions, TV, Monday Night Football, and the desire for "parity". If you are at all interested in the history of the leaque, I highly recommend this book 
 This story really started out with a bang.  Fran is finally leaving her abusive husband  Bobby, and very much like the movie "sleeping with the enemy" it is time to relocate and start a new , different life.  Fran brings along her son in an effort to protect them both, and the story line there is a sad and sometimes intense one, as would be expected when you rip a boy form his father's life.  Fran faces the usual challenges of forming a new life, plus the added stress of staying hidden from her past.  The stroy is interesting, I will give Quindlen that, and I was impressed by her portryal of Bobby- so believable and frightening at times, but her writing style is not my favorite, and at could be a bit  cliche in parts of the book, thus the 4 stars.    If you liked the movie mentioned, or similiar "Lifetime" stlye stories this will be a good one to add to your list.  Not a hard read, maybe felt a bit long at some places, but the story is good enought to keep you invlolved.  Definitely worth it's 4 star rating 
 We are very excited about this projector. right off the box ! anyone looking into hd tv's should consider this - the image is as big as we could ever want it to be - and with an HD TV feed - picture is crazy  
  "Whew! It is never over. This book has been a pustule on our rear for so long. I will never write a third edition - you can bet the estate on it. So yes, David, you can be the first author of the third edition. ...."  So begins the introduction by Robert Grossman to this second edition of "Neuroradiology: The Requisites".  It is a bit strange to see so many bad jokes and bad poems and such blunt Asperger syndrome-type language in what should be a dry and scholarly textbook for serious professionals, but at least the book is never boring. RIG and DMY manage to skewer surgeons, lawyers, HMOs, FMGs, other radiologists, their wives, each other, and most of all, Bill and Hilary Clinton, while educating us all about the essence of Neuroradiology. Strangely enough, the words "George Bush" are completely absent from this book - one wonders because the authors work hard to be equal opportunity jokesters, and DMY states in the book that he is a liberal Democrat. But then, remember that this book was finished right around the time that the War in Iraq Part Deux was getting started, a time when people were getting death threats just for even wondering out loud - "Gee what if Saddam doesn't have any WMDs?" I do get a distinct feeling that both these guys were probably in favor of regime change in Iraq in any case.  (For all you young, liberal Democrat, whippersnapper Radiology residents out there, basking in your multiple job offers, let me explain that Bill and Hilary will forever live in a very hot and dark place in the memories of older Radiologists for creating the last big Down cycle in our field, the Great Job Depression of 1994-1998. In one of his first major policy speeches on health care reform, Bill Clinton singled out the MRI scanner as a prime example of how expensive and wasteful healthcare in the US had become. Subsequently, the volume of MRI scans nationwide shot downward, MR centers closed right and left, and radiology jobs disappeared. In the fall of 1995, there were only four full time radiology job openings in the entire state of California advertised in the ACR Professional Bureau.............Never Forget! Never Forgive!)   This book is more than enough for the Radiology resident studying to take the Radiology Boards. That's what it was designed for.  It is also a great book for the old farts in private practice to review and get updated on the latest stuff.  Being an old fart in private practice, I read this book to study for the Maintenance of Certificate (MOC) exam for the Neuroradiology CAQ. I passed, but I'm pretty sure they graded on a curve, because that was one heck of a hard test, way harder than the original Neuro CAQ. Good thing I also scanned through Ann Osborne's "Diagnostic Imaging: Brain"; plus I paged through Som and Curtin's two volume "Head and Neck Imaging" book on CD. Both texts were also useful for the MOC.  Ah, what the heck, they probably passed everybody .......don't let me scare you, go ahead and take the MOC....  The only criticism that I have for this book is that a few of the illustrations are just awful, really poor transfers from the original. The authors do acknowledge this problem in the introduction. Plus, for some interesting entities there are no images, whereas for some relatively common things (at least in private practice, possibly these are extremely rare in academia?) like synovial cysts of the lumbar spine, there are, what, some FIFTEEN images?! Like, I have NEVER seen a synovial cyst before, please show me more examples!  But then again, there were a series of questions about synovial cysts of the lumbar spine on the MOC exam.   So, kudos, for a job well done! 
 Toad The Wet Sprocket were riding at their peak when this concert took place. "Fear" became their biggest seller and the top forty welcomed "All I Want" and "Walk On The Ocean." This being a homecoming concert, both the band and their Santa Barbara fans were stoked, and the show comes off as a hero's welcome.  The band has always been underrated, and the compositions here (from the first three albums) show a lot of strength. Glen Phillips' gifts as a song-writer have never been truly recognized. While he (and the band, who co-wrote the majority of the material) did cultivate a folkish and, even at a certain level, mellow sound, there is a dark streak to many of their best songs. "One Little Girl" and "Hold Her Down" are unflinching takes on abuse, while "I Will Not Take These Things For Granted" may be the most beautiful song to never hit the top-40. They were also not shy from experimenting, as "Butterflies" shows. (Love the Beatles quote at the end!)  All in all, "Welcome Home: Live" shows Toad The Wet Sprocket in full gale as a band. A band that toughed it out through years on the road and a couple of poorly selling albums to develop the chemistry and the tenacity that they were still there when the lucky break occurred. Along with the "P.S." best of collection, this CD is a terrific representation of the band at their toadiest. Incidentally, Phillip's post-toad solo work is quite good. Check it out 
 Marcus Didius Falco is not, despite his claims, visiting Ostia for pleasure, but to track down Infamia, whose scandalous column in the Daily Gazette gets him in trouble more often than not. He said he was going to visit an Aunt in Ostia, but he never returned and the only thing he leaves behind him are some personal effects and a trail of several odd clues.   For instance, shortly before his disappearance, he attempted to take on various different jobs, even applied to the Vigiles. One of the last people to see him is a reclusive old sea merchant who claims, despite rumors otherwise, to have never been a pirate...piracy being one of the things that, officially, no longer exists.   This sixteenth book following the adventures of Falco has several interesting twists. An informer (private eye) of some renown, he, along with his best friend Petronis and his love Helena find themselves in an increasingly dangerous situation, filled with Cicilain pirates, kidnapping and murder.   The series is famous for its rich depiction of Ancient Rome and each one seems to focus on a slightly different area of the culture and history, teaching us a great deal. This time, as you may have gathered, it's piracy.   It was interesting to see how the pirates were used by the Roman government, then declared completely stamped out, though, unofficially, everyone knew it was still going on. Also, the rules that these pirates abided by to make sure that their victim's families paid up showed them to be shrewd businessmen as well as criminals.   
 I too was blown away by Howie's one man bandness at a Tori Amos show. Of all the singer/songwriters whose emergence have coincided with the newly refound brilliance of Nick Drake, Howie is the only one that doesn't come off as taking himself too seriously. His talent is unintentional and does not seem to be scripted. Plus he doesn't seem to be permanently stoned.. 
 I don't know what it is about this book in the series, but I have to say it was my top favorite. Maybe it was the Holloween theme, I don't know. The whole series is highly recomended.

 Simply Awesome! I keep having to stop the tape so it can sink in 
 I recomend this book to every new mom. It explains everything that is happening and I knew what to expect before I went to my Dr's appointment. It told me things my doctor didn't. 
 This was a gift for my mother and she loved it. She especially liked the stand the mixer sits in. And boy does it have power.  GREAT! 
 This is the best comedy of all time.  I have watched hundreds of comedies, but this is the only one that I am able to watch over and over again.  Every time I watch this movie, I notice something funny that I did not see before.  This is well worth your time and money.  The acting is superb and the script is full of originality and classic one liners.  Look for a young kevin bacon in his first major role.  Also observe that John vernon is playing in a comedy role.  John vernon plays the college dean, but he also plays the mayor in the movie "dirty harry" and if you see both movies there is quite a contrast. This is just a wonderful movie.  Here is a bit of trivia for you... John Belushi was the highest paid actor when this movie was made (he earned a mere $200,000).  This movie is great.  Simply wonderful 
 I havent completely read the book, but whatever i have gone through certainly seems good plus the questions on the CD and the broad coverage of different areas make it a good resource for CISSP pre 
 this book teaches us to & how to focus on the positive aspects of our consciousness. There are way too many sidetracks & distractions in modern life to 'right thinking'...this work is an aid to avoiding them 
 This was the first Wayne Dyer book I read, and caused me to have a thirst for more of Wayne's depth. This is a very short and easy to read book, and can be transforming if one is ready to make changes in thought. Always a five star in my book, and one to reread occasionally just to keep my thoughts in line and appreciate all that there is for us in life. 
 There's a peculiarly boring film version of this, made in the 1960s, which is interesting only because it features the English novelist Martin Amis, then a fetching blond teenager, in a supporting role. Good books often make bad films, and this is a very good book indeed. Richard Hughes had never been to Jamaica when he wrote this remarkably vivid story about a colonial family in the nineteenth century. Jamaica, as Hughes describes it, is a wild and lush paradise for the Bas-Thornton children - but a paradise from which they are soon to be expelled. After a hurricane devastates the island, their parents decide that the five children (Martin's one of them, in the movie) must be sent back to England. But they have not got far before their ship is attacked by pirates, and the children are kidnapped. The ordeal which follows is a dramatic and unexpected one - for the children, led by the tomboyish Emily, are more than a match for the brutal Captain Jonsen and his crew. Not a children's book as such, but a novel about childhood, this powerful adventure story has been compared to William Golding's Lord of the Flies (1954). The vivid, laconic style is a considerable achievement - and the ending, especially the last sentence, is one of the wonders of literature 
 (by the way, just in case your not sure, Lynchian means like something David Lynch would Direct.) I have heard many people bag this movie, saying it doesn't make sence and it's too hard to follow. So I was glad to see  these other reveiwers who felt as i did about this very unique movie. Tim  Roth does his Best acting since Reservoir dogs in this rivorting thriller.  I won't say anything about plot because its all to hard to put in words,  but i will say this. Anyone who likes it, see the film "LOST  HIGHWAY" 
 Delillo would get better, but those later novels prove that these early novels weren't some kind of weird writing fluke, while the novels from this period prove that he didn't exactly come out of nowhere.  All of the classic elements of Delillo are already in place, the razor sharp prose that forms intricate and effortless rhythms where you think the words were always supposed to fall together that way, while the dialogue snaps back and forth like a live wire, even when the characters are talking languidly, and the characters themselves, both sharply defined and vaguely drawn, studies in contrasts.  The plot here has something to do with language and a cult that is killing people for reasons that might have to do with language, while "risk analyist" James Axton ponders being separated from his wife and what all this travelling really means.  What does it mean?  It means the reader get a very meditative novel, carried along mostly by shifting from character study to character study, from observation to observation.  For the most part it's a joy just watching everyone interact, the cult plot for the most part never becomes more than secondary and in fact most of the plot is secondary, you get more of a sense that you're peeking in on the lives of real (and very flawed) people.  If Delillo wasn't such a master at crafting prose then all of this would come across as highly boring but he can make the descriptions of even the most static scenes and the most mundane thoughts crackle with a strange kind of energy, where behind the flat events sparks a vital sort of life.  Probably more experienced than actually read, and not something for people who are expecting an exotic suspense thriller along the lines of what's currently in the movies (though it is exotic and you do get a good feel for the countries that are visited) it's for those who admire charactization and insightful prose over deft plotting . . . Delillo would sharpen all of these traits even further later on but if you want to see where it all came from and how it all started, this novel is one of the places to begin to look 
 I picked up the first Stephanie Plum novel out of curiousity and wasn't disappointed.  I've gone on to read every book in the series and have enjoyed every one.  Rarely does a book have me laughing out loud, but I do with each one of these.  The characters are wonderful.  Grandma Mazur is great.  She may be old, but she doesn't let that stop her.  She'll try anything, anytime.  I love Ranger and Joe.  If I had two guys like that in my life, I'd have a hard time deciding between them too.  I love the family dinners.  The conversations are hilarious.  You can picture Stephanie's dad trying so hard to tune everyone out and not quite succeeding.  And Lula!  She gets better with every book.  Sure the situations and the characters can be a little out there at times, but isn't that what makes a great book?  I love to get lost in a good book and tune out everything around me.  I'm starting the 11th book next, I already have #12 and can't wait for the 13th to come out.  I recommend this series to everyone.  Give it a chance and read it for what it's supposed to be, escapism.  There's too little of that these days and I think we all need it to some point in our lives

 This is good book and is well researched.  It gives balanced exposition to both the optimists and pessimists in their takes on oil depletion and the peak oil phenomenon.  I already believe that the pessimists are right - our civilization is in for a very rough ride that will begin in the very near future.  So, I think the balance Roberts provides does not give the impending crisis the gravity it deserves.  The author is being a good journalist by presenting the alternative energy possibilities as potential ways to soften the blow of an oil crunch, but I think alarm bells should be going off.  Kunstler's The Long Emergency does a better job of scaring the hell out of you - and rightly so 
 To read the synopsis on the back of the box, you'd assume this is just another fluffy romantic comedy.  Did the writer even watch the movie?  While it does have its comic and romantic moments it's basically a serious look at the residents of a British mining community and the stress and despair faced by families and community as their source of livelihood, the mine, faces closure.  The story follows the one remaining ray of community pride as the miner's Colliery band competes for a shot at the championship in London.  It also follows the political and management process of choosing efficiency and profit over the welfare of the miners.   The entire film is well acted, the music is outstanding and the story is at once heart-breaking and heart-warming.  A wonderful movie!

 This handbook is unlike any other nature guide, instead of the usual book which is limited to a single aspect of nature, Ernest Williams has collected 227 descriptions of his observations in the field over the past several decades. The topics are wide ranging, with five general themes: relationship of size and shape, adaptations, distributional patterns, behavior and diverstiy of life. It is organized in three chapters: plants, animals and habitats. The topics are interesting little morsels, 1-2 pages each, illustrated by 500 excellent photos. It makes great bedside or bathroom reading! But I read most of the book on a day of travel. This will be a great addition to any nature observer's library 
 WOW.... thank you Mike Mason!  My fiance and I are reading this book together during our long-distance engagement and find that the insights are thoroughly enriching to our relationship.  This book deals with the spiritual picture of marriage, absolutely no practical "do's and don'ts" here.  There are no "how to's" or guidelines for having a successful marriage... and honestly, such information seems so surface compared to the richness and wealth offered by this book.  Understanding and applying the truths presented here almost guarantees a joyful and harmonious marriage.  the mystery of marriage unveils the bedrock of marriage and then causes it to glow!  I look forward to reading this book out loud with my wonderful husband in the many delightful years to come.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
 Peach: Ty Cobb In His Time And Ours is a coffee table biography of one of baseball's greatest players, who hit .367 over 24 seasons (1905-1928), won a dozen batting titles, and was the first man elected to baseball's Hall of Fame. Ty Cobb was well known for his intense and changeable personality, rivalries, and petty jealousies; but author Richard Bak reveals a side of Ty Cobb less discussed... a man who came to the aid of down-and-out ballplayers, founded a hospital system and educational foundation which remain successful after a half-century, and who came to terms with his own tarnished legend. Published to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Ty Cobb's baseball debut, and featuring over 150 rarely seen black-and-white photographs, Peach: Ty Cobb In His Time And Ours is a slice of unforgettable sports history and a "must-have" for fans of great baseball figures throughout history. 
 Based on the general insights of two research psychologists that wrote A Course In Miracles about 1976, this book (DU) has made a fun read out of some difficult concepts and is akin to "taking the cod liver oil with the orange juice". A a 'metaphysical junkie' for over 35 years, I can't sing enough praises about this book. It is definitely not for the highly opinionated reader but is highly beneficial for the 'true searcher' who wants to explore all options about the meaning of life and wants to "think out of the box". I am on my 3rd reading. 
 I finished reading Patrick Rothfuss's The Name of the Wind yesterday, and after a mere 2 hours or so picked it up and started reading it again.  Now why in the world would I do this?  I asked myself that question a few times and my answer is:  * It's damn good writing.      The language Rothfuss uses is beautiful, absolutely beautiful.  I found myself rereading sections simply because they were so delightfully and beautifully written.  He has a poetical turn of phrase, and there are passages that simply sing.  * But it's also a riveting story.      The story pulled me in, immersing me in Kvothe's world so much that I half expected to see the scrael scuttling through my backyard (a truly terrifying thought for anyone who hates spiders as passionately as I do).  * And the characters are absolutely believable.      Kvothe is a living and breathing character who practically leaps off the page--unruly red hair and eyes bright green like new growth grass.  He is absolutely believable, especially to anyone who remembers being a boy and the awkwardness that comes with growing up.  I guess that's three answers.  Anyway, run out and grab this book.  Grab two.  It's that good

 Kickboxer came out a year after the highly popular "Bloodsport" and like Bloodsport, Kickboxer is no doubt a "Van Damme classic".  There are plenty of fights and lots of good training sequences, however the acting suffers - worse than Bloodsport in that department.  As for the plot - revenge - go figure.  But we don't need good acting and plot to enjoy this movie.  Hey, it came to the point a good american martial art movie strives off of bad acting and weak plots so you can focus more on the action.  Fortunately, Kickboxer delivers it well.  The movie begins with a couple of good fights right away.  About 1/2 of the movie is training sequences, but many are enjoyable to watch.  The final fight is between the villain, Tong Po (played by Michel Qissi) and Kurt Sloane (Van Damme).  Its a rather lenghty fight, about 10 minutes, which is nice.  Above all else, they fight with hands wrapped in rope with broken glass glued on, and yes the result is some blood during the fighting.  Kickboxer is the only martial art movie I know of that used this "ancient Thai style of fighting" (with the exception of Kickboxer 2 and a small scene in Ring of Fire).  I really enjoyed this.  I also enjoyed Michel Qissi.  He had maybe one line in the movie, but still succeeded in making Tong Po a great villain, who also will return in the sequal.  Lastly, we can't forget to mention the Van Damme dance - Napoleon Dynamite would be proud.  Also keep an eye out for Ong Soon Han (main villain in both Bloodsport 2 and Dragon:The Bruce Lee Story), who has a short fight against Tong Po about 1/2 way through the movie 
 Sylvester and the Magic Pebble is William Steig's third book and the only book Steig wrote and illustrated that won the Caldecott Medal.  This story is about a donkey named Sylvester Duncan and his family.  Sylvester lives with his parents on Acorn Road in Oatsdale.  One of Sylvester's hobbies is collecting pebbles of unusual shapes and colors.  One rainy day Sylvester finds a red pebble that will grant him wishes.  On his way home to show the pebble to his parents a lion frightens him at Strawberry Hill.  To save himself he wishes he were a stone.  His problem was he could not wish himself back because the red pebble was not touching him because he was a rock with no hands.  A year passed and his family thought that they would never find their darling child, until one day on a picnic at Strawberry Hill.  His parents eat on the very stone, which is Sylvester.  His dad picks up the red pebble and wishes his son was with them.  The dad puts the red pebble on the stone and Sylvester wishes that they were back together and at that moment he is a donkey again. The family puts the rock away to wait until they really need something again.        Steig addresses the theme of children's fears of separation from their parents, as well as their fears and terrors and even wishes for radical transformations.  Steig uses realistic fiction and animal fantasy in this book.  This is true because the book is about animals doing human like things, which is Animal Fantasy.  The fact that Sylvester finds a magic pebble and turns into a stone is fantasy.  At the same time, if you think of the characters as people, this story could really have happened, as far as people do have families, they have picnics, and children get separated from their parents.  I consider Sylvester and the Magic Pebble a good book.  Books for younger children usually focus on one or two main characters, cover short time sequences, and most often are set in one place.  Sylvester and the Magic Pebble has one main character, Sylvester, and it is set in two places, Acorn Road and Strawberry Hill.  The time sequence is also very short.  Even though the book spaced over a year, the time went by quickly.  Sylvester was a rock for each season and each page of the book had a new season, therefore he was soon reunited with his family.  Sylvester is also supposed to be the age of a child, therefore a child that reads this book will be able to identify with the central character.  This too is an example of a good book.  The language is concrete and vivid and not overly complex.  This story primarily names characters and their actions, nothing too hard for a child to put together.  This book allows the reader to put themselves in Sylvester's shoes, so they can have empathy for what it must be like to be separated from your family by accident.  This book does not overly teach a moral and is mostly an enjoyable read.  Once Sylvester's parents find him, they do not even want to use the magic pebble anymore, because they want nothing more then their son.  This shows that the book has truth to it with the human experience of realizing what you have once you have lost it.  The illustrations are equally as appealing as the text itself.  I love how William Steig is the author and illustrator in all his books.  Overall, the genre, plot, language, characters, style, theme, and illustrations all come together to make a satisfying whole, therefore I would absolutely consider Sylvester and the Magic Pebble a good book.  This book would be great to read in the classroom.  I thought of several teaching connections.  The book talks about a donkey that collects pebbles. You could talk to the class about collections and encourage them to share about ones they have or start a collection for the class.  Talking about different pebbles also allows for you to talk about the different kinds of rocks and gem stones. This is a great science lesson that you could even take a field trip to a gem mine and see what types of gems the students could find.  You could also use this book in talking about animals. This book does not show the typical animal actions, but you could talk about how the animals in the book are trying to act more like humans and explain these differences.  You could also do an art lesson, where students would find a large pebble and as a class everyone could paint pebbles.  You could also teach children how colors mix to make different colors during this lesson. 
 This book is an excellant source of palette development, pigment uses and development as well as color theories throughout history.  My students have worn out my copy -- needs to be reprinted and made known in college art  departments. Good, solid informational writing and illustrations.  A  must-have book for artists and students. D. Swaim, Prof., M.C.C., Arizon 
 I am very happy with the product and the time period it was delivered in. Very happy with the seller and would do business with them again. 
 I had a Head TI S6 racquet and it wasn't enough for me( not enough control with it). I did a loner from my local sporting goods store an loved this racquet.  I'm a 3.0-3.5 player, the feel and the control of this racquet is ten times better than my other racquet. Great racquet! 
 WALDEN has rarely been out-of-print since its first publication in 1854.  Copies come in all sizes, shapes and price ranges.  Today's Thoreauvians have three ANNOTATED versions of WALDEN to choose from.  Each one provides same-page explanatory notes that help the reader interpret the sometimes esoteric references in Henry David Thoreau's original text.  The three books are "The Annotated Walden" (edited by Philip Van Doren Stern, 1970), "Walden: An Annotated Edition" (edited by Walter Harding, 1995), and "Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition" (edited by Jeffrey S. Cramer, 2004).  Each one has at least one map of Concord and/or Walden Pond.  Each one has its strengths and weaknesses. Each one has appeal for a devoted audience.  "Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition" by Jeffrey S. Cramer was released in August 2004, coinciding with the 150th anniversary of the original publication date.  Cramer is the curator of collections for The Thoreau Institute and therefore has access to some of the best primary and secondary source material available -- including Walter Harding's notes.  In addition to the text of WALDEN, this volume includes a few "extras": an introduction to Thoreau's life but only as it applies to his cabin stay and WALDEN writing; a bibliography; notes on the text; and a detailed index.   The explanatory notes -- the essence of an annotated edition -- are quite extensive.  They are set off from the WALDEN text with page-within-a-page graphic detailing and are easy to read.  Cramer did not merely merge Van Doren Stern's and Harding's previous notes with those from David Gorman Rohman's dissertation.  His analysis at times echoes that of Harding, but when it does, Cramer often goes one step further with a definition or citation.  He has thoughtfully used a "Notes on the Text" appendix to outline HDT's wording differences in the various drafts of the work.  Thus his annotations are not bogged down by minor editorial alterations that the casual reader may not care about.  Unlike Harding, Cramer refrains from expressing personal opinions and lets the research speak for itself. An added bonus is a reproduction of Edward Emerson's map of Walden Pond which shows the location of Thoreau's bean-field as Waldo's son remembered it.  The only cumbersome quality in this publication is the placement of WALDEN chapter titles at the bottom of the pages instead of the top.  This otherwise stellar volume is beautifully presented with a cover photo of the cabin reproduction as it currently stands in Walden Pond State Recreation Area. A classy edition by all accounts.  Lining up the three versions side by side is an interesting experiment, best conducted on a rainy summer day when no other work has appeal.  Let's use two well-known and oft-debated passages for an initial sample interpretive comparison.  "I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on their trail."  ("Economy") Do those three animals stand for actual individuals in Thoreau's life?  Or does this passage simply refer to Life's losses?     Philip Van Doren Stern devotes a page-length note to this paragraph.  He mentions a few of the major interpretations and refers readers to the bibliography for more.  His conclusion is: "Since there is no clear explanation, each reader will have to supply his own."     Walter Harding offers three pages in a special appendix that covers all the major theories.  At the end, he too suggests that "each reader is free to interpret them as he wishes." Jeffrey Cramer's paragraph cites two similiar excerpts found in other Thoreau pieces, and his explanation states that "no analysis has been generally accepted as valid."  So the three men agree: we have to decide for ourselves what we think of the story.  "There was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive after perfection."  ("Conclusion")    Is the parable that follows that opening sentence based on some of the Eastern texts that Thoreau was fond of reading at the time?  Or is it a thinly-disguised depiction of his own struggle to perfect the final WALDEN manuscript?  Philip Van Doren Stern simply says that "no one has been able to find a source for the legend" and agrees with Arthur Christy that it is an allegory about Thoreau's own life.  Walter Harding offers several possible origins of the legend but eventually cites and agrees with Christy's allegory statement.  Jeffrey Cramer devotes just a two-sentence annotation, concluding with "It is generally agreed that the following fable is by Thoreau."  In this instance, Cramer has the benefit of time over his colleagues. Most Thoreauvians have come to the same realization during the past decade after much gnashing of teeth.  Explanatory differences are more pronounced at other various junctures in the text.  Each man obviously was intrigued by certain references more than others.  I can say that overall, I found Jeffrey Cramer's annotations to be the most helpful of the three.  Maybe someday someone will have the courage to tell all the makers of posters, bumper stickers, and t-shirts that "Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in" is NOT about fishing at all.  Every school and public library should own at least one of these annotated editions.  Academic libraries will want at least two of the three versions.  If you want a book that has a lot more HDT than just WALDEN, find a used copy of the Philip Van Doren Stern book.  If you want to hear from expert Walter Harding, choose his.  Individuals who want the most comprehensive interpretation should go with the newest volume by Jeffrey Cramer.  It's a worthy addition to the Thoreau legacy 
 Because the X-Men are cool again.   Joss Whedon, to put it bluntly, made the X-Men have value again.  The first storyline not only brought back the elements of the X-Men that made sense, but told a tight story that among other things brought in a shadowy version of SHIELD, a cure for mutants, and most importantly, returned Colossus from the dead.  Oh yes, and it made the X-Men actually seem to work together as a team, and actually made you care. Both the interaction with Wolverine and Cyclops to the return of Colossus and the role with Kitty Pryde, this was old school X-Men, and adding to the mix a new problem for being a mutant: If you could be cured, would you be?  For the better part of 25 years, Mutant persecution has been the staple of the X-Franchise, the thinly veiled attack on society's views of being different. Now, the real question isn't the place for mutants in the world, but if you had a chance to be normal, to 'fit in', would you? It turns the classic (and over-used) dilemma facing a mutant on its ear.   The best part of this volume and the Whedon X-Men is that every character  gets to shine, from Wolverine to the Beast, each character gets to do their thing. That was something that seemed to be missed, and I have to say, I like Whedon's take on both Colossus/Kitty and his characterization of Cyclops. Whedon can write both dialog and story, and the ploting is tight, as is the art.   I can honestly say this is the reason I started collecting X-Books again, and looking forward to it 
 JA Rodgers was ahead of his time when it came to historical reserch. He exposed alot of things that even in our xenophobic world we are afriad to talk about. He discovered through his reserch many of the great people of the past was infact blacks,and that they had been covered up by white wash over centuries. People should read these books with an open mind,because it explains alot in our soceity that are very race conscious people. I learned about Al Jahiz though him and he taught me about many great people I had never even heard of. I never knew about lokman the southern Arabian sage that was considered one of the wisest men. I never knew about the black vikings in this book called blaumen. The book also discussed how many people of the royal family have indeed black ancestry and how they have tried to hide these facts. Get this book to expose the truth and check out other JA Rodgers books 
 The Jacksons 'Victory' album is a collection of songs for true Jackson fans. With titles for every walk of life, this album is not just for Saturday mournings 
        I have to say I love this book! It is awsome! I had heard it was boring, slow getting into, stupid and about everything else bad about it you can think of. Those comments were and are the understatements of the year!           I like this book so much because you can relate and feel like your being the character. I also like it because it has something for everyone for kids their is a young character, for men their is a war story, and for women their is a love story.          The story is strong because it has so much agony and yet the family holds through it all. It holds through death, suffering, and through war.          Overall this book is very wishy-washy but it is good none the less!!!  
 What an interesting little memoir! Paul Collins is a humorous writer who knows how to keep the laughs understated. Odd bits of trivia pop up every page or two as Collins and family move to the Welsh town of Hay-on-Wye--the town of books. With 1,500 people, Hay-on-Wye has 40 bookstores and seems like just the place for Collins and his also-an-author wife to raise their new son. So they leave San Francisco and its high rents and fast-paced life behind, and soon they're trying to buy a house in Hay-on-Wye, only to find that every house for sale is either a new-built cookie-cutter or requires complete gutting because it's over 400 years old.  All of this sounds banal, but it isn't--in the hands of Collins it's a happy little tale that you can't help but enjoy. The author's struggles to conjure up a title for his first book, about notable failures, coincide with working in a burned-out castle where ancient books arrive in cargo containers and are sorted and re-sorted for no apparent purpose, and this dovetails with Collins' ill-formed notion that he can become a member of the House of Lords. (The book, by the way, ends up being called "Banvard's Folly: Thirteen Tales of People Who Didn't Change the World," and it is also well worth reading.)  None of this description does this book justice. It's the kind of book that you can read before bed; you won't kill yourself trying to finish it, because it breaks up nicely, and you'll fall asleep content and at peace.  Collins works with Dave Eggers, he of "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius" fame, and his most recent book, "Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism," carries the story started in this memoir further, so I'm sure we'll hear more from him in the future. For now, pick up "Sixpence House." You won't regret it 
 When I was a kid, I dreamed of being an astronaut.  That wasn't to be, but this book inspired me to go into science and engineering and now I'm a successful programmer; I've heard the book influenced many other people similarly, including many who worked on the space program. If you have similar interests, I think you'll find Rocket Ship Galileo absorbing, even if dated 
 I'm a sucker for anything that tweaks and lampoons authority, and this is a fabulous example of that kind of fun.   I have a great many friends who can't get past how Sedaris looks in her role as Jerri Blank - but for me that's the least of the issues.   Laugh out loud funny  - Jellineck and Noblet are wonderful, but the principal Mr. Blackman steals most of the show.   The FREEDOM episode in this set is brilliant - 
 Delivered as advertised. Good strong quality material - covered my Weber like a glove. Difficult to find a cover that was not black so I was delighted to find a quality alternative. No complaints 
 I LOVE my new Steve Maddens!  They are brand new as described and I received them verrrry quickly 
 Lost in Tibet is a rare kind of book, that gives more than it promises. It deals with an apparently remote and forgotten, or better not renowned episode of WWII. During a flight on "The Hump", the airway help provided by the USA to China, an aircraft carrying five not well acquainted militaries, gets lost in a storm and crashes in a remote Tibetan valley. With great difficulties and much suffering the five survive and are conducted to Lhasa. In 1943 Lhasa was exactly how we see it in Harrer's "Seven years in Tibet", a forbidden and xenophobic city, where only Englishmen and Chinese were accepted and tolerated (making exception only for Harrer and Aufschneider, which were Austrians). The arrival of the Americans is widely misinterpreted by the touchy Tibetans fearfull of Chinese invasion and they are object of a diplomatic upheaval. They are "guests" first of the Chinese and finally of the British delegation. After a long permanence the finally receive the permission to leave Lhasa and undertake a terrible journey back to India in the Tibetan winter on snowridden passes.  The interest of the book lies naturally in the story, which for me was completely unknown, but expecially in how the authors make all the possibile connections with history and crossreference the whole episode to contemporary documents and successive interviews with the protagonists and their acquaintaces.  We learn of the quality and entity of airway traffic on the Hump, together with political problems of Tibet in those years before Chinese occupation. We meet interesting people such as the Chinese Kung and the Englishman George Sheriff and his wife Betty with their love for himalayan flora. We understand the geography of the Tibetan plateau rivers. The book is deeply researched and a great amount of work lies behind its fast snappy prose. The journalistic cut is evident, and the most information is passed in the least number of words. At moments I had the impression of a TV special.  Excellent and instructive read 
 "Going To A Go-Go" is one of the best albums by this group.  Not only did it spit out singles such as "Going To A Go-Go", "Choosey Begger", "The Tracks Of My Tears", "Ohh Baby Baby" and of course the fillers such as "Since You Won My Heart" & "Let Me Have Some". In my opinion, this is the best album by this group. It was a contemporary of the Temptations "Temptations Sing Smokey" & "Temptin' Temptations" in which both lp's spat out quite a few hit singles & B'sides themselves in which Smokey himself produced. Smokey is a genius. Even tho the CD has added tracks, it's just another album by Smokey Robinson & The Miracles in 1966 "Away We Go-Go". But the original "Going to a go go" is the best of all.  Enjo 
 Many have felt that this novel is too wordy.  My view is that the author's writing style is wordy, but every sentence is beautifully written.  I felt that I could imagine.  The story is really a character study and another look at the effects of the holocaust.  The survivors may have escaped death, but the horrors stay with them.  I do know some survivors.  All of them need sleeping pills because they can't sleep without them.  Sophie had no control over what happened to her yet she suffers from unimaginable guilt.  This novel digs into the human psyche effectively. 
 There are times in our lives when we come across sexual devient behaviors we learn from new lovers and this causes great excitement and newness to our relationships.  Why not have your own fantasies?  Well, thats because we have to learn some from books like Taboo.  It not only arouses you while reading it but you realize that there are actual fantasies written that are like your own.  all the stories are great in this book with incredible eroticism in every line.  I especially like Felix D' Angelos story 'Rest Stop'.  Also, the one story where they have a gimp.  How fun would that be for both lovers.  I can't wait until more books are written by Violet Blue.  Keep up the great work.  Every couple would last longer if they had the ability to share fantasies or act them out.  Can you say less divorces 
 This is a collection of translations of the writings of St. Patrick, his  contemporaries, and heirs, with expert commentary by De Paor. He begins  with an introduction to European Christianity at the time of St. Patrick.  Included in the documents are the accounts of various councils and synods  connected to the evangelization of Ireland, the writings of St. Patrick  himself, and the annals, letters, and lives written by and of St. Patrick's  followers. This is a treasure trove of materials for research into the life  of St. Patrick 
 I took the CISSP exam in mid-December 2005 (I know, what a way to start the holidays.) and received an email two weeks and change later that I had passed and did my endorsement that week to be official. I used this book as the main text for reviewing for the exam. It covers all the domains as thoroughly as possible in one text and provides you with a solid base of knowledge with which to measure against the exam questions. I have a decent background in IS security but many of the concepts you are tested on require a lot of "book knowledge" in addition to hands-on experience. This book covers it all! You may want to select one of the other top sellers; such as Shon Harris' book, to read concurrently - domain by domain and cross compare but this is the one that still sits on my bookshelf as a reference for everything from cryptology to law & ethics. It is VERY heavily slanted towards the "Networking & Telecommunications" domain as well as "Operational Security" but there is a practical reason for this. 
 Vampire of the Mist by Christie Golden is the re-release of the first book that launched the Ravenloft world. This book was first released by TSR in September of 1991. It seems Wizards of the Coast may be trying to revive the Ravenloft world as they are starting to re-release some novels that have been out of print for a long time. I will say this, if you are a fan of fantasy vampire novels this is a must read.  The plot of this book is a very well thought-out plot. It is deep and has several layers to it that the reader is always left wondering what the next page will bring. The basic plot is that of a elven vampire who is trying to seek revenge for the death of someone he loved. The journey and self-discovery that this elf (Jander) partakes in is a fantastic ride. Along the way there are various small sub-plots, but they by no means hinder the overall plot, quite the opposite they add considerable depth to the story and allow the reader to `feel' the story as Ms. Golden intended it. Being that this was the first book in the Ravenloft world Ms. Golden also does a phenomenal job at describing all the things that make Ravenloft unique and interesting. Things such as the fog, the gypsies, Castle Ravenloft, history and countless other things. This truly is a gem of a book.  The characters in this book add so much to the overall story. They are extremely well fleshed out and the development of the characters rivals that of any fantasy book I can think of. Characters such as Jander, Strahd, Sasha, etc develop so much it's amazing that this was only a 300 page book. If you are wanting to read more about Jander there is an additional short strory in the Wizards of the Coast Anthology titled Best of the Realms and the short story title is called `Blood Sport'. The depth that Ms. Golden gives Jander just makes the character so much more real and fun to read about.  Overall, this is one of the best single novels I have read in quite a long time. Everything about this novel `works'. There is just enough of things to alow the reader to form a mental picture, without over burdening the reader with unnecessary facts that slow the story. As I said before, if you are a fan of vampire novels you must read this. If you are a fantasy fan I am almost certain you will enjoy this as well. If you are a fan of reading and are looking at a fantasy book, I would without a doubt recommend this one. I truly can't say enough about this wonderful book. I highly recommend this to everyone.  
 Paco de Lucia is the best flamenco guitarist ever. This album is pure flamenco, del bueno, de corazón, flamenco de verdad!!! Great new compositiosn and amazing collaborations throughout the whole recording. If you are just atrting out get this, if you're a long time Paco fan, getthis too! 
 As most every one of my friends is privy, I am a HUGE fan of Will Ferrell.  I personally think he is one of the funniest men in work today, and he never fails to impress me.  That said, `Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' is one of his funniest most entertaining films and is sure to please any fan of Ferrell.  As Ricky Bobby, Ferrell plays a man obsessed with going fast.  The first few minutes of the film introduce you to his loser father whose only words of advise to his young son are "if your not first, your last" and that's the motto Ricky's lived by his whole life.  Twenty-five years later and he is first in every race, his best friend Cal (Reilly who is just as funny as Ferrell) always coming in second place.  When Jean Girard (Cohen), a gay French racer, comes to take Bobby's spot at the top things turn ugly, and when a stroke of bad luck hits our hero he's left at the bottom, his `smoking hot wife' Carley (Leslie Bibb) leaving him for Cal and taking his house sending him to live with his mother (Jane Lynch) and his two hellion children Walker (Houston Tumlin) and Texas Ranger (Grayson Russell).  With the help of his father Reese (Gary Cole) Ricky is able to regain his passion for the race and regain his place at the top.  With non-stop laughs provided by the entire cast, not just the always hilarious Ferrell, but everyone from Reilly to Michael Clarke Duncan and Amy Adams and Molly Shannon (who plays a priceless drunk!), this makes for one brilliant ensemble film  With one liners that will live as long as "you my boy Blue" and moments that will go down as the funniest we've seen from this brilliant SNL alumni, Ferrell has cemented himself as one of our most talented comedians, and he can now add writer to his resume, for he shows great chops with this script.  I haven't been this entertained in quite a long time.  Forget Pirates, this is the summer blockbuster...best I've seen this year 
 There's little need to review this CD after Daniel Hamlow's thoughtful and informative critique above, but I loved the CD so much I had to weigh in.  In case you aren't familiar with his citations, he mentions the big three Brazilian music classics: Astrud Gilberto's "Jazz Masters 9" from Verve, "Jazz Samba" featuring Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd also from Verve, and Bebel Gilberto's "Tanto Tempo."  If you liked the soundtrack, you should find these three CDs.  I'm not usually a big fan of movie soundtracks, but "Woman on Top," is not a typical movie soundtrack in that it stands by itself as a music CD, you really don't need to even know the movie to enjoy it.  Although the CD is misleadingly titled "Penolope Cruz:  Woman on Top" she's only the CD cover art.  The musical performances feature some of Brazil's best contemporary samba crooners.  This CD should appeal to fans of Brazilian music, jazz fans, world music fans, as well as people who enjoyed the movie 
 "Brief Lives" has always been a delight, but it was Oliver Lawson Dick's scholarly editing that revealed Aubrey's genius.  And Lawson Dick's Introduction, "The Life and Times of John Aubrey", is a  miracle of synthesis and compression:  certainly one of the finest  biographical essays ever written.  This Nonpareil Books edition is  sumptuous - a joy to read in these days cheap, quickly produced paperbacks 
 My daughter, a freshman at Indiana University, e-mailed me a list of the books she needed.  This was on it... I ordered it, paid for it, and had it shipped directly to her.  It arrived sooner than expected, and before she needed it for class.    Great Job.    Julie K 
 I purchased this book to learn about yield curve inversions and how to use that information in making decisions on when to exit the stock market.  The book meets those two goals and provides a real basis on how to improve market returns by avoiding potentially large losses.  The price of the book is a little high.  The section on cultural factors such as hemlines and bust sizes did not match well with the main theme of the book. Is it worth $35 to improve stock market returns by a few percent? Duh. Yeah 
 The best book I've read on the topic of addiction. It cuts through all  the misinformation on the subject and in clear and easy to understand language it explains how and why people become addicted and gives practical steps on how to get past it by using a combination of the 7 tools. This book is perfect for someone who feels trapped in the maze of an addicton, has tried 12 Step and other programs, sincerely wants to stop, and still can't find their way out of it. Stanton Peele explains how to cure an addiction and get on with your life 
 Wow! Before this set from Blood and Fire, I really didn't know about Yabby U. Now I do! Although this costs more because it is a double CD set, it is WELL worth the extra investment. These tracks are some of the best work  done by King Tubby. Its nice how there are several different versions of  many of these tracks included on the album. BUY THIS if you know and love  King Tubby and the Aggrovators 
 This book is well worth the money for its content and unique illustrations 
 Many have said you need to be older (at least 40) to appreciate this book, but I loved it and I'm only 26.  Jewett made me feel like I was really there in Dunnet Landing, and since the narrator is never named, I felt like I was the narrator, living her experiences (it helps that the narrator in this story is a writer and so am I).  I loved Jewett's descriptive language and rich characterization.  I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates beautiful imagery and unforgetful characters.  My favorite character in the novel is Mrs. Todd's mother, Mrs. Blackett -- I wish I was as loving and giving and self-forgetful as she is!  My husband and I are planning a trip to coastal Maine this summer, and I will be thinking about this novel while I'm there 
 This was a really amazing book.  When I first picked it up I had a hard time not seeing the people from the movie in my mind but eventually I got past that and really loved it.  The book is always better.  
 Part of why this book was so great was of course, the subject. I was in love with a girl when I read it. Anyone who is non-straight will feel a lot of what the characters are feeling, and I think most people who read this book would sympathize. It would be a good book for any young person to read, especially since it is non-explicit and wouldn't freak out anyone who wouldn't want to read a description of lesbian sex. I would say this book describes a lot of the feelings of being non-straight: not really admitting it to yourself, being scared people will find out, not having anywhere to go where you can be honest with the person, as well as the more outward reactions: judgment by people with conservative mindsets, curiosity of peers, and especially the reaction of family: concerned even though they still love you. (Of course there are many exceptions, but I would say this is kind of typical) I do think the author could have described some of these feelings (especially not admitting it to yourself) in greater detail. I also didn't see a lot of chemistry between the two girls- I could see the attraction, but I don't see completely what made them fall madly in love. Even adults I know don't talk as properly as these two- their talking was kind of flowery and cut off. It seemed like they kept being about to say something important, but they stopped themselves.  I liked the scene where there is the school board meeting, and the reaction of her former friend. The reaction of Mrs Poindexter shows how judgmental people can be, and it shows a bit of hypocriticalness too, or at least the way people make too much of a big deal out of it. In a way Mrs P and Eliza's former friend are a bit caricature, but there also are people like that in real life.  I would also like to add that you will probably not have the same experience of being in a school board meeting, and you probably can find more time to be alone than these two did (they never heard of sleepovers?). So, maybe your experience will be better.  I wonder if this is on the "books that were censored" list. That's a real shame, because this is a sweet book that will give a person a sense of hope. I don't think it is a bad influence at all. It focuses on love, not sex, and could help someone understand what it's like. 
 I love this movie.  Bette Midler and Trini Alvarado deserve oscars in my oppinion.  "Stella" is about the relationship of a mother and daughter (in reality it could be any dysfuncional family) and how fate deals it's cards to the "unfortunate".  It doesn't help that Stella is jaded and a B@#$%. This movie captures a mother's maturnal instinct who wants the best for her only child.  Stella deals with the cards that are dealt to her in the game of life.  She is impoverished but well read and because of the "BS", OVER IT.  Bette Midler captures this type of character with a realness you rarely see on film.  I see similarities to my own mother so I guess that's why I can indentify with her.  Although I can practically memorize the dialogue it remains one of my favourite films. 
 My son had a great time playing with this toy. I liked the durability ( it made it through Christmas ) 
 explainsa variety of exploits and tells you how to harden your network. This book is very well researched and extremely well written and is reader friendly, as some security books leave the reader lost in techno babble, not this book however very easy reading it now sits on my desk as a ready reckoner 
 This book was purchased for a grooming class I took. It provided a wealth of information and will be a great information tool in the future.  Great content 
 I had never listened to Joe, had no idea who he was until my boyfriend and I started going on long drives up to the mountains and he was constantly playing Joe's CDs.  This was the first CD to catch my attention, and I totally fell in love with it! "Up In The Sky," "House Full Of Bullets" and "Crystal Planet" are great when you're snaking up a mountain road at about 55 mph. "Love Thing" is my absolute favorite track - actually, my favorite Joe song. Period.  It's very mellow and just beautiful! From "Trundrumbalind" on, you just can't go wrong. I wish that "Time" came a little sooner in the album (#14 of 15), another excellent track - it always gets you drumming your hands on the steering wheel. I was lucky enough to see him live twice last year, and you couldn't wipe the smile off of my face!  Joe is one of the best musicians around and you are sorely lacking if you don't have at least Crystal Planet in your music library 
 this book along with spraycan art,getting up,stylewars,wild style,beat street,countless video clips & so on started the world wide graffiti and hip hop culture. when i first got this book seven years ago ive spent a good 20 hours studying it. this book is well known as the most stolen book in the u.k from the set of two " graff bibles " spraycan art being the other one if you don't have this book and you like old school ny trains from where it all started you really need to get this book MUST BUY 
 I think that this was a very good book. It clearly described each member of Sherwood forest, their attitudes, strenghths, weaknesses etc.  I especially loved Cecily and her mysterious "secret". It also struck me how she used a comparatively small character to save Robin Hood's life at the end. It was ironic how Robin Hood was made out not to be such a good fighter, but mainly a peaceful kind of guy who was happiest when he was alone, even though he is supposed to be known for his archery. I didn't really like the ending. I think that the Lionheart should have given them each a full pardon and that Robin should have gotten his father's land back. She also never mentioned what happened to Marion's father and who ran her father's estates. All in all, I think that this was an excellent book, apart from the few loose threads that she didn't tie up in the end. I loved this book. 
 If you want to capture every precious moments, this is the right camcorder for you. It's easy to operate and the video is crisp and clear. The sound is pretty good as well. You can also take still picture and video at the same time (thanks to the memory stick).    Don't burn your video using your computer, it took me time to download to a CD or DVD. Instead burn them as you watch them. It's quicker that way.   You will love it the first time you use it 
 This book met my needs for updating my secretarial resources. I haven't done administrative support for about 10 years and this brought me up-to-date on a lot of the changes. A worthwile addition to your library resources 
 Mr. Compton says that he'd tried to write a first-aid manual for diesel engines and I'd have to say that's just what he's done in this very user friendly book. The book is full of great, easy to understand illustrations that make it easy for even the raw beginner to get involved with his iron jenny. This is a must have book for any cruising sailor 
 If you are looking for a "how" book, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a "why" book this is the one.  Why is trust important?  Why are relationships essential?  Why follow the relationship-based approach?  The answers lie here.  It is a well documented and, I believe, important book to read 
 Margaret Fuller is an exceptional writer that combines how to get to some of the best locations in Idaho with a little history of the areas you might explore. I own all of her guidebooks and would recommend them to anyone. One of my favorite pieces of information that she includes is how long a hike will take which makes it nice since I can plan better. Being a native Idahoan growing up in Salmon I was surprise at how much information and different hikes Margaret has put into her books. The Frank Church Wilderness and the Bighorn Crags is a must for any avid backpacker. I could loose myself in those mountains (in a good way). The Bighorn Crags have been a favorite of mine since I was 16 when I first explored their trails. Margaret does a great job of getting you into some great country and away from everyone. Don't forget to plan a trip to Airplane and Ship Island Lake then day hike to some of the surrounding lakes. Just wonderful 
 	Set during the Great Depression, this novel chronicles the life of a family of sharecroppers, the Joads. They are driven from their home in Oklahoma due to the Dust Bowl (a series of dust storms causing severe drought) and hard times. Along with thousands of others who have also lost their land, the Joads decide to move to California with the promise of work and a better way of life. However, once they get there, they find that there is not much work to be found and even if they get work, the pay isn't fair. The Californians they encounter treat them with disdain, calling them "Okies" and fearful that these newcomers might band together and take over the land.  	John Steinback's writing is so vivid that you could almost believe that the main characters actually existed in real life. The protagonist, Tom Joad, is portrayed as a man willing to protect his family, but with a temper that occasionally interferes with the course of his life. The novel opens with Tom Joad being released on parole from killing a man in self-defense. The man he encounters on his way back home, Jim Casy, is another artfully crafted character; a preacher with a penchant for giving long speeches about life and its inner workings. They walk together to Tom Joad's former residence, only to find that it is deserted. When they get to the house of Tom's uncle, the rest of his family is preparing to move, thus Tom Joad and Casy decide to go with them to California, and so the story goes on.  	A combination of authentic Oklahoma dialogue and articulate descriptions of scenery and action allow this novel to almost live and breathe, as if it is being presented before your eyes. The effect of this novel is similar to that of Charles Dickens' writing; that is, the novel is so close to the history it represents, it will leave quite an impact upon you and serve as a reminder to how powerful great story-telling can be 
 If you already know you want to read Hero of Our Time, then this is the translation you want. Vladimir Nabokov, who translated this book with his son, is himself a Russian writer, who achieved such a high level of understanding of English as an emigre that he wrote his books and stories in both languages! The translation is fluid and Nabokov's footnotes are invaluable. He claims to have done this translation because he saw all the others as inferior.  As to the book itself, it is fascinating for the way in which Lermontov toys with you, inhibiting you from a clear sense of what kind of person Pechorin is. Questions concerning point of view and structure makes the book a fascinating read over and over again 
 Not exactly a quick read or a page turner but still a good book with a good amount of depth 
 Discovered by New York club empresario Steve Paul in 1968, and signed to a hefty, six-figure contract, Johnny Winter stayed true to his Texas rock and roll, r and b, and blues roots on Second Winter, his 1969 offering that many people consider his best album. Most artists either scatter their best material over the entire album or place the best songs near the front for maximum listening effectiveness. Second Winter is one of the few albums I know where (to me) the best material is saved for last. The album starts out fine with the searing "Memory Pain," a tribute to addiction recovery with scalding lyrics, and an intense vocal performance from Johnny. The next two tracks, "I'm Not Sure," and "The Good Love," are good, not great songs; again, it's surprising that Winter (or his record company) should choose to place such mediocre material first. Then comes brother Edgar Winter's tinkling saloon piano, and right away, you know your in for something special with the first of two fabulous Little Richard covers, "Slippin' and Slidin'." Edgar's greasy roadhouse sax playing and Johnny's fiery guitar solo put you in early rock and roll heaven! Next, Johnny gives an impassioned vocal performance of Richard's "Miss Ann," filled with warmth, humor, and passion. Too much! Then, a first-rate rendition of the Chuck Berry standard "Johnny B Goode," makes the overplayed chestnut seem fresh and new. Winter also proves that Bob Dylan, like many great poets, has roots in the blues with his honking, shouting version of "Highway 61 Revisited". Outa Site! (as we used to say in the Dark Ages!). This superfine CD closes with four fabulous originals: The guitar-laden "I Love Everybody," the horn-driven "I Hate Everybody," the hard-driving "Hustled Down In Texas," and the ultra-psychedelic, marching beat, guitar-on-mega-overdrive swagger of "Fast Life Rider." Take me home, mama! So, if you love great Texas blues, particularly of the pre-Stevie Ray Vaughan, psycho-killer variety, grab a listen to Second Winter today. It bees goode!! 
 Can his music get any better. So many songs, so little time to listen. One of his best 
 Sherman Alexie's Reservation Blues begins with the mysterious re-appearance of the legendary blues singer Robert Johnson on the Spokane Indian Reservation where he meets Thomas Builds-the-Fire (one of many characters in this novel familiar to readers of Alexie's collection of short stories, The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven).  Johnson, perhaps the most famous of all pre-World War II blues performers, recorded twenty-nine selections for Colombia Records before his death in 1938 from a glass of poisoned whiskey.  But over the years Johnson's death has been shrouded in mystery and legend; even at the time many people wondered if the young musician, who'd bragged of obtaining his unique guitar prowess from selling his soul at a crossroads, hadn't been killed by a jealous girlfriend after all, but, perhaps by the devil come to collect on an old debt.  Johnson steps onto the reservation as if from out of nowhere and tells Thomas Builds-the-Fire he's looking for a woman who lives on a hill and might help him save his soul.  Builds-the-Fire takes him to meet Big Mom, a powerful near-deity, believed to be at least several hundred years old, living on the top of Wellpoint Mountain.    Presented in a collage beautifully written vignettes, Alexie creates a series of of mostly humorous, sometimes heartwarming, yet usually disturbing stories of a defeated people struggling on a day-to day basis to maintain their identity and self respect 
 The author, Bill Treasurer, teaches the value of taking risks.  Rather than stagnate or remain disenchanted with your life or circumstances, you learn how to take the right risk.  Before my brother's, Frank, death he read a copy of this book which helped him clarify some of his impending decisions.  I am so glad that he chose to "take the leap" and live the remaining days of his life truly happy.    Embedded in every situation is a risk, only you can choose what is right.  Make the right choice and live.  Thank you Bill. 
 Wow, what can I say that 100+ other reviewers haven't already said, except, "Far out, dude!" This is a terrific read for people who don't normally read fantasy, provided you're willing to open your mind a bit. What about the younger readers? No problem--they will "get" this book where some adults won't. It's not so much about magic as it is a magical adventure in "suspension of disbelief"--my favorite phrase when it comes to fantasy writing. Enjoy 
 This is the second of the multi-volume work by the Durant's.  It is as good as the first (and not wanting to give anything away, chuckle), they only get better and better.  The author's prose is almost as wonderful as the actual historical work.  The author apparently spent fifty years in writing these books and it certainly was worth the effort.  He, and his wife, make history come alive.  Now granted, I am a history buff and simply cannot get enough of it.  I realize that not all share my love for the subject, but I truely feel that the entire work should be required reading in our schools. Not only are they superior to any and all text I am familiar with, they are truely a joy to read.  This particular volume gave me much more insight to the ancient Greeks, their culture, art and philosophy than any work I have read, thereby giving me a much better understanding to our own culture, etc.  It's just me, I know, but an added joy to this work was prowling used book stores and finding these things one by one to add to my collection.  Highly recommend these books. 
 This covers more than just character animation.  It's really an incredible book.  The techniques taught make it the most valuable book in my 3D modeling & animation library.  I was pleased 
 John has another Cd....It's called Are we there yet?.  He is with out a doubt a christian  rapper.  Buy the CD! 
 I'm an 8 year old Canadian living in Beijing, China, and I love to read. I really like to read funny books. One of my favourites of all time is Calvin & Hobbes, "Weirdos from Another Planet". I find this book  really funny because Calvin's imagination in this one is the wildest ever!  The illustrations are a perfect match for the hilarious stories. I enjoyed  the main part of this book, the space adventures of Calvin & Hobbes the  best. I found them so funny that I couldn't put the book down in bed, and  stayed awake very late. This book made me a real fan of Calvin and Hobbes,  and now I can't wait to get more! Elise Hoffmann 8 years old, Beijing,  Chin 
 Since releasing their debut album, Wisconsin Death Trip, Static-X has not given a more evil disco effort than their latest album, Cannibal. It has been eight years (and four studio albums) since any music of their's has been able to closely compare to the style of their debut. The pounding, repetitive beats and electronic sounds have returned with a vengeance, and this could possibly be labeled the band's heaviest effort. This is not to say this is the best album in the catalogue, but grab a candle, because Cannibal deserves to hold one at least in the vicinity of Wisconsin Death Trip.  The first great improvement is Static-X bringing Koichi Fukuda, their original guitarist, back into the picture. After parting ways with replacement guitarist Tripp Eisen due to his issues with the law (which don't need to be discussed here), Fukuda was asked to re-join. He was an influence on the band's disco guitar riffs and programming in the early years, and there's a noticeable difference in style on Cannibal in comparison to the previous three albums he didn't work on. Actually, Fukuda did handle some of the programming duties on the last album, Start A War, but he was not an official member of the band.  The second great improvement is Wayne Static reviving his gritty, raw vocals. As the years have passed by, the hair spray fanatic has used his vocals differently. On Cannibal we see a return of his old self, viciously spitting out lyrics.  Cannibal's track listing is as heavy as ever, if not the heaviest it has ever been. From start ("Cannibal") to finish ("Team Hate"), Static-X is in your face, firing on all cylinders. One characteristic not typically heard of is the emergence of guitar solos, which is both a breath of fresh air and bewilderment. Some of the solos are a nice addendum, and others seem unnecessary, taking away from the simple structure fans have known and loved. With or without solos, Cannibal is precisely what the doctor ordered: thirty-seven minutes of evil disco 
 Wanda Jackson never received the awards she deserves, maybe someone will wake up and give her at least the Country Music Hall of Fame or Rockabilly Hall of Fame. this CD as a little of both and they are the best 
 Michael Mann is a director who is very music conscious, I like directors who are very music conscious. Filmmakers who take the time to work out how the music and the images will go together and the kind of music to put in their movies. The soundtrack to the movie 'Heat' is mostly a success. Look at the names of the contributors alone, Elliot Goldenthal, the Kronos Quartet, Terje Rypdal, Moby, Brian Eno, Lisa Gerrard and more. It makes for quite a listen. Elliot Goldenthal is the primary name here, he is the composer of the original music score, he has the most number of tracks on this CD and even though some of his industrial sounding tracks are repetitive and annoying, he can create absolutely gorgeous sounds, check out the first 2 and a half minutes of track 1, labeled 'Heat', truly beautiful work by Goldenthal, ( the Kronos Quartet perform it ). Another highlight of the soundtrack is the dreamy track 10, by Terje Rypdal, titled 'Mystery Man'. Goldenthal later returns on other selections, many tragic and mournful.  Moby performs 'New Dawn Fades', not his song apparently and Moby also wrote and performs the haunting, minimalist final track on this CD, 'God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters', a hypnotic landscape of sound which perfectly evokes the final, tragic moments of the film. Yes, I know the version in the film is slightly different from this one here, get both versions if you must, it's only a few seconds of difference.  If it wasn't for some of that annoying industrial music interspersed throughout the CD, I would have put this among my highest recommendations. It is still a must own if you liked the movie and especially if you enjoy listening to movie scores/sountracks 
 I found a worn copy of this slim, powerful work in a dusty used bookstore in Portland, Maine. That is the best way to find book, by the way...i recommend it. But, if this is your only means of purchasing this volume, i recommend this way too.  Jorge Luis Borges is brilliant beyond the comprehension of normal man. Jorge Luis Borges can constuct the fantastic through the innovative manipulation of language as no one else can. Jorge Luis Borges has absolutely no regard for reality whatsoever.  ..but only in the best of senses...  Discussing a fictional entry in a fictional volume of the Encyclopedia Brittanica, Borges leads the reader to witness the creation of an entirely new world - grants it a mythology, a legal structure, and a myriad of necessary societal quirks.  And this is one of the pieces that impresses me the least.   In "The Circular Ruins" we witness an entirely surreal event occuring in a land with no context - no history, no geography.  The dreamer and his creation are mere vehicles of the plot, which itself is extranneous.  Borges's characters evoke no sympathy or empathy; they have no tangible presence, but are merely the embodiments of concepts.  Without real indentities, their names are often omitted entirely.  There is something Big about his work.  It continuously reminds me that there is so much that I am not understanding; there is so much in the beyond me.  I can almost hear the ideas, the symbolisms, the metaphors, whipping past my head, and I love it. A delicious challenge, an exercise in humility.  The feeling is akin to that of standing at the base of a very tall mountain, or looking up at the night sky when the clouds have parted, revealing the black infinity between the stars - so vast in scale we can't wrap our consciousness around it, but we often love to try, to marvel at the sheer scope of it.  In "Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote" he makes the statement "There is no intellectual exercise which is not ultimately useless.  A philosophical doctrine is in the beginning a seemingly true description of the universe; as the years pass it becomes a mere chapter - if not a paragraph or a noun - in the history of philosophy" which can be a damn depressing thought - 'This is all minutia, these massive theories, these concepts, this which we base our world on, when given perspective is insignifigant." There's nothing like feeling that everything you've studied and contemplated and lost sleep over is no less than negligible, in the broad scheme of things. Its somewhat refreshing.  Of course, thinking over that concept is an intellectual exercise in itself.  I in no way denounce this futile, pointless mulling over of philosophy, literature, what the meaning of life is and and other cliched questions to deliberate over. What is accompished by this? Absolutely nothing. The hungry aren't fed, the ozone is still rapidly deteriorating and The Killers are still overplayed.  Yet I persist.  I will always love being made to truly think, being fascinated by the complex and obscure, being introduced to the absurd, and I hope you do to.  Read this book 
 Excellent self help book, that really expresses the desires of a mother. Wanting to show her daughters the basics and express the joys of the world. A must have for any mothers or fathe 
 This cd is very pretty but I loved some of their other cds a lot better.  This cd is a little more adult sounding not all that electronic as some of their previous work was.  Not as dancy but never the less a good cd 
 We got this for my daughter for Christmas and she just loves it. The music is a little loud but she highly enjoys it 
 This game was a lot of fun, you can do so much and the dark humor was great.  The only gripe I have is that it was just way to short and easy.  I easily beat this game in about 3 days, and I still have 2 days left on my rental.  I would say rent this game, because you can easily beat it within a week.    So overall, here is a break down of the Pros and Cons.  Pros: -Playing pranks on students  -The missions are a lot of fun -The side missions are also a lot of fun, bring more to the story -Good Dark Comedy, like all other Rockstar games -Unlocking funny constumes, like the black ninja costume to stay out past curfew -All the different Cliques were great, and being able to beat up and bully anybody is a lot of fun  Cons: -Just way too easy, the missions can be beaten very easily. -Incredibly short, nothing like the Grand Theft Auto Games where it can take a month to unlock everything, I was able to unlock everything in 3 days. -Would've loved to see some of the same things from GTA:SA in Bully.  EX: In GTA:SA you are able to have gang members follow you and do what you want.  It would've been great to see that in Bully.  Overall:  I would suggest renting, a lot of fun, but easily beaten, not worth $50 
 Very cool slacker-soundtrack that distinguishes itself by not always sounding the same, having a perfect grip on pop sensibilities and a lyrical/vocal quirkiness. A tremendously good band and an album I don't  think I could make it through my twenties without 
 Twenty five years ago, I awoke on a Sunday morning in Cevio, Switzerland. The previous night, a dinner party featuring fresh ravioli, butter sautï¿½ed Sage, beets and shell beans provided the background for strangers and friends to come together. After dining, the party walked down to the river to watch the full moon rise over the mountain valley while singing Italian Folk songs accompanied by a mandolin. The old caretaker with his pet crow sat quietly passing two bowls of coffee, one bowl bitter and one bowl sweet. Long after everyone had gone to bed, the church bells peeled in the dark damp early morning, bouncing giant waves of sound off the stone buildings and the rocky walls of the valley. Where the bells originated was indecipherable - the source indeterminate. Sound oozed in through the thick walls and rolled around the room in slow motion, reverberating deep and long, layer upon layer. This CD reminds me of the timelessness of that morning, in the foothills of the Italian Alps, slowly waking to the bells which seemed to resonate inside my mind, rippling through my awakening body as if my being were immersed underwater, my submerged self gradually surfacing. Eno's CD is a great addition to his catalogue - music for caverns, echoes of long now 
 This tv is great. I had it out of the box and playing xbox 360 in full 1080p in no time. I love the rotating stand it works great in my place. I wanted to leave a review because these reviews helped me so much. I went to best buy and looked at the new model from samsung next to the 40" version of this model. The newer one had a slightly better picture, but for me it was not worth an extra 800-1000 dollars. The reason why is because when I got this baby home and fired it up I wanted for nothing. I set the picture settings to my likings, which was easy to do, and I was off to the races. The only thing I would say that could have been better, and I don't even know if this is really an issue with the TV, but when I hooked up older gaming systems like nintendo and nintendo 64 the brightness had to be adjusted to see some games. This is probably more because those consoles weren't made for such tv's, but they still worked fine once I made the adjustments. I read all the complaints on the sound and I completely disagree. I love the sound. As a matter of fact I have to turn down often. By the way, for you gamers, I did some research and found out that xbox 360 does in fact play games in full 1080p with the component or vga cables hooked up. Microsoft released an update last november that added 1080p output, (go ahead just google it or go to microsoft website and look at the resolution or cables section) and after you hook the tv up to the console the display settings have the 1080p option. Therefore this tv is great for either ps3 or xbox 360, and games sure do look gorgeous on it. One other thing that could've been better about the tv is the remote. It is very comfortable in the hand, but it's reception is pretty weak. I will probably get an all in one remote someday. DVD's look great on it. Sound output to my reciever is great. All functions do what they should. Buy this tv its a steal. Enjoy 
 This is a book that needs to be read relatively quickly to get the full effect. A masterful, overwhelming, huge, almost perfect book. He traces the history of the main character through multiple generations of parents to explain in incredible detail the creation of the protagonist. The use of a long running darkness and light metaphor, echoes Conrad, and gives an erieness to the book, the best example of this is early in chapter 15, and incorporates some of his pro-nature anti-business themes.  His critique of industrialism and mindless consumerism at the expense of nature I found to be enormously topical. The concluding 10 pages, particularly the last 100 or so lines are truly epic and wonderful.   Entrenched in the middle of this long book, I found I stopped noticing lawrence's style. Though I repeat the recomendation of reading the book in large chunks 
 I like the book. Plenty of exercises to beat the script into your head. Kinda fun to do these childlike exercises, too 
 This is a great book for the ordinary reader who would enjoy a chance to learn a bit more about the history of our country.   With 176 pages of written text, it can't provide an extremely in- depth description of colonial life, but it does give an excellent overview of the 17th century in America with a surprising amount of detail.  The writing style is engaging and not at all difficult, so the book is easy to finish off in a few days.  I would recommend it 
 This book is about opiate addiction and the author (William Burroughs) was an ex addict. Being I'm an ex heroin addict...it was interesting to me.   Also, my father (Don Swaim) interviewed William Burroughs, when my father worked at C.B.S radio and had a show called "Book Beat."   (...)   In closing,  Although the book is dated, it held my interest and it is a must for any William Burroughs fans.   D. David Swai

 Their sound is truly comforting and romantic. I have every item this group has put out, including their calendar.  In my business (Logistics) which is stressful, this group puts me in a calm demure and I am sure my vendors appreciate it, especially when my freight delivery encounters a problem 
 Well, Ive watched all 4 boxsets in their entirety, all 88 episodes, including the bonus material.  Most fans love the show so I wont get into why its so wonderful and the great chemistry between Dean and Teri, blah blah blah.  Lets get right on to it.  Whats the best material and what, if any, are the problems plaguing the boxsets?                                 There are 3 things that are completely worth your attention, and the majority of it is on season 1.  The commentary for the pilot, and the 30 minute looking back documentary.  The other commentary is on season 2 and its on Deans Season's Greedings episode.  Aside from that, the effort put forth as a whole for bonus material on these 4 boxsets is pathetic.  There is plenty of other stuff out there that they could of included.  ABC promos for every episode exist as well as other spots that appeared to promote the show, and none of it appears on these boxsets.  There is also no comments on the wedding arc in season 3, and nothing to explain the shows untimely demise in the 4th season boxset.  It's simply pathetic. The 4th box needed to explain what was planned for season 5 had the show continued, and none of it is explained at all.      How is the transfer and sound??  Seasons 2,3, and 4 look fantastic all throughout.  However, season 1 gets the lowest grade in the video department.  The pilot, though crisp, has all sorts of source defects and dirt present.  Also, several episodes following the pilot, look too soft and muddy in its picture and detail and color.  This significantly improves though by the time you reach the latter half of disc 3 and on to disc 4.  The sound is standard; nothing too impressive.     Finally, lets talk about the packaging and any other problems related to the dvd's themselves.  The covers work for me, though id say season 1 is the best.  It has a chrome appearance that is just really impressive.  All the others are a dull cardboard.  What they did inside each box has driven me nuts since season 1 was released.  The discs are packaged practically stacked on top of each other.  They overlap; which means that if you want to get to disc 2, you have to pry disc 1 up out of the box in order to get to disc 2.  That is just ridiculous, and for those who arent especially careful with their purchase, it can be really easy to scratch the discs in this format.  While my wife and I have been watching the series in order, I just remove disc 1 from the box and lay it aside in another case so that I have a space freed up for the other discs in the boxset so I can get to everything easier.  That has worked for me.  Though it is annoying that I have to move discs around in the first place.  I would have preferred the WB package them like a book with one disc per tray, but thats just me.  Also, the first 2 seasons feature a moving main menu screen which was really impressive.  The WB then decided that for the last 2 seasons they would cut costs and use a static main menu screen; STUPID AND INCONSISTENT!!  All 4 should match.  They really dropped the ball with their season 4 package in that it was reported that many packages contained duplicate discs!!  One fellow had to exchange his 6 times until he found a package that had a disc 1 in it!!  Fortunately my copy had no such issues.  However I had to exchange it one time due to a severelly damaged disc that I hadnt even touched.    Overall a great package, a great show.  The extras that are there are good but missing tons of stuff.  The packaging is less than I would want, but go buy this anyway.  If you are careful with the discs, you shouldnt have any problem.    
 "In the preface to this book, Samer Akkach describes his childhood experience of watching snowflakes from his window in Damascus. Looking at them, he had the feeling that the flakes were not falling, but that he was floating upward to higher realms. Reading his book has had a similar affect on me, giving the impression that I have been carried up into unutterably strange, but compellingly beautiful, realms of thought and imagination. In the face of the worldwide homogenization of architectural education, it is salutary to be reminded that architecture wasn't always and everywhere designed solely to satisfy aesthetic, economic, functional and technological exigencies. In many times and places architecture expressed a human sense of the wonder and oneness of the world. Buildings fitted together with myths and cosmologies to convey that people and the cosmos belong together: humans belong in the world they inhabit; and the world belongs together with humans. In this context, buildings serve to mediate between the human as microcosm and the whole world as macrocosm, showing how they inter-reflect and harmonize... Samer Akkach is one of a small band of architectural scholars who see it as their task to record and interpret these other architectures so that they do not sink into irrecoverable oblivion. He rescues Islamic architecture from amnesia. In his splendid book he applies his intimate knowledge of Arabic and the premodern Sufi texts to convey a lucid and richly detailed account of the manner in which Islamic architecture, in all its forms, from buildings to cities, gardens, landscapes and meta-landscapes, reflected the cosmos, and thus gave back praise. The book is masterful, and a major contribution to architectural scholarship... Having relocated the discourse on architectural symbolism in the context of how Islamic (or, more particularly, Sufi) texts view the matter, Akkach then proceeds to give a panoramic view of Sufi thought as it relates to architecture. The view he opens up is so wide and so detailed that it is not possible in a brief review to give an account of the materials he covers, even in summary. It must suffice to say that the work comprises four chapters, each dealing with an aspect of 'order,' respectively the discursive, metaphysical, cosmic and architectural... Akkach looks at concepts that are familiar in the Western literature on Islamic architecture and brings out new aspects, sometimes at variance with the conventional scholarly wisdom on these matters. By reference, for example, to the 'Land of Reality,' the 'Cities of Light' and Ibn Sînâ's 'heavenly landscape,' he brings out previously unrecorded aspects of Islamic orientation, architecture and landscape... This is not a book for those who are used to skim reading... Nor is it for those who tremble in the presence of the unfamiliar. Akkach guides the reader into foreign territories of thought, where everything in the landscape is wholly unlike anything we are used to. In this sense, the shock of the old--premodern antiquity--becomes the shock of the totally new. If the past is a foreign country, then Akkach leads us into a country that is doubly foreign, because as well as being a country of the past, it is a past whose present, contemporary Islam, is equally unknown to many in the West... Akkach's book takes us into realms that, for many readers, will be radically unfamiliar. For those who can deal with the vertigo induced by an encounter with the wholly alien, the book will enhance understanding, to the degree that they will never again see Islam or Islamic architecture in the same way as they did previously. It is also possible that they will never again see Western architecture in quite the same way either."

 Owen Harrison is no longer just the man who wrote the book on Open Space Technology — He’s now the man who wrote the books. Expanding Our Now is Harrison’s second crack at explaining the organizational theory he developed after watching a celebration in an African village. Basically the theory boils down to this: A group will organize itself to solve a specific problem if you sit everyone in a circle and get out of the way. The nuts-and-bolts of this process were described in Harrison’s earlier, Open Space Technology: A User’s Guide. This time around, the author gives us a bit more history and theory. Your reaction to this book will depend to a large extent on how ready you are to accept OST as a concept and how open to new management techniques you are in general. But even if you’re not in the market for newly minted organizational theories, we at getAbstract.com recommend that you read this book, if only to absorb some of its innovative suggestions about how to get the most out of that bane of corporate life — the meeting 
 I always love history fiction books so I thought I would give this one a try. At first it was a little hard to get into but once I started getting into it I couldnt put it down. I thought that the book should have expanded more on Tristian but other than that I loved it. I just ordered the second one and cant wait to continue the story. Hopefully Tristians past is explored more but I have faith that book two will be just as good 
 I am a big fan of Robert Louis Stevenson, and I think that "The Master of Ballantrae" is his best novel.  It has interesting character studies and its exciting story is set in a great variety of locations.  It  has good adventure plus a very haunting quality to it, and is one of those  books that I enjoy re-reading 
 This book is an absolute must if you'd like to avoid the terrible twos stage.  I read this book as well as his other entitled "How to Raise a Happy Unspoiled Child".  I followed his guidlines as best as I could  and today I credit Burton White for how wonderful my five yr old turned out  to be!  My son went through what I call the "terrific twos" and  people comment on his well-behaved and happy disposition all the time!  He  teaches you how to "discipline" appropriately according to age  without inflicting physical pain to the child.  But you must begin by ten  months at the latest.  Starting early is the secret.  Get his books and  begin now for the sake of your child's happiness and maturity.  Good luck 
 This DVD not only provides great entertainment, but it gives you an honest look at Jess and who she is as a person. And not to mention the 5 fantastic music videos, great interviews and other looks at the "pop princess". I highly reccomend this DVD to anyone wanting a closer look at this fantastic performer and person 
 This second Nina Halligan thriller finds the African-American private investigator trying to find who killed and slandered a friend's husband, who was a White House aide. As the investigation becomes more personal, Nina follows the trail to the tiny Caribbean island nation of Misericordia, where apparently the man who killed Nina's husband and children is living under an alias. With her lesbian best friend Anna, Nina travels to Misericordia, where the two find themselves in the middle of a civil war. Kelley's writing is highly compelling and draws the reader quickly into the story with sharp and feisty characters. The ending is a bit of a reach though. And his politics are rather heavily slathered over the story, and sometimes his characters seem to lack depth, but overall I feel this is an excellent political mystery thriller with a great, progressive political slant. It's highly feminist, which is always a refreshing discovery 
 I pride myself on disciplined reading - not getting carried away like an amateur; reading once a year, jamming through a book at break-neck-speed to the end, and then not reading another book until next year. Once, in a while though, I can't help it. I was doing pretty well through the first part of this book, cruising along at a steady pace a little each night. Then the plot tightens, and sings, and pulls you in - tight. Now I'm flipping page after page deep into the next morning.  I got next to no sleep and the next day I was trashed.  It was worth it. It's a raucous fun ride and a great sequel to the first book.  If you like history, technology, politics, suspense, murder, conspiracy and betrayl (who doesn't?), you're in for a treat with this one.  All thumbs up, WAY up!! 
 People will be reading, studying and writing about Kathryn Davis for many, many years. Her work is playful, complex and exceedingly intelligent--incomparably precise. Part Henry James, part Virginia Woolf, completely original. The tone of this novel is so strange and original it is hard to describe, but its caginess is part of its massive appeal. Kathryn Davis will in the future be considered one of our most important novelists without a doubt 
 Book 3 of the Dark Horse Comics reprints of Marvel's Star Wars comics is a fine achievement in itself, and these books have never looked better!  In fact, doing a back to back comparison with this trade paperback and the original comics will shock you as to how much improved these re-colored reprints are!   As for the issues covered in this volume (#39-53), there is a definite improvement in the overall quality:  The art is getting away from the blocky (but well-liked by this reviewer) style of Carmine Infantino, which is still present, but the absolutely gorgeous art of Al Williamson and Walt Simonson is more striking and the characters look more like the onscreen actors from Star Wars.  This is especially evident on the "Empire Strikes Back" adaptation featured in the first six issues of this volume.  The writing gets better with these issues, too.  Archie Goodwin and David Michelinie have always been superb storytellers and they turn in some fine work here.  I particularly enjoyed Michelinie's 2-part "Tarkin" story which blew me away as a ten year-old back in '81.   Mike W. Barr's "The Last Jedi" is another story I liked as a kid, but it's even better and more poignant through adult eyes.  The Dark Horse reprints of the Marvel Star Wars comics are definitely worth getting, especially if you're wary of constantly digging out those old, yellowing copies from your original comic book collection.  I'm so happy that someone saw fit to re-release these comics, which were so important to my friends and I as kids, almost as important as the movies! The Marvel books kept us entertained and inspired us to create our own characters that would inhabit our own small corner of the vast "Star Wars Universe. 
 I remembered loving this movie, and coundn't remember why.  Tonight, I looked online at Amazon to read what folks had said about it, and found a fascinating difference in the reviews.  One the first "page" are 7 reviews.  Here are the Titles of the positive reviews (4.9 ave rating):  Awe inspiring  Good bye -- illusions EXCELLENT MOVIE/Guaranteed to shed a tear!!!,  Out of the box A Must See This movie is about control one of the most important movies ever made  These words from a negative review:  "nature versus civilization is always a rich topic--it's that Instinct boils them down to inane sound bites."  Bottom line: You might love this movie or dislike this movie, but there is something interesting to discover in either case. Those who believe in the premise love it, and those who don't believe in the premise do not.  I've never seen any movie that can better serve as a basis for significant spiritual conversation as this movie can.      
 The product is impressive but it more delightful if a miniature of batman is included. I thought a miniature of batman is included in this product. Well anyway, the product is impressive 
 	The Dead Next Door is another fine addition to the Zombie genre.  If you were to place this in terms of acting and film quality, it would have to fall somewhere between Night and Dawn of the dead, but leaning more towards night.  Apparently this film was shot, written, and  produced by a then 18-year-old Bookwalter, which in and of itself is worthy of a viewing.  The plot needs almost no explaining:  zombies walk amongst us, and their legions are growing.  In this film, however, we get organized zombie squads that work out of D.C. and patrol the nearby neighboring states.  Like in The Omega Man, it is implied that science was the cause and could be the cure for the undead problem.  The storyline itself is both irreverent and cynical, full of stupid people doing stupid things.  One of the best parts is when a group of protesters sporting Let The Dead Walk signs gets attacked by the very creatures they were trying to protect.  There are even zombie cults and zombie sacrifices.  Gore-mongers won't be disappointed either:  the special effects, although coming close but not quite equaling such maestros as Romero or Fulci, are still capable of dropping open the jaw.  DVD extras are very formidable:  interviews, deleted scenes, alternate takes, photo galleries and behind the scenes footage, to name but some of the included treasure trove here.  Shot in suburban Ohio, this is a true independent film and deserves to be respected on that merit.  
 A good reference for those seeking a career change or just starting out.  Unfortunately, two of the top ten rated jobs are computer-related.  These may not be the best jobs to get into at this time.  The current trend in the corporate world is to cut IT spending to the bare minimum.  The apparently ideal way to do this is to outsource programming jobs to inexpensive offshore companies. Fewer computer jobs are available to Americans and those jobs are often much lower paying than they once were.  I wouldn't suggest becoming a programmer.  Consider taking biology classes instead 
 This is absolutely the most precious book. All the craft ideas use items that are easy to find. And the projects are not only easy to make, but a lot of fun. Definitely recommended 
 Gripping.  You can feel the wind and the surf and the tension 
 Exciting and spell-binding. My favorite Grisham novel. I was sorry when it ended 
 I read this book many years ago and it is still as powerful today as it was back then. Mel Tari is a friend of Roland & Heidi Baker's in Mozambique. When I read this book back in 1992 the presence of God filled my room in such a mighty way to confirm that what I was reading was true. You will not be disappointed with this one 
 I can honestly say that I almost peed my pants when I saw this show on DVD. Words cannot describe how much of a batman nut I was when i was younger. I watched every episode of the series religiously every afernoon after school. Every episode was great in my mind, and now I could relive my childhood with this bit of nostalgia. I bought this volume out of the four first just because of the episode list. The packaging is a bit annoying, but with a 4 disc DVD set, it's hard to be really creative. On the other hand its kinda nice with the comic book artwork on the inside. Visually, the  series looks great, but at some points the color is faded. The sounds is really good actually, the best your going to get from a cartoon.   Now for the Important part, the episodes:  Five Star Episodes:  The Trial-My all time favorite due to the presence of almost all of Batman's enemies at one time. The Joker can be seen here in his utmost insanity.  Harlequinade- Another fantastic episode feautring the Joker. He schemes to blow up Gotham with a huge bomb. Batman enlists Harley for some help in seeking the Joker. This leads to a very climactic battle on the backlawn of Mayor Hill's estate!  Terrible Trio- A highly underrted episode only because of the "weak" villains. Actually the villains are some of the most evil.  What can be worse when a bunch of twenty-something rich preppy boys get bored? They start robbing and killing. There's also some great emotional depth in this episode through class distinction and the pain over a family member getting hurt.  Shadow of the Bat (Part 1 & 2)-Quite possibly the best two-parter in the series. There is a ton of mystery, one on one battles, machine gun shootouts, and of course the introduction of Batgirl. Excellent episode(s) and the music is absolutely fantastic as well.

 BE SAFE is a safe gift that I am giving to all my loved ones. It is a humorous approach to many of the kinds of problems that you want to save them from without being preachy 
 "Mal flicked his eyebrows at me once, his only admission to the acute self-consciousness we all feel, regardless of age or station in life, when anyone meets our parents."  This is from Fenno, the narrator of the central, longest portion of Three Junes. It's false - such self-consciousness isn't something we all feel - and it's unworthy of someone who seems to be in his forties. I have no doubt that Julia Glass knows this; I think the passage is there to show us Fenno's solipsism. I spent most of the book annoyed at its main character. Fenno redeems himself in the third and final section, but that's fewer than 100 pages, of more than 350.   It never occurred to me to stop reading, though; I barely thought to take a break. This immature, self-centered man compelled me onward. He isn't thoughtful enough to care about others on their terms, but I cared about him on his. This is a wonderful book 
 Mi pimer contacto con Garbarek fue en 1976, escuche de una sentada los albums (todavia en vinil): DIS con Ralph Towner y FOLK SONGS alternando con Charlie Haden y Egberto Gismonti, para mi fue toda una revelacion, me parecia una musica con un sello especial, de ahi en adelante fui un fiel seguidor de Garbarek, me parece un musico que lo puedes identificar, porque Garbarek solo suena a Garbarek. Pasaron 5 largos anos sin noticias discograficas y ahora me encuentro con IN PRAISE OF DREAMS, la verdad, esperaba una obra mucho mas elaborada, con mas produccion, con mas elementos de novedad (musicos nuevos, sonidos distintos, etc. Me gusta este album pero  la espera fue demasiado larga para el producto que entrega. Tal vez me forme demasiadas expectativas acerca de este album. Salud 
 This is an amazing text that answers almost every question the reader or a patient can bring to the table. Easy to read with good references. This is a must have for anyone who treats lactating women. As a mother I found the book to be very helpful, as a medical professional this book has been an excellent reference when treating lactating women. Definitely 5 stars 
 After reading everything I could get my hands on regarding homeschooling I only wish someone had simplified my journey. The Home School Manual is the ultimate for inspiration, ideas, and the dreaded organization skills that   go hand in hand with home schooling.  If there was only one book I could recommend "newbies" and "wannabees"   to read it would be this book by Theodore E Wade, Jr and others.  It is a simplified version of ideas  and far less overwhelming than the rest.  We have assured that both support groups we belong to have a copy   of this book in there resource center 
 I am so happy that I bought this book. As a recent college graduate who knew next to nothing about anything in the financial realm, I now feel a lot more confident about how to handle my own finances. This book provides an easy to read explanation on things that are actually important to me.   At a 401K meeting we had at the agency I work for, my co-workers and I were so confused about what the presenter was speaking about. We looked up the things that confused us in YF&B and were able to follow the presentation a lot better.  I'm thinking about buying this book as a gift for many friends as they always want to borrow it, but I don't want to give it up. I think it would make a great gift for high school or college graduation 
 I have had this pet chime dog doorbell system for one year. The system I have worked great at its intended purpose. My dog was scratching to let us know when she wanted to go out and when we bought a new house I didn't want the new doorjambs to be covered in scratches. It took about two weeks to teach her to ring the bell consistently without first trying scratching. During this period I had some dog booties that she wore so that she wasn't scratching the wood during the training period. Training her to use it was not difficult. The product worked very well for the first eight months. I didn't have the problems with range from the receiver that some reviewers had with their units. Our receiver was about 15 feet from the furthest "paw" bell. At about eight months the outdoor receiver started to act up by getting stuck when the dog rings it and chiming over and over and sometimes being triggered by rain or wind and ringing repeatedly. Jiggling the paw stops it and it hasn't happened enough yet for us to trash it but seems to be getting worse. I am planning to order one of their replacement transmitter paws for about $12, not including shipping. I think we were fortunate that our unit worked as well as it did, given others comments it seems there is inconsistency in the quality of the product. 
 This cd is worth the price just to hear Mavis Staples belt "Melody Cool" but the other songs are such fresh beats in the inimitable way that Prince turns it out.  It's still good 16 years later. 
 One of the great books of our time this is seemingly a random collection of thoughts, stories and rememberances, all written in Sebald's typical elliptical poetic almost hypnotic prose. Scratch under the surface however and you will find a deep philosophical meditation on memory and death and the beauty we can find in decay. In its own way this book reveals the sorry state of the novel by being simply a huge advance on that tired old form. It certainly doesnt feel like a novel but reads like a non fiction book but really it is beyond such defitnions of genre and rather it is a new catagory of literature upon which catchy names have yet to descend. This book along with Sebald's entire output will come to be seen as a key moment in the history of literature like that ushered by the publication of Ulysis 
 The music on this disk is great for relaxation or putting the worrys of the day to rest 
 Saffo. As you have never seen her before. As a woman, a wise and a passionate soul. We have so little on Saffo that the Historical parts are more on the backbround of the historic age where she lived than on herself. A true history about her with the little things we have would not be possible. But the fiction is really very nice and this is one of my favourite books. I do reccomend this book to who likes this genre. Buy it 
    The Chinese genocide of the Tibetans is one of the most disgusting and disturbing events in modern history, on par with the Nazi treatment of the Jews.  This is doubled by the fact that the western powers did and are doing nothing as members of an ancient civilisation dedicated to spiritual practice are exterminated by the chinese.    There are those who will deny this fact, if you are that ignorant then do not watch this film and write pathetic, twisted comments.      If you are more of a human being then you will enjoy this film.  Far from perfect, the depictions of what Lhasa once looked like before the Chinese invasion are breath taking.  The film shows Tibetan Buddhist monks being shot in cold blood by Chinese soldiers.  This is shocking as it should be.  This is what happened to thousands of monks in 6,400 monasteries.  In the words of the Dalai Lama, 1,200,000 Tibetans have died as a direct result of Chinese occupation policies.    If you view this film and enjoy it, you might want to read of the plight of Tibet by the Dalai Lama himself.  'My Land and my People,' is an excellent book. 
 It's very sharp lens.  You will be wised to use it extensively on little children, they have such clear faces.  Be careful when you use this lens with middle age women.  It could show imperfecton in thousand fold.  Again very sharp, very fast Af focusing on my Nikon F80.  Ecxelent portrature lens, but be careful-women will hate you for unflattering portrature.  My advise use black and white film-you will see less imperfection in prints with the same rasor sharp focus 
 I picked up this book at the local B&N and I couldn't put it down - b4 i knew it I had already read the first chapter at the bookstore and had to buy it!  This is a good book on Ramses II and the period in which he reigned - it's really well researched and the author presents it a well-organized manner.  The author offers some nice descriptions and details about the Ramesside monuments I had not heard before.  It made me want to hop the next plane to Egypt!  It also has a nice list of books of further reading.  I can't wait to pick up Tyldesly's "Daughters of Isis" or her book about Hatshepsut 
 I found it better than the 1954 version. I liked the "leviathan" better than the squid, and the rest was just BETTER 
 If the follow-up to Alanis Morissette's phenominal Jagged Little Pill sounds complex and complicated at times, it's only because Morissette's own set of circumstances were of that fate with having millions of listeners waiting to see what artistic direction the singer was going to pursue next. After finding a greater sense of self-worth and renewed inspiration with her trip to India in 1997, Morissette returned to the music charts in late 1998 with a collection of songs influenced by eastern thoughts, worldbeats rhythms, and psychedelic guitar grooves. She also takes a stab at playing the flute on a couple of tracks, but even  more appealing is how Morissette's own lyrics still flow with her confessional honesty and earnest nature. While the tone of this recording feels a little questionable in the middle with songs that seem too abstract for the average listener to concur with("The Couch," "Can't Not," "UR," and "I Was Hoping")Morissette does bounce back in the end with "Would Not Come" and the songs that follow after. The result is an album unlike Jagged Little Pill but still one consumed with feeling, rawness, purity, and unapologetic emotion. No wonder she's been called by some as a modern-day Carole King.     
 The International Mathematical Olympiad is the premiere mathematics competition for young people. Each participating country selects a team of six and the competition is often fierce. The participants train very hard and obviously are extremely intelligent. They are also very competitive, constantly pushing themselves and their opponents to the limit. The six members of the American team that competed in the Forty-second Olympiad in 2001 are profiled in this book.  Although it will come as no surprise to most math teachers, others will be shocked at the backgrounds of the American participants. They are not stereotypical math-science nerds, in fact, other than their mathematical ability and intense competitive nature; they are quite ordinary teenagers. It is interesting that three had spent at least part of their childhood in the San Francisco bay area, two were from New Jersey and one from outside Boston. With a national pool of over 15 million students to select from, it is amazing to think that the selections would be clustered in this way.   The story of who these kids are, their accomplishments and how they made the team is fascinating. They are existence proofs of a statement that I have heard several times concerning the state of mathematics in the United States. "While the average level of math ability of American teenagers is below world standards, the best in the U.S. are the best in the world." Olson is an excellent storyteller, wrapping the biographies inside the context of their achievements. I recommend this book to all math teachers and they all dream of encountering students like the six described in this book. 
 Never has more true nor more entertaining advice been given!  This book coursing the history of Lon DuQuette's Life with the Spirits will have you in stitches quite regularly, yet he does sneak priceless wisdom in from the side while you aren't looking.  Many people have much maligned Aleister Crowley, a sort of P.T. Barnum of the occult world, but DuQuette succeeds wildly in introducing a different and open-minded side where we can see how Crowley's teachings affect one person and everything they (DuQuette) touch.  DuQuette is indeed a scholar of Crowley, but he is also an insatiable comic.  Who else could come to the conclusion that J-s-s is his mother's yellow dress a such a young age?  If you've read any of his other works, you know you must occasionally suffer him his penchant for allegorical alliteration, it is a petite addiction of his; watch out for those hidden pearls of wisdom.  Indeed, his Chicken Qabalesque theory shines through marvelously -- it's all in your head, you just have no idea how big your head really is.  Waiting with baited breath for the movie.. 
 With this book, Judy Reeves secures her place as the best "writer about writing" we have. In this finely crafted work, as well as in her "A Writer's Book of Days," Ms. Reeves has single-handedly rescued thousands of writers from the fears and insecurities that can cripple even the most talented scribes. If you are serious about writing, wait no longer--BUY THIS BOOK, and write, write, write 
 This is a wonderful book!  Color photos are close up and detailed for those like me who have trouble identifying a piece from black and white small photos!  Great information as to number of pieces produced, etc.  A must have 
 I wish i had known about this book when i was in little league. This has helped me tremendously at the age of 22, and i know it can work for someone of any age. The thing i like most about this book is that it allows for hitters to use their own natural swing.  This is key especially for older hitters who have trouble working out and changing techniques from years of muscle memory.  Read this book once and become a better hitter. In fact, read it every march and you'll be set 
 As the first Depth Psychologist, Ficino really did it up.  Read this book and learn about it.  Then with this wisdom in your back pocket you can go to cocktail parties and no one will want to hear about it.  But you will know that it doesn't matter anyway because one day you will meet someone who does and you will be able to both look each other in the eyes and say... "We're crazy."  And it will be great 
 ...this is it!  If you ever been frustrated by people who love nature but don't understand it, then you will want to join Harriet on her journey of misunderstanding.  Written in the same witty style that we have come to love from Larson, this is a wildely entertaining "children's book" that has me laughing and exclaiming "Amen" at the same time.  The genius of this book is even recognized by Harvard Ecologist E.O. Wilson, author of the forward!  I bought a box of these to give out to all of my friends and family.  Simply put, it is my all-time favorite book!   
 I found the book to be hilarious.  There was so much in it that I had undergone in days gone by when I worked for the devil.  I have been retired 10 years, but this novel reminded me of the crazy things the devil wanted from me--aand how I strove to meet expectations that were ridiculous.  It is great for a laugh.  I read it straight through.  It is well written and fun to read! 
 It wasn't what I expected because there are not many recipes.  However, he explains the rationale behind the mechanics of cooking and tells you how to achieve desired results, which can be applied in any situation.  We are pleased 
 A must have for anyone who enjoys X, The Reverend Horton Heat, or anything else that rides the line between punk rock and country 
 This is a great book about a great ball player.  If you are a baseball fan you will love this book 
 This is one of the funniest CDs I have ever heard.  Some may consider this album insulting to the original artists, but Cheese's "loungization" of each is so perfect that one has to appreciate the time and effort put into the process.  All Cheese albums are technically parodies, but each song is done with such style and precision that it comes off as more of a quirky, left-handed homage to the bands he covers.  This is for those (like me) who love heavy, "alternative" bands, and who don't take their music--or themselves--too seriously 
 I was pointed to this book by a Food Network fan who loves food and thought this was a great story about how people become chefs, why they are passionate about cooking and good food and why the lives of chefs are so interesting. I would certainly agree that the book was entertaining--it was funny and moved along very well, plus I did learn a lot about the restaurant business and what I should look for when I am eating out. It was informative and a good read, so certainly worth reading for people who love cooking and chefs, but also great for people like me who just enjoy a good story that is well told--nothing complicated or too deep, but certainly a good bedside book.   My one complaint about the book is that Bourdain makes all of the characters alpha-male (or female), profane and hard living carcitures, which makes them seem a little unrealistic and not at all memorable, but in the end the book overcomes that flaw and is still very worth checking out 
 I bought this item after reading a glowing review in Wine Spectator magazine.  I love it.  It is low cost, works great, and is very easy to operate, particularly for folks who are challenged by a regular corkscrew.  Just hold it vertically on the top of the bottle, hold the bottle steady, push the button and 5-10 seconds later the cork is out of the bottle.  Push the other button and 5 seconds later the cork is off the opener.  Put it back in the charging stand 
 Although the book is great, it speaks for itself and I'm not here to review it.  I emailed the author, or someone who works with her, at the email address I got from Jan's website.  First of all, a little background.  I have a two-year-old border collie/lab who I've had since he was seven weeks.  I adore him.  I have been working from home with the occasional temp job up until two months ago.  I now work 5 days a week outside the house.  I wrote to this person asking advice on certain things relating to walking the dog, and mentioned the hours my dog is being left alone while I'm at work.  My response was that I am "selfish" and unfit to have a dog.  This coming from someone who was once so clueless about raising dogs that she put one of her own to sleep.  I have been looking into getting a dogwalker for my pooch, which as a person concerned for dogs, she could have suggested.    But her only suggestion was my poor dog, I shouldn't have him.  Whereas the book is a good read with good methods, I would suggest a second thought before asking her or her staff any questions personally.  She, or whoever that was, is rather selective in the dogs she'll help according to what she thinks of their owners.  It was a negative experience trying to get any kind of advice from them.  Rather than pointing out something wrong and offering suggestions to rectify it to someone who is obviously open to change, she chose instead to say, Sorry!  Not interested!  Not at all what I had in mind for someone in her position and with her passion 
 This is a book for the people who no longer hear the ring of the bell -- but if you're in that category (or are just generally fatigued by holiday cheer), then this is for you.  The 18 short stories very in quality but, overall, they reflect bright writing about sometimes depressing holiday happenings.  Leave it in your bathroom at your holiday party and group your guests by their reactions as they leave.  Those with a sense of humor about the holidays will be amused.  Those without (perhaps some of the reviewers here) could be upset.  
 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, was not only a writer: he was a scientist, physician, political activist and an amateur detective himself. Two actual criminal cases same to his attention and inspired him to become involved: these two cases are documented in the True Crime Files Of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for the first time and will represent a 'must' for any avid Doyle reader surprised to find something new 
 bike has very nice detailing, paint has a nice shine, really like the fenders to help keep daughter clean, great buy! 
 I've always considered the novel Friday as the start of Heinlein's `modern' science fiction works.  He wrote his novels I Will Fear No Evil (1970) and Time Enough For Love (1973) in the 70's and The Number of the Beast (1980) followed up with characters from his previous works.  Friday (1982) started out with new and fresh characters and shucked off most of the 60's and 70's feel of the other previous novels (such as the lovey-dovey talk between bedmates, the oft-used term `dear' (though still used), etc).  Although there is still some aspects of it in Friday such four lovers together in one bed.  By the 80's, swinging had pretty much ceased to be a social phenomenon.  For anyone that's a red-blooded male, you couldn't help but notice the book cover if you passed it in a book store.  On it is a pneumatic woman in a tight jump suit zippered down low.  With that though was also a problem, as the term `don't judge a book by it's cover' comes to mind and one then thinks of it as just a pulp novel and not of any good.  So come to my surprise where in this day and age where faery handbags and militant lesbianism passes as award winning SF and I look back to past science fiction works to find that Friday was one of six finalists for the 1982 Nebula Awards and one of five finalists for the 1983 Hugo Awards. It's a brilliant cover telling of the novel, the woman has her sleeves rolled up showing that she's independent and tough, and in the background is a futuristic window on what appears to be a space station or space shuttle overlooking a planet.  In one brief glimpse one's able to tell that this is a science fiction story.   Fortunately the publishers knew this book cover is a classic and have not removed it which they've unfortunately done to other classics, Frederik Pohl's Gateway being one.  It wouldn't be sufficient to say that this novel is about the adventures of Friday because although it is, it uses her actions partly as means to tell of events in the story.  North America is broken up into a series of autonomous regions and a series of assassinations and riots occur within these regions and the inner systems and asteroids.  Sort of a Tet Offensive for the Solar System.  After these events tone down for a while, she's able to meet back up with "Boss", in scenes reminiscent of Charlie's Angels.  Talking about television programs, there are strong similarities between Friday and Cameron's former program, Dark Angel.  There's a genetically modified and enhanced female courier, young and sexy, set within the future where the United States has disintegrated into several countries.    Although Heinlein does use the discrimination against genetically modified persons, or artificial persons (AP) as mentioned in the book, as an allegory on racism, racism is a bit more complex.  It's difficult to consider a male refusing a curvy, sweet, willing woman like Friday whether she's an AP, black, brown, yellow, red, Andorian blue, or Rigelian green.  And for other women to be prejudiced against Friday, it's less likely to be due to her color than to her curviness.  There's not as much sex in the novel as may have been mentioned, certainly less when compared to other Heinlein novels, I Will Fear No Evil topping the list.  Any mature adult should be able to handle the scenes within the novel.  Heinlein does rip into religion so some puritans may be offended.  As with other Heinlein novels, there are sections that drag on, and if you find yourself re-reading the same section, just plow forward, keep reading, and it'll get better.  There are some `hard-core' science fiction sections such as describing that the distances between stars may be further apart than they appear looking up into the night sky on earth.  You either already know this from astronomy or you don't really need to know it to read the novel.  Categorize this novel under `fun'!  Friday, 1982, 357 pages: 3-1/2 star 
 "H. J. Murray's" "HISTORY OF CHESS" is considered by all serious chess historians to be the classic work covering the early development and progression of chess. It is a very extensive and scholarly written work. This book is not intended to entertain the reader with "odd, but true" stories or myths about chess. It is an informative guide and reference book for the serious chess historian. The most extensive work on a more modern history of chess (1800s onward) is "THE CHESS KINGS" by Calvin Olson. However, in addition to being scholarly and accurate, it contains annotated games of historical importance while making the history of the world championship level chess entertaining. Together these books form comprehensive coverage of chess history from its beginnings traced back to around 600 a.d. to the turn of the 21st century 
 If you're a Feeder fan, or maybe you just want to try out Feeder - get this. This collection of singles reflects the past, present and future of the band.  Before I dive into talk, I want to point out this albums' track listing - There's actually TWO CD's in the Limited Edition copy of this album. The Limited Edition (Deluxe), includes a DVD. The DVD has all the songs on the CD, plus some more BUT you can watch them all as music videos!  From "Tangerine" to "Save Us", this really does show changes in the band's sound. Feeder have always been with their unusual guitar riffs...and that's something admirable about Feeder.  From the time of this album's release, "Save Us" is the planned single to be released in the month of July 
 The first three-quarters of this novel are absolutely captivating and "unputdowanably" good.  And yet just when I thought it was about to get even better, Roth shifts gears and peels away another layer of the onion to show us these people and their friends and family through the main character's eyes.  While eventually the story picks up again, this radical shift took away some of the enjoyment for me.  Nevertheless, Roth is his typically, excellent self here, providing great prose, excellent character development and a gripping plot.  The Nathan Zuckerman character doesn't play as much of a role in this novel as he did in, say, The Human Stain.  Here, it's frankly an unnecessary device, even though it doesn't get in the way of enjoyment.  My only quibble is that I was far more interested in Merry, the main character's daughter, than in the range of emotions Swede Levov -- the main character -- experiences.  I wanted to see Merry more, especially as she was doing, seeing, thinking, and ultimately developing into the radical protester she would become.  Instead, it is all given to us second hand, from Swede's discoveries and we experience his emotional turmoil instead of hers.  True to life in that way, I suppose, as few of us really experience the center of the storm.  We mostly hear about others doing so.  Still ... 
 I bough this DVD for a friend and it was in perfect shape when i got it. 
 Gore Vidal's wit and humour sparkle in this tale of a young american boy traveling Europe in search of a purpose to his life. Like Paris, he knows the lures of power, knowlwdge and love, represented by three fascinating women. The characterization and the detailing of the major and minor charachters make of this book a masterpiece, full of wry notations and often exilarating situations. A must read 
 I thought this book was amazing, couldn't put it down once I started.  For people that are interested in Leadership and what it takes to be a good leader this is a must read.  I have read Gates of Fire also and this book is better.  The writing is outstanding and almost puts you in the boots of Alexander.  Highly recommened!!!!!! 
 I first heard of David Kunzle's book through a review written by Angela Carter.  The book puts forward what was a novel argument at the time it was written - namely, that use of the corset and tightlacing was not simply a sign of the social oppression of women, but that it was simulataneously a rebellion against that oppression.  Particularly focussing on the Victorian era, he argues that use of the corset was subversive, in view of the socially sanctioned role for women as sexless 'angels in the house' - tightlacing being overtly sexual, and not seen as consistent with housewifely duties.  He marshals an impressive array of data in support of this thesis, particularly from the vehement anti-feminist opposition.  Fascinating social history - highly recommended 
 Excellent (detailed, timely, and unbiased) source of business information; editorial page, however, is strongly slanted towards the conservative side 
 I have read this book cover to cover and I find it to be LaMothe's best work. The demos alone are amazing, pure software, but yet run in real time. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn the math behind writing 3D engines and anyone that want's to learn from an expert coder of 3D engines the tricks of the trade to make 3D engines without the use of acceleration hardware. Additionally, whomever posted the "nowhere" post is obviously a jealous programmer or competing author. Many of the reviewers have posted their emails, I suggest that anyone that wants to ask other reviewers simply email the people. I hate people that waste time putting up completely useless and obviously vidictive posts without any tangible points to make other than their own obvious attempts at slandering the author.   This book rocks, if you don't think so, pick up a copy at the local bookstore and read it there. Also, there are a number of excerpts here that you can review as well. 
 There is that silly cult movie about wrestling called "Vision Quest" where Elmo (J.C. Quinn) talks to Louden (Mathew Modine) who is not going to wrestle the meanest (you know what) wrestler in the valley, and J. C. Quinn talks about Pele, scoring an impossible goal, on his back, turned the other way, and he tells Louden that for one moment that effort raised the human spirit. Allright. Granted, kind of silly. And Louden eventually beats Shute which is a turnabout as if George Custer won. But don't forget the picture had a very hot Linda Fiorentino which made up for a few gaps in the believability quotient.  Well, anyhow, that's why we watch sports. It's not the Michael Jordon or the Emmit Smith or even (I'm trying to think of a baseball player but the sport is in shambles) . . . , it's Jimmy Valvano at the Wolfback never expecting to win. It's the autistic high school boy who plays in the last game of his senior year and scores more than 20 points in 8 minutes. It's the beauty of the sport, the tension, the pressure, the sadness. Hate to say it, but it really is the joy of victory and the agony of defeat.  I think Feinstein delivers. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury  
 I have read dozens of raw food books and originally adopted a raw food diet to stop my debilitating arthritis.  A raw food diet is powerful: it completely eliminates my arthritis pain.  However, there are days when the lack of arthritis pain is simply not enough: my cravings for cooked food are so unbearable that I need additional motivation.  That's where Tonya's book always delivers.    Tonya's book is motivational, encouraging, informative - like a trusted counselor who is always there to support you. She understands that people have a strong desire to look beautiful. In her book she clearly supports the truth that healthy IS beautiful and explains how a raw food diet leads to fantastically good health -- and therefore, glowing natural beauty.  When so many raw food books address the logical, scientific reasons to maintain a raw diet, Tonya's book appeals to the quiet hope in each of us that we can become healthier, stronger and more beautiful.    I recommend this book for anyone who has a good understanding of raw food diets and wants the motivation to stay on a raw food diet to find their most beautiful self.  
 I began reading this book having just finished a course on Abstract Algebra through my school's math department, and the semester before I took a graduate course on the exact subject.  After taking the math course, I was presented with group theory as if it were some muddled mix of facts, and the course came across as a poorly taught class on number theory. After reading just the first chapter of Tinkham's book, I developed a new, deeper understanding of group theory as a whole. For example, the way that Tinkham presents normal subgroups makes vastly more intuitive sense than the presentation I received in my math course.  The first two chapters alone are probably worth 80% of the book's sale price. The rest is made up entirely of the fact that the book does not piddle around with trivial examples, but genuinely frames quantum mechanics in the language of group theory, and the most important part is that Tinkham does it well.  This book, along with his book on superconductivity, are must-haves for any serious condensed matter person, and this book should be at least read (if not owned) by any physics grad student 
 WB&L's first album isn't quite as memorable as any of Mountain's, but it is still worth picking up. Leslie West dominates the first side(well, back when this album was strictly an lp and had sides...)and my favorites are the title track and "The Doctor". Jack Bruce and his lyricist Pete Brown(whose efforts by this time had become much more obscure than in his Cream days) are more prevalent on side 2. They don't mesh too well with West & Laing's approach and the last half is a bit limp as a result. Overall, though, any Mountain/Leslie West fan should own this 
 yes, well, perhaps not a frenzy, but this is one of my favorite CD because Frank's voice is soothing and lanquid but has a certain verve and humor....like looking across the ocean and seeking the sun sparkles on the tips of the waves.  A very nice compilation and ideal for relaxation that's not overly mellow. Jazzy in that "Girl from Ipanema" way.  Crafty piano and serviceable musicianship is trumped by fine lyrics 
 You don't have to run away to join the circus; Bruce Feiler's done it for you, and has written a wonderful account of what the inner life of the circus is all about.  He discovers a unique subculture and lives the adventure by participating as a clown.  I've enjoyed Feiler's Walking The Bible and Abraham; here is lighter fare that is pure pleasure reading 
 Calleja has the golden voice for the lyric classical-romantic repertoire and he demonstrates it here  with a selection of Italian and French arias, from Bellini, Donizetti and Verdi to Massenet and Offenbach, Bizet and Gounod. Here is a program packed with melodies, which he sang during the past eventful years on the opera stage.  Calleja's voice is supported by  the Academy of St Martin in the Fields in esquisite form under the direction of Carlo Rizzi and in two numbers Calleja is accompanied by Anna Netrebko and Tatiana Lisnic. Joseph Calleja shapes each aria according to the mood implied in the text. His diminuendos are simply breath-taking.  
 By June 1944, there were hundreds of thousands of Allied prisoners in German POW camps, many in eastern Germany.  As the war ground on, Russian forces began threatening the easternmost camps.  The Germans chose to march most of those prisoners west.  It was winter, and the prisoners often had to walk hundreds of miles; many weere in poor condition after nearly six years of captivity.  Allied policy on POWs was in serious disarray, but there was a great concern that SS or other authorities would massacre prisoners or hold them as hostages.  Drawing on first-person narratives and published works, the British authors concentrate primarily on British POWs, secondarily Americans; virtually no attention is paid to the many other Western allies held in German camps.  How the end game played out, the fates of those camps overrun by the Russians, and the general muddle, terror, deprivation, and determination of individual prisoners makes a complex story, and a valuable addition to WWII literature.  Recommended for military and political collections, and public libraries.  Nichol is a journalist, former RAF flier who became a POW during the first Gulf war, and author of Tornado Down.  Rennell is a journalist and author of Last Days of Glory 
 I found this book right on about reasons for cutting and great insights into why, when, etc. adults cut themsleves. It is non-judgemental and is great for cutters and therapists and loved-ones to read if they really want to understand. It was the first time I ever felt like I wasn't totally alone with this horrible secret and the first time I felt like someone understood and wasn't judging me for it 
 Anyone who is a fan of animation knows the Looney Tunes.  The Warner Bros. animation department developed and created so many memorable characters and cartoons, which have inspired many in the entertainment business.  This book covers many things in a light hearted and enjoyable way and is well worth having in your personal library.  The art of hand drawn cel animation is a dying art, in today's production world of computer animation.  But the principles of cel animation are important for any animation artist.  While there are many books which focus on the technical aspects of animation, there are very few which focus on the principles which make it an art.  If your want to learn and understand what can make animation great, then you will find some valuable things in this book.  
 An inspiring and well written book that takes the guess work and mystery out of creating your own fabrics.  Mickey's style is user-friendly, approachable and encouraging.  The illustrations are good and Mickey's own fabric creations will inspire the reader to try their hand at this art form.  I highly recommend this book 
 Ichiro, the main character in John Okada's novel, "The No-No Boy", is put an a very unusual situation - because of his past decisions a lot of his peers do not accept him as Japanese or American.  John Okada does a brilliant job of getting the reader to empathize with the Ichiro's struggle to find direction after being held in an internment camp (jail) for two years.  His mother is happy he made the decision to refuse service in the United States Army, his brother believes him a coward, and his father has turned to whiskey for comfort from the constant tug-o-war created by war.  He has friends who have sacificed more than he, but are satisfied with his decision to not go to war, and he has friends who never tasted true battle but despise him for not doing so.    At times, I was getting bored with Ichiro's constant whining about his predicament, but Okada did a good job of easing up the saga when it was almost too much and then bringing it back when necessary.    It must have been difficult to try and live in a country that believed you had to prove your loyalty because people who looked like you had attacked your nation of birth.  This novel does a good job of making one think about the struggles Japanese-American went through before, during, and after the war.  Okada manages to create dialogue that is not so predictable it becomes a too easy of a read.  He keeps the characters in this novel above the routine writing style of most authors.    This book is easy to read, thought-provoking, and contains enough fictional and non-fictional information to make for an entertaining novel.  See ya next review!      
 I don't know about you, but I'm not a fan of large books.  His presentation is terse, and very readable.  I bought this for self study and was initially concerned with the lack of solutions.  But as I continued my studies I actally found it aided learning,  I stuck through problems that I would have normally just looked up the solutions for.  If you want to teach yourself, its length and writing style is for you.  My only complaint is the lack complex analysis,  he does however present you with some of the basic results as exercises.  
 I purchased four copies of this CD as gifts for my nearest and dearest.  They all love it, some because they remember Vince Guaraldi from the 60s and one because she was raised in our home where the Peanuts gang, brought to life with Guaraldi's music, was as cherished as good jazz. There was a great article about Guaraldi in the Arts section of the 12/10/06 Washington Post which triggered this purchase. Give this music to someone special. 
 Glamorous Life was her breakthrough and biggest hit, but this is her most complete album, offering a fuller range of songs. And of course with Prince's help on Love Bizarre and Yellow, it's all the better. Love Bizarre was a classic and her last real big hit. I haven't listened to this album in years, after buying this CD I never realized how much of an influence Prince had on her and how much she copied his style (to be expected). Shame her 3rd album was very incomplete, didn't keep the hits coming, and flopped, but this CD is a clear must buy for any Prince / Sheila E. fan!! 
 This is a great book about the post office and how mail is sent.  The book is very comprehensible and understandable to most students.  Very informative without being dense.  
 My son and I watch LOST together, one or two episodes at a time, on DVD to avoid commercials and to keep the plot continuity that is hard to do when you are watching weekly on TV.  After we finished Season One, we didn't think it would be possible for Season Two to match it.  However, it did not disappoint.  It's hard to write a review of LOST without throwing in spoilers, but I'm going to try to give the essence of Season Two without ruining any of the secrets.  Season Two finds the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 uncovering more secrets about 'The Others'.  There are additional characters.  I won't say where they come from, but be prepared for a shock.  Each LOST character carries personal baggage, has what might be called a tragic flaw, and in Season  Two, these flaws begin to get larger on some and to be overcome by some.  Also, some characters deviate from what makes them good and become almost bad.  The writing and acting are outstanding.  It never ceases to amaze me how much of the acting on LOST is not spoken.  The characters give 80% of their communication and clues about themselves through the way they react before speaking, or their body language, even such little things as a raised eyebrow.  This minimalist dialog requires great acting, and the LOST cast is one of the best.  They certainly justify what must be a gargantuan payroll for the producers.  There are more twists and turns on Season Two than Season One, which had to spend more time on character development.  Be prepared to go back and see flashbacks from Season One in more detail, or from the angle of another person, and also be prepared for sequences that cross levels of consciousnes--some where you think the character is dreaming, but isn't, and some where you think the characters are acting, but are dreaming.  Great color, sound, location, scripting, acting, suspense.  Highly recommended.  Five stars 
 although i acted as a consultant for this book and thus had some familiarity with its contents before publication, i was pretty unprepared  for how beautiful and effective the finished product was when it arrived in  the mail.  It's a jewel, from its restrained and lyrical cover photo to its  soulful content --poems, stories and essays by teenage boys from around the  country.  My personal faves include Fred Brown's "The Bus Stop,"  a choppy, minimalist anecdote about a neighborhood domestic altercation  with a knockout last line worthy of Hemingway or Raymond Carver; Rigo  Landin's "Ode to My Hair Tail," in which a carefully-tended  object of personal adornment becomes, in the final stanza, a spiritual  offering; Kenny Weiss's "I Hate School," a brilliant all-out  assault on verbal decorum and the social rules it helps to maintain; Seth  Chappell's "Does My Mother Look Like This?", a wistfully  speculative love-poem to THE most important missing person in the world;  and countless others.  This book is an activist intervention into all the  current talk by "experts" *about* boys; it short-circuits all the  static of debate by bringing boys' creativity and soulfulness to the fore  and letting them speak for themselves.  Already the book is being used in  group-home workshops to inspire boys in serious need of speaking and being  heard; I can't think of a better affirmation of its power than this, its  use as a tool against despair and creative waste.  Few books achieve such a  perfect harmony of artistic and social value. This book is where it's at,  and I'm happy to have had even a small role in its development.  (If you  think this review represents a conflict of interest, check out the book and  judge for yourself! 
 This book is superb for a number of reasons but the meticulous research behind it really stands out. There is not an idea or suggested proposition that is not referenced to one - and sometimes - mulitple sources. The tentive conclusions that are laid out are suggested only after exhaustive research and tightly  logical arguments.  It is not just the research and the logic, however, that makes this book so good. The book is well written and conveys the difficult subject matter of emerging, infectious diseases in a highly readable but detailed and informative matter.   The book is also laid out in a very logical fashion. In different chapters it covers everything from the etiology of new diseases to methods of transmission to social and cultural factors involved in their spread to the drama of in-field investigation of new and fiercely lethal pathogens.  The book also explores the most recent research on the evolution of new diseases, with discoveries that may portend revolutions in the understanding the natural world.  In short, this is an indespensible work for anyone wishing to understand the emergence of new diseases and cutting edge science in the modern world 
 This book was excellent. Joe Montana will transform his winning spirit to you through these pages. It is a great book which will help you to use the winning strategies of a sports team in your own life. Anyone who desires to succeed will be encouraged by what is written on the pages in this book. I shared this book with a couple friends because I felt that some of the things written in it would bring inspiration into their lives. They both agreed that it was very good. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with one 
 As an author and professor of media communications and culture at NYU, Mark has an impressive track record of examining the media power-of-suggestion stranglehold on individuated and collective reality. Or, "unreality." The work he did in one of his earlier books, "Boxed In," regarding television-induced culture, is brilliant, and in some ways reminds me of author Harlan Ellison's scathing critiques of TV-lunatic reality which were essembled in two volumes as "The Glass Teat," the title devilishly makes the perverse comparison of the nutritional intake of suckling infants and an uncritical, desensitized populace feeding off of the lies and razzle-dazzle of television. Ellison quickly found his way to Reagan/Bush's list of "subversives."  That aside, however, Mark's book, "Cruel and Unusual: Bush and Cheney's NWO" gets to the true heart of the matter and does so in with a clarity that apparently isn't easily accepted by many, including those who see themselves camped in the 'left'.  The crux of fully understanding the dilemma of the right wing strains which now menace not only our country but the entire planet, rests in avoiding or denying the magnitude of the threat. Mark correctly points out how those who comprise the mainline media are complicit to what has happened in as much as it is through those very institutions which has come an intentional and strategically foisted Orwellian false consciousness which enshrouds the collective perceptions of what the true right wing agenda is.   The right wing movement is, in psychological terms, projective, meaning, if you took away the movement's need and desire of imputation, attack ad homonym, shout down and hate others, nothing would remain. Naturally such a radically venomous movement needs to cloak itself within seemingly morally upright guises of patriotism and "God is on OUR side!" [Although, I should add, Mark's book is NOT an attack on religion, religious beiefs, or liberal Christians]  It's helpful to bear in mind that, often times, spiritually and mentally ill people[who just as often may appear 'normal' and healthy to those likewise afflicted with similar defiencies]can not and will not be capable of empathy, sympathy, humility, or contrition. Sound familiar of the Christ-o-fascist Bushies?  In simplistic terms, crazy people don't know they're crazy. They'll often never question their sanity, and are, by nature of their illness, unable to even fathom the idea.  This is why the right wing has spent vast sums of money for ideological, cultural/institutional warfare since the early 1970s; to ensure that nothing like what happened in the counter-culture era ever happens again. Power, be as ill and spiritually deficient as it is, given how unconscionablity, hostility and aggression become exalted properties to and for power/belief structures which define success and the intrinsic worth of existence in cold, materialistic terms, only seeks to exert itself; to make everything and everyone think, appear, value and behave as it does.   That way, even in sickness, power 'wins'[which has greater value than does harmony and compassion for sick people] as it has fewer and fewer opponents i.e. "enemies." This is why this right wing projective movement has long refered to itself as "compassionate." As they've secured more of the "reality" sold via media[through corporate consolidation]the framework has shifted further to the right, enabling for fewer people to discern propagandistic "compassion" and true, actual deeds, actions and acts of compassion. It's so grotesquely perverse now that there are people who can see the murder and rape of others as being "compassionate," of paving the way for even further acts of liberation, altruism and "democracy."   Another example, notice how the word "liberal" and the basic tenets of human liberation have been so effectivly maligned, how this perversion has been fostered within and taken root within the collective psyche. Amazing.  Mark's book offers an excellent starting point in defining the process, of being familiar with the modes of thinking outside of the media-induced unreality, of finding the common language to acknowledge and properly address. Afterall, much of the problem, or, the lack of concern to address the problem in all due emphasis, isn't that people are generally stupid or in favor of deceptive rhetoric that disguises evil deeds, but that they exist within a social climate that has been poisoned by media, which is basically man-made atmosphere/weather.   It's an oversimplistic hypothesis, but think of the collective conscious/unconscious as a computer program, okay, ..now, concede that someone IS quite capable of introducing a virus into that program. Who stands to benefit?  Check out Mark's blog: http://markcrispinmiller.blogspot.com/  I'm also looking foward to reading his latest book, "Fooled Again: How the right stole the 2004 election..."  Also watch for his off Broadway play[now on DVD]"A Patriot Act." Here's an interview with Mark at Buzzflash: http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/04/07/int04037.htm 
 Particle Hunters goes into enough detail for me, a mechanical engineer, to understand appropriately.  It has just about the right amount of history to support the details of the particle's development.  I found the book at the  library and checked it out and read it.  Now I am going to be buying it  soon for a reference 
 A very good book, and a good read.  What tipped me off was the following, from the Library Journal, written by Maryse Breton:  Library Journal Jensen (child psychiatry, Columbia Univ.) aims to help parents solve problems encountered when dealing with the professionals who work with children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); he wants readers to realize that doctors, teachers, therapists, and insurance companies should work for them. Acknowledging the limited resources of some and the unwillingness of others, Jensen provides solid tips and a great deal of information based on his practice, his experience as a parent of a child with ADHD, and input from many other parents. The author's experience on both sides of the fence gives the book strength and authority, as do the extensive appendixes listing resources, organizations and books, sample letters, and an example of a school accommodation plan for children with ADHD. While Russell Barkley's Taking Charge of ADHD, Revised Edition: The Complete, Authoritative Guide for Parents helps readers understand ADHD, Jensen's book assists them in getting the best care possible. Highly recommended for all public libraries. Maryse Breton, Ann Arbor, MI Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information.  
 Tim's career had built up momentum steadily. His first album made little impact. His second (Not a moment too soon) contained the single Indian outlaw. It sold extremely well and the next two albums (All I want) consolidated Tim's growing reputation. This album was something else again, propelling Tim's career to even greater heights. Tim began as a traditional country singer but by the time this album came along, he had moved firmly into the contemporary country music scene. You can't blame him as his debut album (a very traditional album) flopped. On the other hand, Tim's voice is country to the core so even when the backing is contemporary as on this album, there is still something of a country feel to the sound.  The album contains plenty of country hits including the title track, Where the green grass grows, For a little while, It's your love (with Faith Hill, otherwise known as Mrs McGraw) and Just to see you smile. As befitting a man at a blissfully happy time of life whose marriage was still fresh and exciting, the album is full of songs about the joys of life, particularly love. Among the tracks not already mentioned, I particularly like Hard on the ticker and I do but I don't.  This album is a masterpiece if contemporary country. Tim has had plenty of success with subsequent albums but I'll be surprised if he ever again matches the sheer brilliance of this album 
 Despite its 1996 copyright this is a great resource!  After reading several books on nutrition and cancer this is the one I continue to use for ongoing reference.  It is not an easy read but explains thoroughly the physiology and chemistry of food components and nutrients.  This is a very useful guide and far more helpful than any other resource I've read, including "Beating Cancer with Nutrition" by guru P. Quilin 
 I agree with another reviewer, it had such an abrupt ending and I was disappointed by this. I really did want it to keep going! It kept my attention and I felt the historical references were interesting, though I am not by any means a historical buff so I do not know what of it is true 
 In 2001 as a sophomore in college, I read Richard Ford's short story "Communist".  It was in the anthology we purchased for the class, and may have been in the "Rock Springs" collection.  I was enthralled with the story and the author's sheer writing ability; if ever I read an author and thought "natural talent", Ford would come to mind.  However, I never quite got around to reading "The Sportswriter".  I flirted with it, picked it up at the library a couple of times, but never made the commitment to actually read it.  Ford has a nice house in the Maine town that I live in, and it just so happens that two summers ago -- while I was working for a landscaping company -- I did a lot of work on his house.  While I mostly dealt with his wife, I did have one short talk with him.  I told him that I loved "Communist", but perhaps he thought I was pandering.  I've read more than any person I've ever met, though, so it was actually high (if perhaps worthless to him) praise.    I have just gotten around to re-reading "The Sportswriter", and finished it this afternoon.  What to say about it?  Complicated.  I find it complicated in any number of ways, though I was once again struck by Ford's astounding ability to simply write eloquently.  I'm talking on a very basic level, and by that I mean the nuts and bolts of the story -- which is precisely why I called him a natural talent.  Very rarely will he amaze you with a striking image, which is to say that he is not a writer whose work is infused with imagery.  What he does do is get inside the head of his narrator, and enclose himself -- and by connection, you, the reader -- into the thoughts and observations of Frank Bascombe.  Bascombe is, thankfully, quite an interesting fellow, and Ford's writing makes for a book easy enough to read -- even though it's mostly just internal dialogue.  Certainly a book made up mostly of relatively unimportant observations is not life changing, though I do believe it to be life-affirming.  Frank never seems to get too riled up about anything, and neither does "The Sportswriter".    Are you going to be blown away?  Will it change your life, will you cry, will you be inspired?  I sort of doubt it.  Perhaps.  I'm certain it's like nothing you've ever read, and I'm also certain that -- like "Communist" -- it's pretty damn good.  
 my 3 year old daughter loves this puzzle!  The pieces are sturdy and the picture is just complicated enough for her to put together.  I think this is a great puzzle for preschoolers.  
 I have the Inner Sanctum Edition Translated by Louise and Aylmer Maude  1942.  Also mine has a great forward by Clifton Fadiman.  It is very old, but from my understanding of others who have read several translations, the Inner Sanctum Edition is one of the best.  I had to review this book.  Obviously it is a very long work, but not the least bit boring.  If you are into war history especially the Napoleonic Wars, this book mixes fiction and historical fact that blends into the classic novel that stands out to this day as one of the best of all time.  Tolstoy takes great care in character development and setting mood.  I plan on reading this translation one day soon to compare it with mine.  Great story, great insight into early 19th century Russian and European politics.  Colorful Characters, especially Pierre "Count Bezukhov who was a man far ahead of his time.  Also there was a Russian movie made base on the novel.  It is about 4 or 6 DVDs, but It really stands true to Tolstoy's work. 
 While this is not the best study Bible I have ever used, it can give a fresh perspective on God's Word that you may not get from reading your old reliable through for the fifth time.  The articles are excellent and complement the text well.  It is a bit massive and one arm may be longer than the other when you return home from church.  It is suitable for use as a (defensive) weapon 
 Heard FOR LOVE OF THE GAME by Michael Sahara, a posthumously published baseball novel by the Pulitzer Prize winning author of THE KILLING ANGELS . . . you might have to dig some to find it, but your search will be worth the  effort.  This is a short, surprisingly moving tale of an aging baseball superstar who is pitching the last game of the season . . . through a series of flashbacks, you learn about his career and the one woman he loves (but who is leaving him).  The writing is compelling, and it makes you feel that you really get to know the guy . . . plus, it has you rooting for his every pitch and caring about what happens to him.  There's a great ending, too. 
 I love this movie it's about a guy name davy stone (adam sandler) who can't stand the holidays all he loves to do is drink beer and get introuble with the law by wreaking havoc around the small town of dukes berry. I can't stand the holidays either working on xmas eve and dealing with annoying costomers that's what this movie reminds me of. usually I spend my pay on strawberry vodka or 12 pk beer after work especially xmas I don't know mabe I hate xmas ah I don't care 
 I first read this book when I was 16 and starting to look at colleges. When I read it I knew that one day I'd want to be a Delta. I then read the book again when I went to college at the beginning of my sophomore year after I saw the Delta's on my campus and what they were doing and I grasped a lot more of the history of the organization and all that was done to make it the best organization. Now I read this book as a member and it's a constant reminder of the legacy of the 22 founders of my sorority. The book is full of history and it gives a Delta perspective. It is far from being an easy read but it provides a wealth of knowledge in it

 Konrath's debut novel gave me a few hours of enjoyable reading, and if that's what you're looking for, then this book's for you.  The characters aren't wildly original, but there's plenty of humor, some good police procedural parts, and very tight writing that doesn't waste space with unnecessary clutter.  Apart from the absolutely horrible caricatures of the FBI agents, there isn't much to dislike here.   I'll be back to read the next book.  It's not literature, but it's fun 
 I am only giving 4 stars, because i just receive it through mail a couple days ago. So i still haven't get a chance to fully try out everything. But I can tell you this camera is very handy, it's very small that i can throw it in my small purse (my purse usually don't have much room, b/c i would already had so much stuff in it, like my PDA, i-pod, cell phone, wallet, keys, a pack of tissue and et.c) and take it with me to anywhere. I love the design of this camera, it's very cool. Pictures are pretty clear, even the one taking during the nights. Another thing that i love about this camera is that it's not noisy, and it's very quick (i have no patience, so it's good for me that i can snap pictures crazy quickly). Overall, I find this camera pretty good. 
 Building on his impressive work at Ars Technica, Mr Stokes has written an informative, well presented guide to chip design and operation that was more than comprehensive enough for this reader.  
 I laughed out loud while I read this book. I was surprised that it is so slim, yet each story is packed with humor. The reader cannot help but enjoy the Professor's adventures in the crazy academic world of Philology. This is a great book to take with you if you will only have the chance to read in short sips or if you only have time for one more story before bed- just make sure you close the windows so the neighbors don't complain about the laughter 
 I enjoy reading books based upon Business like themes, and I must say that this is one that has completely stood out from the rest that I have read. I recently started my own business after 20 years of experience, and I must say that this book covers not only all the basic methods to start a business, but also to make it shine amongst the rest. It is practical and brilliant at the same time, and very easy to follow for anyone who has the motivation to start their own business. Pave your way to success and climb to the top, using this book as an essential tool 
 This book tells the story of a regular bedtime routine, simply worded and with bright, colourful pictures. My 2 year old loves it and can easily describe what is happening on each page 
 John Thomson's photographs come alive in this reprint of his book Street Life in London, originally published in 1877.  While the pictures present a striking view of the city's inhabitants, it is the commentary by Thomson  and Adolphe Smith that draws you inside the lives of those Londoners who  made their living on the streets.   From cabmen to shoe-blacks, from  ginger-beer makers to chimney sweeps, the reader is swept along from one  fascinating career to another.  However, while the past may be fascinating  to you and I, to the people forever captured by the camera it was a daily  battle just to get by.  Thomson and Smith have eloquently combined words  and photographs to create a stark and haunting view of the day-to-day  existence of those Londoners trapped by birth at the bottom of the  Victorian social ladder. 	         The book is a stunning achievement,  a piece of the past exposed.  It fills a void and is a welcome complement  to other books on the Victorian era 
 Nasser died at 52.  During the last year of his regime he looked a haggard person who walked as though he would faint at any moment.  In his thirties 'Fear' was never a predominant factor influencing his decisions. The people, though, had not been responsive enough to keep pace with Nasser's ambitions for progress and improvement. The man was a 'workoholic'- 18 hours per day. Nasser was firm (but not a dictator). He did not use his 'office' for personal benefits - conflict of interest -neither for him nor for members of his family. He's a soldier to the fingertip and, therefore, had a thorough vigilance of the 'politicians', but the dead hand of bureaucracy lingered on.  After the 1967 six days war with Israel, Nasser was emotionally devastated.  It was the feeling of impotence and frustration, that he could do nothing, which made the condition of his health so awful.  I believe the author should have elaborated the above points more forcefully.........    
 I enjoyed Judith's take on a story, that has been told in the past, immensely. The characters came alive and the chemistry between them was exceptional. Her choice of words put me in their world. So what if a similar story has been told, a good book is in the way the story is delivered. Great Job 
 It is important to also look beyond the 8 points of this book to its overall meta messages: *Today, the CEO on-board process is a relative manageable and predictable process *During this process a variety of individuals have specific roles and objectives to ensure the CEO's success *There are specific, transferable skills and experiences to get in preparation for the CEO job *More Boards then ever are flexing their newly acquired, legislative muscles. This has resulted in a tremendous amount of CEOs firings. A more cost effective solution would be for Boards to prevent these firings by providing the CEO adequate pre- and on-boarding support.  It is correct that, in their most summarized form, these eight points have been written about in literature since centuries. Yet, messages such as these are worth repeating two hundred fifty million times (that is approximately how much it has cost to replace seven top CEO in the last three months) as long as this keeps occurring: *New CEOs make unnecessary mistakes *Boards fire CEOs they only hired a year ago for mistakes which could have been prevented with adequate guidance and counsel *Boards react ("Well, we needed to fire him/her because of mistakes") instead of plan and execute pre-emptive solutions   
 This DVD has tons of big name professional poker players telling various stories and giving some tips here and there. There is some entertainment value here to see Negreanu and Ivey before they became poker superstars.   I enjoyed the DVD very much and it has a long running time of about 3 hours, so you get plenty of interviews and information. This DVD will not make you a great player, but it might motivate you to try to become a great player. Hearing world champion players tell you how to make it in the poker world is interesting and helpful. Their advice is incomplete and you would need to search many of the good poker books to fill in any gaps in stuff you don't understand if you are a new player, like playing position, starting hands, etc.   Overall, you have numerous poker players talking poker. If it appeals to you to hear Scotty Nguyen, T.J. cloutier, Phil Ivey, Daniel Negreanu..and on and on, then this would be a great DVD to add to your collection. If you are looking for a DVD to teach you how to play poker or you are a new player seeking information, I would recommend one of the Howard Lederer DVDs for that. 
 Atheism has long been a misunderstood concept. Primarily, Christians, but other religions as well, have shaken their heads disapprovingly at Atheist because they just can't understand why a person wouldn't believe in their personal invisible friend. David Mills works to combat the faith-minded individual with facts. This book is a must for anyone interested in facts and reason. And for the Christians, it might give you an insight into why Atheists believe in themselves instead of theology. 
 At the ripe old age of 30-something a woman has to say good-bye to her maiden consciousness, of the young girl and younger time. There is no guidebook for this rite of passage, but this collection of personal tales are an indication that - the 30's are the decade to pull it all together what you have learned of who you are before 29 ... and making stepping into your own 
 Joseph Felser is a wise teacher of philosophy who does not buy into the rigid modern pursuit of reasoned examinations of our place in the universe, particularly when it comes to questions of religion. He connects with nature to know his place in the universe, observing that we all know how to do this -though many in our culture have neglected this connection for so long that we have forgotten we are ourselves a part of nature. He calls this a state of `metaphysical malnutrition' (p. 50) and observed that earlier in his life, when he could not even identify the source of his inner hunger, he tended to satisfy himself with more familiar junk foods.  He notes that through being in the flow of beingness we connect with our spirituality.  Suggesting that he is a canary stuck in a mine - along with you and me - he announces that he is singing out a warning about our insensitivity to the degradation of the world around us "If I can do it, so can you. Paradise is only a pain away." (xxxi)  Felser advocates for spiritual awareness that is alive and questioning, for it is through the questing and inquiry that one comes into real, personal awareness of the transcendent.   Felser has a wonderful gift for presenting complex concepts through simple imagery and metaphors, helping the reader experience some of the delight in nature and in the transpersonal that he himself obviously has developed.  This book is a thoughtful and enjoyable read, with stimulating quotes that open doors into further reading 
 This book is absolutely fabulous. It has everything, Love, action, danger, humer, history, romance!  I could not put this book down and my husband even wanted to know what was happening (and he hates books).  This book also has the most tender storie that occured durring wwII. I have to get the rest of these books 
 This is a great edition of this great piece of music.  It one of the only full and true editions for the piano.  It's a challenge that's for sure.  But I'm very happy about my purchase 
 After all that is been said, I can only add one more positive review. What I like about this movie is that I can see a more modern look at Germany today, an image different from the usual macabre-war-related made by hollywwod. This movie has a human touch and an open heart 
 Director:  Mike Newell Cast:  Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, Anne Heche, Zeljko Ivanek, Gerry Becker, Robert Miano. Running Time: 127 minutes Rated R for some strong graphic violence, pervasive strong language and brief nudity and sexuality  While the early to mid 90's had a slew of mafia films, "Donnie Brasco" stands out. With its rich screenplay and strong performances, 'Donnie Brasco' is a good film that ultimately is more about the friendship between two people rather than the mafia. Joseph D. Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an excellent FBI agent who goes undercover in the 1970s New York mob as diamond salesman Donnie Brasco. His lead man is Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), an aging and somewhat of a lowlife gangster who sees his chance for redemption in "Donnie". Pistone's wife, Maggie (Ann Heche) doesn't know much about her husband's career and soon their marriage begins to get rocky as he spends more and more time undercover, eventually seemingly one of the mafia's own. Also playing a central role in the story is Sonny Black (Michael Madsen), an up and coming gangster who seems to be getting more respect than Lefty. As the plot develops, Pistone loses himself in the role of Brasco and forms a true bond with Lefty. To his knowledge, and to the knowledge of his fellow mafia members Donnie is a trustworthy gentleman, and the friendship between Lefty and Donnie only increases. Lefty is clearly a degenerate, he constantly mumbles and complains about the poor treatment he gets from mafia chieftain Sonny Red (Robert Maino), and also is constantly asking people for money. He forms a true friendship with Donnie as he tries to gain some altitude back, and as he sees Black getting higher and higher than he does. Soon, the situation begins to escalate as the FBI begins to close in on Pistone's case, and Pistone must make a difficult decision about what he should do with Lefty, whom he has formed the true bond with.  Paul Attanasiano ("Quiz Kids") based his screenplay on the novel of the same name by the real life Pistone and Richard Wooley. While the novel is a clear autobiography of sorts, the film has no narration. Instead the narrative is made clear by Attanasiano's script as he blends the life of Pistone and of Brasco, two separate characters who eventually become one. His screenplay is dynamite. Many mafia films showcase tough guy dialog, but in the instance of "Donnie Brasco" this dialogue serves a higher purpose. The conversations and the actions between Lefty and Donnie form a true relationship, despite their opposite professions. There are also some magnetic scenes of drama and brutal violence, especially at a Japanese bar when Donnie doesn't want to take his shoe off. While some background characters may seem like the typical mafia lowlifes, the simple characterization of Lefty and Donnie is pure magic. Director Mike Newell, who's previous list of credits include the comedy "Four Weddings and a Funeral" brings appropriate direction to the film. This film is not necessarily about the mafia at a certain time like "Goodfellas" or "The Godfather" is, but rather more of a relationship film, showing the way two men come together despite their circumstances. Also very worthy of mention is talented composer Patrick Doyle's musical score, which adds to the emotional effect of many scenes. The performances by Pacino and Depp, as usual, are fantastic. Pacino is given a real chance to shine as the aging Lefty, a man unlike his charismatic character in "The Godfather" series. Depp once again displays his ability to simply submerge himself completely in a role, and as an added bonus the character acts, adding on layers.  The fresh screenplay, strong acting, and sharp direction make it very worthy of mention and, while it at times gets too slow, or the story sometimes loses focus, it still is a very worthy film of watching.  
 Props to Adrian Grant for this Book.

 Carson's commentary on the Gospel of John is thorough and a great aid.  He addresses opposing views on certain topics and gives great insight on difficult passages.  While academic, this commentary can be of tremendous use to anyone who is either leading a Bible study on John or wants to have some help during personal devotions 
 The printer arrived as promised and following the simple set up instructions, I was able to print my first document in less than 20 minutes.  The print quality is outstanding! For home office or home use, this printer is a great value for the price 
 After the Joy Luck Club, this is probably my favorite of Amy Tan's novels. It was interesting and a page-turner. Tan's writing style has you looking at the novel from two points of view, Ruth and LuLing (mother and daughter), which gives the novel dimension. I highly recommend this novel, though it is sad in parts. 
 another great book by Stuart, i look forward to many years of good reading from him 
 Sometimes the journalist comes to the story; sometimes the story comes to the journalist. This time the story came to Pete Earley, and it wasn't pretty.  "Crazy" is one of the kinder words Earley could have used to describe what he found in his investigation of the intersection of the mentally ill with the criminal justice system.  Earley's own discovery of the failed social system began for him the way it began for many of us: when our child's psychosis made a seemingly inevitable collision with the police.  The difference between Pete Earley and most of the rest of us is that he is a former Washington Post reporter, who is able not only to articulate his own experience but to observe, probe and report on the experience of others and to collate into comprehensive form the facts and figures that show that his experience, and that of his son, were the norm, not deviations from it.  Earley's book consists of three separate but interwoven strands:  the story of his son's experience of criminal justice for the mentally ill, accounts of mentally ill individuals in Miami whose lives Earley documents, and research that reveals the systemic mistreatment of the mentally ill, sadly done in the name of individual rights.  Not to give away details better told by Earley than me, this mistreatment includes mentally ill prisoners being kept naked in practically refrigerated cells while awaiting trial.  Other mental ill prisoners cycle through a Kafkaesque procedure in which after a court hearing they are sent to a mental hospital to be made "competent to stand trial," which usually means being compelled to take medication to treat their illness.  They are then returned to the jail where they are not required to take the medication, being held there long enough that they decompensate to the degree that they are no longer "competent to stand trial."  So, back they go to the mental hospital.  This circle of futility spin multiple times and last for months, even years.  Many of us may know the answer to the trivia question: "What institution in the United States houses the most people with mental illness?"  (Answer: the Los Angeles County Jail.)  And while we know that sounds bad, what many of us haven't known is how bad jail conditions really are for those individuals who happen to be afflicted with particular diseases of the brain,  that is, those called mental illness.  Earley's own story gives a sample of some of the personal anguish that family members and loved ones experience, while the people whose lives he chronicles show that his experience was neither unique nor extreme.  Earley puts faces on the facts and souls behind the statistics that are painful enough when they are anonymous.  He shows that the systematic mistreatment he documents is not at all the exception but the rule -- and what a sad set of rules they are.  Crazy is not a book for the squeamish or the faint of heart, and definitely not for those whose parents, children, brothers or sisters are themselves mentally ill, and whose experiences have already left them in serious emotional pain.  For those who can read it, they should.  While Earley's accounts are graphic, I see no evidence that he dramatizes or exaggerates anything that he has seen, nevertheless the reality he reports is as cold and hard as the cells that some of those with mental illness occupy.  While reading the book will be particularly painful for anyone with a heart, and deeply distressing for anyone with brain, it will be enlightening for anyone with eyes to see what an inhumane system we have created, and allow to continue, "for" those with mental illness 
 I've been studying Tarot on and off for many years, and have a shelf full of Tarot books. This is probably my most frequently referenced book. She does a really great job of exploring the many possible meanings of the individual cards. I have only skimmed the parts on readings but there are some good insights there as well. I'm so glad they combined the two books into this one excellent resource 
 Many may find it strange to describe a rather disturbing, scary book as "beautiful", but that's how it is. There are some things about it that are tedius, like the fact that there's a part where it just drags on and on, but it doesn't last that long, and suddenly, you just want to keep reading again.   Dracula is the perfect vampire. All modern vampire stories have young, beautiful vampires. Dracula is not exactly young, but he can get younger. He has his ladies, and he hungers for the beautiful and for the intelligent. It's slightly seductive, in a way, and amazing.  Just a suggestion. Not to be read before bed. Any other time, proceed, and with deligh 
 This is a most enjoyable book.  If as a child you had Christ beaten out of you by the Christian fundamentalists as I did, this book will heal many wounds and give your spirit a chance to reconnect with the Christconsciousnes that is within us all.  If you're a Jerry Falwell-type, you won't like this book.  But if you practice loving one another as Christ taught, then this book is a must read 
 Phillip K. Dick is at his best when he is working with BIG IDEAS, and it doesn't get any bigger than this.  This book is connected in interesting ways with his insanely metaphysical Valis trilogy -- but what I think is most exciting about this one is the way he inserts himself into the universe depicted in the previous trilogy, as if to suggest that the genesis of the ideas from those books had its basis in his own experience.  This tie to the "real" world makes this the ultimate Phillip K. Dick novel (though probably not the first one to read, since the conceit works best if you are already familiar with some of his ideas and works) -- since it "intensifies" or brings to completion the level of metaphysical speculation, as if to say: "you know all those books I wrote about fantasy worlds in which it was impossible to tell the difference between fantasy and reality?... that wasn't just fiction, some of it really happened to me."  If you've only encountered Dick through the various movie adaptations (some successful some not), you should read Scanner, Ubik, and at least the Valis trilogy first, but then you won't be disappointed by this, his final work (even though it wasn't completed to his satisfaction when he died there's more good stuff in there than in several stacks of standard pulp sci fi. 
 In the fall of 1971, three years after his last studio effort, Thelonious Monk joined a tour of Europe with a band billed as the Giants of Jazz.  While in Europe, he entered a studio in London for a recording session featuring Monk as both a solo pianist and leading a trio.  These would ultimately prove to be the last recordings that Monk would make.  "The London Collection Volume 1" represents the solo piano material-- Mon seems particularly inspired, as though he almost knew this was his last chance.  An even split of originals and standards, primarily ballads, the composer is in a wistful mood.  The pieces betray a stride and early jazz influence-- the spirits of Jelly Roll Morton and James P. Johnson are stamped all over the readings of "Trinkle Tinkle", "My Melancholy Baby" and particularly, new original "Blue Sphere".  The other aspect of this music is an overt lyricism in the playing-- Monk eats the ballads alive, sticking to a more conventional sound for several of them-- this is the great solo piano reading of "Crepuscule with Nellie"-- delicate and fractured, yet beautiful and flawless, and "Darn that Dream" gets a sensitive reading that finds Monk operating in a space quite unique for him-- that of the conventional ballad pianist (although it IS unmistakably Monk).  And pieces about his son ("Little Rootie Tootie") and niece ("Jackie-ing") get lovely and powerful readings that are so firmly lodged in the Monk school that they'll catch you off guard if you're not ready for them.  This reissue contains flawless sound-- it's definitely worth the upgrade from the old (black covered) issue.  For those curious, Volume 2 (the trio session with Al McKibbon and Art Blakey) and Volume 3 (outtakes from both) are available overseas, but it'll require a bit of digging.  I managed all three here on Amazon's zShops.  This is one of the great releases by Thelonious Monk.  He's in brilliant form, and the music is fantastic.  Highly recommended 
      I browsed through it and I cannot wait to start using it 
 So far this book is a bout a kid that has a baby brother. He also thinks he is a real monster. this book is a really cool and I wouldn't want to be in his position right now 
 Reading through these reviews, I get a sense that most of the low-star ratings for this album are coming from a Post-Green Album fan base.  My personal order of buying Weezer albums was 1.) Blue Album 2.)Green Album and 3.)Pinkerton.  Certainly both "color" albums provided a lot of Pop tunes that were widely accessible to listeners.  On it's surface, Pinkerton doesn't quite provide the same ready-made Pop sensibilities as the other two albums.  However, Pinkerton does have an unmatched depth and rawness that the other two lack.  Admittedly, I had to work a little more to get into these songs, but when it hit, it hit hard and has stuck ever since.  Without hesitation, I always say that this is my favorite Weezer album.  If you decide to give this album a try do so with an open mind and the willingness to give it some time.  The payoff is well worth it.  
 I am a clinical pharmacy specialist on an internal medicine teaching service.  I have found that Lexi-Comp Drug Information is by far the most user-friendly, yet comprehensive of the portable drug references.  Drugs are listed alphabetically by generic name, so there is no fumbling through indexes and listings by class when information is needed quickly, e.g., on rounds with the medical team.  The topic headings under each monograph are extensive and thorough, and there are a number of useful appendices in the back of the book.  There is a joke in our facility that this book is surgically attached to one hand of all the clinical pharmacists.  This is the book I keep by the phone at home when I am on call, and the reference I recommend to my students to bring on teaching rounds.  While initially a "pocket" reference, the DI Handbook has quite outgrown the labcoat pocket, though it is still very portable.  Though there are some monographs for combination products, there are no side-by-side comparisons of combination drugs such as found in Facts and Comparisons, et al.  Adverse effects sections consist of lists of reactions ranked by frequnecy and categorized by organ system.  Detailed information about any specific reaction is generally lacking, but it does provide a starting point for further investigation.  Overall, this is the best combination of ease-of-use and thoroughness of information in a drug reference that I have found 
 John Huston's autobiography 'An Open Book' was written while the author - a film director whose life spanned the period from the earliest days of Hollywood to his eventual death in 1987 - was living, in old age, as something of a recluse in Mexico.   From this quiet, remote, idyllic spot he tells - as he sees it - the story of his own life and the many experiences and fotuitous friendships and relationships which he believes had been important in making him the way he was.   It goes back as far as he can go into his own ancestry and the origin of his own name - Huston. It goes deep into the impressions of his own family that he formed as a child and refined as he grew up.   He shares with us his many mistakes, as well as the background to some of his greatest  successes - which nominally, are his many great films.  But somehow more important than this is the way he approaches his life and how he tells his own story. At one point he is discussing what actually constitutes the 'style' of a writer and what makes it distinctive. He concludes that what is called a writer's style is straightforwardly a unique artefact of how that person thinks and feels about their life and experience.  This book is full of a polished but intimate candour that illuminates and compliments his long and successful career in film  
 Far beyond being a Painter for dummies... Jeremys straight forward approach offers not only how to use the tools, but when and why. Corel Painter is not exactly an easy program to learn. While I am fairly proficient with Photoshop, I've been stuck with learning Painter. I bought the DVD's first... but "Painter IX Creativity... digital artists handbook" provided the reference and more. In addition, he also provided some art background, his philosophy and mindset for an efficient workflow. This is a MUST for anyone wanting to learn Painter from a Master 
 Countering the Conspiracy...Is a book we all need to church our children with.  It's educational for the children who are having children and "we" need to get back to the concept, "It takes a village to raise a child"  This book...What can I say, we need more on the shelf like this, (It has a message).  Malynda H. K www.malyndahk.com 
 The concepts are not new and hardly new-age. There are no new ideas in this book, Mr Allan was just the first to present them is all. James Allan emphsizes the importance of hard work and effort throughout the book. He states in the book "He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little. He who would achieve much must sacrifice much. He who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly." Effort and sacrifice are common themes throughout the book. James Allan makes the point that all your hard work will be in vain if your mind is filled with thoughts of failure. 
 This movie is one of my favorites.  Although at one point it's a little corny, it's overall an awesome movie.  It's definitely a plus that Jonathan Davis of Korn does the music.  The music is definitely beyond great.  I would recommend buying this dvd 
 A good workbook to help you come to terms with yourself and Buddhism 
 This is not a good introduction to UB40 if you've never heard them before... BUT if you are into UB40 and are familiar with their songs then get this album. It is basically dub versions of their songs with DJs toasting (rapping) on every track. The best tracks are featuring Pato Banton who is well known in reggae.  So once again... dont get this as a first UB40 album but if you like reggae dub style with toasting and are familiar with UB40's songs... then this is a must have. Excellent 
 This is a tale of the sea & perhaps the best one ever told by a master who has told many. Even if sea adventure doesn't appeal to you there is much here that will impress you. Conrad sets up one of the most amazing ship at sea scenarios(which is somewhat based in fact)and then populates his boat with an assortment of interesting characters who in the beginning are very much individuals but as the storm and excitement mounts and everyones life is in peril they all merge into one entity in their shared effort to save the ship. This short book is immensely enjoyable to read because Conrads way of writing allows you to experience with the crew what is happening. You feel you are on board. It is Conrads very original literary technique which is full of sense impressions which makes it all so immediate. Don't read too much about this book before you actually read it. In fact just read it. Then read the introduction by Conrad where he lays down his artistic credo. If you read a lot of Conrad and after reading this I expect you will this credo is interesting to refer to now and then though it is most applicable to this work. I am not an expert on race in literature but I suspect Conrad was one of the first to show sensitivity to other races than his own. The reason the crew feel the way they do toward the "nigger" and his illness(feigned or no) is one of the more mysterious aspects of this book. The book exerts a strong appeal still because of its style, its way of telling a tale with sense impressions and dialogue between crew members then leaving much for you to determine. Astonishingly effective technique. It will not take long to read but it will stay with you a long time 
 This is a rather hysterical novel. Chapters of poetic descriptions of seasons and places seem to be indispersed among some sort of narrative. Characters are introduced in great detail and then vanish, sometimes to  return later on. Wolfe was a feverish writer used to bursts of inspiration  who had to [reluctantly] allow his publisher [Perkins] to edit his  voluminous manuscript down to some sort of logical sequence. This shows in  both this novel and its preceding volume [LOOK HOMEWARD]. The story is  semi-autobiographical. The writing is, in a strange sort of way, unique 
 Greg Garrett is a wonderful storyteller.  This journey is told with tremendous ease despite the sorrow that Clay Forrester is immersed in.  The only thing that would make this book any better is a soundtrack as a companion to the musical journey of this story.  I loved it 
 This is a great, moving story about Hiroko, a girl from Japan who comes to live with her uncle, and cousins in California to attend college. This story tells of the prejudices of the Japanese, and Japanese-Americans during World War II, and the family's losses during WW II but it also tells a love of Hiroko and her American boyfriend who befriends her despite her being Japanese, and falls in love with her. I loved this book, and I cried during certain parts of this book, it was that moving. I loved it, and I know you will too. It is very fast-moving and an easy read. I couldn't put it down. I read this book in 2 days 
 This is one of the most compelling works of Christian "fiction" ever written.  While the Chinese names at the beginning may slow your progress initially, one-third of the way through you will not want to put the book down.  In the last chapters, you will be so excited to see what is going to happen you may find yourself skimming the pages.  It is definitely a book to re-read shortly after finishing the first time and even again afterwards.  The hardest part is deciding whether to read it again or pass it on to a fellow believer so that they can experience the rush of this novel.    Randy Alcorn has truly captured the heart of the Underground Church in China and will make you self-conscious of your lack of zeal...now that is a Biblical term to throw in here isn't it?  I finished this book the first time on a plane travelling to a business appointment with tears streaming down my face...and never felt better after reading any book.    My highest recommendation and you really need to add this book to your family's library.  
 Anyone interested in Shakespeare and Orson Welles will want to buy this extremely useful and unusually thoughtful book.  It is quite compact and  offers chapters on all of the Shakespeare films Welles made.  Anderegg  argues tht Welles sought to democratize Shakespeare through the use of mass  media such as records, radio, and film.  there's a wonderful opening  chapter about an I Love Lucy episode with Welles and a stunning conclusion  about Welles as a star author (Anderegg contrast him with Bertolt Brecht).   The book is very well-written and very accesible.  Ideal for classroom use 
 This book is so much fun. I love having something small to read daily. Some of the trivia is even new to me!! A great addition to any Disney collectors library 
 This book brings together the stories of seemingly unrelated people who all perish on a bridge collapse. The book is philosophical, but not in a heavy handed way. The writing is eloquent and the story is memorable. I read this for a book club and we all had much to say about whether or not we liked it and what the deeper meaning is behind the story. This is a thought provoking book from a skilled writer. 
 i'm not a biblical scholar, nor well read with religious ideologies, but this is an interesting book.  it seems well researched and easy to read.  looking back through history and how christianity came to power, i believe it is still reflected in what we are seeing in the political world today.  our government is corrupt, doing what it pleases for power and control.  instilling fear, paranoia and profits before people, etc.  and it's not just one party that is guilty, but both.  anyway, looking at this book, it amazes me how much history does repeat itself.  what i've learned from this book is that church and state has never been separate, but intertwined with each others interests.  i highly recommend reading this book 
 The LSAT Workout is like a chaser to the nastiest tequila that you've ever tasted: it is necessary.  This book takes everything you think you learned in Cracking the LSAT and really extends on it.  Remember: Cracking the LSAT is like liquor and LSAT workout is like beer.  Liquor before beer and you're in the clear.  Beer before liquor and you'll get sicker.  Don't do the LSAT Workout until you have fully completed Cracking the LSAT.  Once you get done with these two books, you are ready to start hammering away at the LSAC books and LSAT practice tests 
 In a very clear and throughly accurate manner Richard Friedman comments enlighten those who wish to understand the holy book 
 My son has loved these since he was about 8 mo, and now he is a pre-schooler.  Well, as with all pop-ups, I always supervise, but this series has fairly simple engineering, so an over enthusisastic tug or rip is fairly easy to cellotape.  Our four books have lots of tape, but they still work after three years of frequent use.  The pop-ups and presentation are so appealing, you will never regret this purchase.  An absolute classic for your childs library 
 Personally, being a member of a weekly TT group, I've seen all too many times when our resident ST pulls this book out of his pack before a satisfying game to ignore its value.. 
 Whether married for 5,10,25,or 50, This book offers much to understanding the trauma all married people feel at some period in their marriage 
 I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULD READ A BOOK THAT WOULD SURPASS THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD BUT THIS IS COMING MIGHTY CLOSE!!  SOME MAY BE PUT OFF BY HURSTON'S METHOD OF SHOWING DIALOGUE BETWEEN HER CHARACTERS BUT IT FORCES  YOU TO SLOW DOWN AND SAVOR THE ESSENCE OF THE STORY.  BELIEVE ME, IT IS  WORTH THE EFFORT.  HER CHOICES OF WORDS AND HER CATCHY PHRASES MAKE HER  WORTHY OF ALL THE PRAISE THAT SHE HAS RECEIVED 
 Perhaps a mis-titled book, Mayflower is partly the story of a religious community seeking utopia in the New World, but mostly how their descendants engaged in a perhaps inevitable and bloody clash of cultures, highlighted by King Phillip's War.  It is the latter story that has the most impact, and perhaps Philbrick intentionally used the Mayflower title and the Pilgrim's story to draw in the reader to his intended focus on the generation that followed.  In the end, while I felt a bit fooled, I was grateful and enlightened.  There are numerous English heroes of deserved fame, like Miles Standish and William Bradford of the Mayflower Pilgrims, or Benjamin Church who led the English in the later wars with the Natives.  But there are also many ambiguous figures driven by base motives of revenge, fame, wealth, and power as well.  Further, Philbrick does an admirable job of presenting both the heroes and devils of the Native Americans who engaged the English.  The Native figures like Massasoit and his son "King" Phillip struggled just as the English did with whether to assimilate with, separate from, or to annihilate the other.   Philbrick's descriptions of engagements between the English and the Natives range from raging battle scenes to intimate conversations within an Indian wigwam.  Each of the stories are told with sufficiently vivid detail without losing the larger context.  Philbrick balances his narrative in this manner to keep the reader stimulated with imagery and storyline without putting at risk the larger picture of engagement between cultures.  Mayflower does not so much seek to explode myths about the early Pilgrims, but to put their stories in the context of what came next.  Mayflower offers 21st Century educated readers a fresh glimpse of a period in early American history that is often overshadowed by myths and later colonial-era events.  Highly recommended 
 While not particularly deep, this book covers a lot  of territory and fills in a lot of background to what has been my sketchy knowledge of circus life.  I'm not really interested in circuses, but this was an interesting book and gave yet another dimension to my understanding of the Great Depression.  Some of the minor characters take on real depth, including Walter, some of the general circus laborers, and, of course, Rosie.  And it really purges the emotions and releases a lot of pent up anger in a hilarious and horrible act of vengence.    This is a good and well-told story. 
 Consider that there are three categories of poker books; technical books such as those that Sklansky, Harrington, and Malmuth write, "tells" books such as Caros Book of Tells, and "head game" books.This is the best I've read in the "head games" category.   The author does a very good job of categorizing different styles of play into four "corners" similar to a Gartner box; Tight Passive, Tight Agressive, Loose Passive, Loose Agressive. He then discusses and describes these and includes a short "preview" section you can use as a review before you go play.  The author does a very good job of framing this psychological information strictly in the context of a poker game. It is a very readable and very interesting book. Unless you really believe you know everything there is to know (and there are a lot of those types of people out there) you will learn something new from this book.  I am developing a few books that I will reread and use as references; Sklansky and Malmuths new No Limit Holdem, Caros Book of Tells, and The Psychology of Poker 
 The movie was a beautiful story of love and loss starring Sarah Miles and Robert Mitchum.  It was set on the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland -- the scenery was breathtaking and was an integral part of the storytelling.  The back story of the Irish revolution and the role of the townspeople in that effort added a complicated and interesting twist to the story.  I loved the movie and the characters and no one captures heartbreak in a beautiful setting better than David Lean (director) also of Dr. Zhivago fame 
 I greatly enjoyed reading this magazine in years past. However, I have not received anything yet from my Amazon.com order. I am eagerly waiting for my subscription to start!! 
 Consisting entirely of descriptions of fantastical cities supposedly reported by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan, Calvino's fiction is sui generis, a completely original mixture of fable and philosophy that is even more imaginative than his more critical theory-oriented "If On A Winter's Night A Traveler." This is the kind of novel Borges might have written. A celebration of the unbridled imagination, "Invisible Cities" is also, I am convinced, a secret love letter to a single city: the imaginary dream-city of Venice, a place that exists partly as its own reflection in the sea 
 BLIND FAITH (Fe ciega) Desde el nombre indica que no durarian mucho, debido a mucho talento entre sus integrantes. CREMA+TRAFFIC básicamente.El filme del concierto tal y como aparece en el DVD es aceptable, cortan algunas canciones como Well Alright y Do what you like la cual es una lástima que no se haya incluido completa, es muy visible las mutilaciones de la cinta en dichas canciones, pero bueno creo que por el momento para ser el primer film en concierto es aceptable. Esperamos todos los amantes del rock clásico en todo el mundo que no sea el único, y se editen con el tiempo más conciertos de Blin Faith. Los músicos se notan no muy motivados, Eric Clapton se ve muy apagado, Rich Gretch muy discreto y solo Ginger Baker y Winwood le pusieron algo de ánimo al asunto; la música es excelente sin duda, pero les falto inyectar más energía al público, además que es una pena que solo hayan tocado tan pocas canciones. Es importante recordar que todavia no tenian grabado el disco completo, por lo que hicieron cambios a algunas canciones para la grabación final. Como documento historico es excelente. BLIND FAITH, queremos que se editen más videos de sus conciertos, no es justo todavia que a 37 años de su formación, solo exista un concierto para disfrutar de su música 
 Although you do need to practice outside of this book as well, Let's Learn Hiragana has a nice set-up so it's easy to understand and work through. There's an introduction about the usage of hiragana and an overview of what's in the book, then there's sections for groups of ten morae. I've only had time to finish two sections, but with outside practice and the worksheet, I've already memorized the twenty. A great way to start learning the kana system 
 The Mislabeled Child is a revolutionary book that looks beneath the labels children receive, and addresses the real underlying issues. Essential reading for parents, teachers, and health care professionals alike, this highly readable text provides specific, practical approaches to recognizing and capitalizing on children's strengths in order to help them flourish. From sensory processing difficulties to dyslexia, from language problems to poor handwriting skills, the Eides provide useful insights and marvelous advice.  
 In C is a launch pad for a group of students form New Yock and is composed by the great Terry Riley.For some reason this album is good to listen to on a rainy day,the clutter of insterments playing and interweaving the musical bits and pieces together is soothing to. Also good to fall asleep on. For the length of the album it never gets tirering and the funny thing is the c note on the piano begins,plays all the way though and ends the piece but the string is broken.I recommend this to anyone wanting something new to listen to. 
 My five year old loves Snow Inside The House - for that matter, so do I.  Wouldn't you want to skate with a penguin in the tub or sled down the stairs?  Diviny and Rocco are a great team - Keep your finger's crossed  that we'll see more from this imaginative pair 
 What it really likes me more of this movie is the fact the horror comes from the undecipherable Mother nature at the moment you decide break the nature rules, in the name of science or whatever the reason be. A group of scientists run afoul a prehistoric man-fish inhabiting in depth waters in the remote backwaters of the Amazon.   The picture explores the recondite mysteries of the Nature that still live inside. The horror in this sense is a debt you have to pay when you open Pandora 's box. It is a supernatural force, unpredictable where the creature will establish the expected ancestral link that connects with King Kong for instance.   Once these members discover it, the fight for surviving will take its place and the hunters will be hunted. It is worthy to remark the fact there were three films that rode the same path The fly, Them and this one in what it respects to describe the horror from the inner Earth and not from the outer space: Can these manifestations be considered as aliens for our established social status? Or worse still are not we the aliens for them in the sense of invade its territories?   If not ask for Spielberg, who applied the same formula in Jurassic Park with spectacular stages but with the same paradigm; the employed device does not matter: it is the rupture of the laws of the nature; it 's Alberich stealing the Gold in Walhalla what, in last instance, determines the logic and expected reaction: it 's Wotan 's punishment when he transgressed the norm. All tragedy implies the violation of a limit; natural or human. In the first case we have a tragedy, in the second we have subversion.  In Halloween 's month it is more than an obligated reference to acquire this icon of the Horror genre.                         
 The 1969 hits are the best songs since the very first year, 1960, installed in this series. A favorite song of mine, and many other rock n roll fans is "Aquarius". This is included with another nice song, "Let the Sunshine In". These and "Na Na Hey Hey", are some of the most popular songs ever and some of the most richly deserved entries on this CD. Very accomadating music for parties or somebody hanging out at home. The lyrics here are suitable for oldies fans, and technical quality, the usual of Billboard is also very good. Since I am 13 years old and enjoy this music, quality is essential. Music is very easy to hear and free of static. Seems as if it was recorded just after broadcasting in 1969. The music groups presented here are varied, and each song is quite different from the last. So, at this point, I seriously recommended the entire 60's Billboard series 
 This is so much better than those crappy plastic boosters I can't believe we didn't buy it sooner.  It's easy to clean and doesn't slide off the chair.  Our son fits in it perfectly and now feels like a big boy.  It even has a little carrying bag to take on trips.  Great vendor with quick delivery too 
 Looks great, haven't had time to read, but is similar to one he wrote (currently out of print) loaned to me by my art teacher 
 The other reviews published here are well earned.  My one reservation:  whoever arranged the harmonic turnarounds at the end of sections of most of these tunes or at the finish of a tune, used the simple VIm7-IIm7-V7-IMaj7 progression.  It seems like the arranger merely "plugged in" these turnaround harmonies.  Although these harmonies "work," I would have liked more variety in the harmonies at the turnaround points 
 I Loved this book. I am a travel writer (Italy Guide, Tusnacy & Umbria Guide, Rome Guide) and thought I knew Italy like the back of my hand, but this volume opened up vistas I could not have imagined. I found myself following in the footstep of literary greats, dogging their posthumous steps through the pages of Italy in Mind, and ended up seeing so much more of the country than I had before. Highly recommended reading before travel and while there. A gem of a book 
 Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci brings that certain European pacing and feel to his movies, even though the past several have been made in English and often with at least one American actor. This means you can expect a great amount of talking and very little action, which can be wonderful if you are in the right frame of mind. He also brings that European attitude toward sexuality and nudity (and no, I am not equating the two), which is to say his actors are fairly uninhibited. He usually peppers his films with a fair amount of nudity and/or sex, and "Stealing Beauty" is no exception. It is no secret the average American is much more inhibited about his or her body than the average European, which provides the filmmaker with an opportunity for commentary. American teen, Lucy, visits her family in Tuscany shortly after her mother's passing in order to find her father. She is taken aback, however, when she heads to the swimming pool one day and finds everyone lounging about naked. She declines to join in. Eventually, however, she loosens up enough to expose a breast while posing for a portrait. "When in Rome..." (or in the vicinity, anyway). Bertolucci is providing a view of the Italian way of life, or at least those aspects that interest him most, through the eyes of an American. He compares and contrasts the two cultures with details that seem too obvious to even illuminate. It is interesting that Lucy seems to find more in common with some of the Italians she meets than she does with some of the Americans there. Over the course of the film, beauty takes precedence over deeper levels of meaning, though this is not necessarily to the film's detriment. This is essentially a coming-of-age story, with Lucy learning to enjoy life's simple pleasures, including sex. It is evident that Bertolucci finds beauty and pleasure to be of the utmost importance, which makes this subject a perfect fit for him. Liv Tyler is up to the task of carrying this film and the rest of the cast is marvelous as well. This is one to enjoy for its characters, its mood and yes, its beauty. 
 Ok to start off I've heard different opinions about camera sensor blowers..some say it works like magic some say it can make it worse. So I gambled and bought this Giotto blower. I didn't want to buy all the cleaning swabs, liquid ect and rub it off...seemed like a annoying project. So I gave this blower a try. I never had that much dust on my sensor but when made my aperture smaller f/22 to be exact and did a picture of the blue sky I noticed a few blobs or dust spots. I wanted them off...now heres where the blower comes in. I used it a total of 3 times and it removed 98% of the dust off my sensor..thats really really good in my book for a $9 device. Now I have like 2 tiny dust spots on my sensor and I can easily live with that..or I could try to use it a few more times to completely get it off... In the meantime I'm very happy with the dust I got off it. Buy this blower....its a no brainer. 
 Before the Deluge is a wonderful, compelling social history of Berlin between the wars.  It explores the fascinating social, cultural, and scientific developments in Berlin as the political drama of Nazism plays out in the background.  In these pages you will meet some of the 20th century's greatest politicians, artists, filmmakers, scientists, etc. who meet in the crossroads of Central Europe.  Where else can you get Karajan, Einstein, Isherwood, Hitler, Weil, Garbo, and Lang in the same book........And, if you like this book, also try Olympia: Paris in the Age of Manet or City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940's - both by Friedrich: both of them are equally good 
 Lurking behind the story until now have been the nobles a mysterious ruling class with their own agendas.  We know that there is strife between then, that Cheza was stolen from the Darcias, and that Lady Jaguera hates wolves.  But we don't really know much else.  This DVD is there turn, even though it leaves more mysteries than it solves.  Even as the House of Lords arrest Hubb Lebowski, conflict breaks out and Lord Orkham, Cheza's original kidnapper is slain.  Chaos happens, Hubb escapes and forms an uneasy truce with Quent.  Darcia confronts the wolves and manages to hold off Kiba long enough to reclaim Cheza, triggering a wild hunt.  Blue, whom you will recall was Quent's 'dog.' Reappears as a beautiful wolf and joins the others in their effort to save Cheza.  Complicated enough?  We're not done yet, Cher rejoins Hubb and Quent, and absolutely everyone heads for Darcia's keep for what can only be describes as a near apocalyptic conflict.  If I didn't know this was the middle of the series, I would have assumes that the tragic drama unfolding in this DVD's final episode was really the end, now I have to wonder how they are ever going to top it.  This series has set such a high standard for story, art, and music from the beginning that I feel foolish telling you that with every DVD it seems to get better.  But one could watch this DVD in the original Japanese with no real clue what is happening and still sense that something momentous is in play.  And still get lost in the gothic atmospherics of a world that seems to be dying because it's spirit - the spirit of the wolves - has deserted it.  Each character has some loss to deal with, from Darcia's towering grief to Toboe's homelessness, and out of this a story is being woven of a magical kingdom and the quest for Paradise.  Is it really what the characters want?  Is there a path to healing amid the moonflowers?  We don't know yet.  But, like Kiba, we still can hope so 
 4.5/5  Nevermind burst open grunge music into mainstream America. Ten solidified it. And while many flannel-clad kids were waiting for Jeremy II: Tales fom the Underworld, Pearl Jam presented us with what I believe to be their best album so far. Much more diverse and bold, Vs. enjoys a powerhouse in the Abbruzzese/Ament drums/bass combo. Vedder's lyrics go up a notch while his vocal performance sounds primal and angrier.  Gossard and McCready, in turn, begin to learn to play off each other. In all, an incredible album that helped define an era.  Go. - Dave Abbruzzese kicks off this album with bold, hard drumming. After a short pause, at 00:29, all hell breaks loose.  Jeff Ament drives through with an impressive bass riff that nicely complements Dave's drumming. The rest of the song has Eddie Vedder wailing away "Don't go on me" on top of muscle riffs by Stone Gossard, interjected by speedy, Mike McCready solos. In all, an outstanding way to open up an album. 4/5  Animal. - The album speeds up with Animal. Harder and grittier than Go, Animal has Vedder in primal rage. Special note must be given again to the awesome Abruzzese/Ament combo. 4.5/5  Daughter. - The first Pearl Jam ballad, Daughter deals with a young girl with ADHD. Superb. 5/5  Glorified G. - The story goes that Abbruzzese, who is incidentally from Texas, shows up one day with two guns: purpotedly for self defense. The guys didn't take it too kindly as evidenced by this song. The track is about the gun culture in the US and how some people glorify their guns as if they were gods (note the play on G.) This song is extremely funny (especially when they sing together "glorified version" and when Vedder says "KINDred to be an American). Moreover, Abbruzzese does some strangely uplifting drumming (strangely since the song is, if the rumor is true, making fun of him). Nonetheless, the lyrics fall short of Vedder's capabilities. 4/5  Dissident. - Along with Animal and Daughter, Dissident is one of the more popular tracks in the album. Not as hard as the first two songs, but not as soft as the third, Dissident is in many ways the "Alive" of Vs. Both share similar anthemic structures. Vedder sings about someone who shelters a dissident for a while, but then hands him towards the authorities. However, she regrets having done so for the rest of her life. 4.5  WMA. - The Ament/Abbruzzese combo shines here once again. The entire track works on Ament's bass riff, complemented by some innovative and complex drumming. Vedder and Gossard stay in the background while McCready shows up sporadically. After a while, though, you start getting bored with the repetitious riffs and Vedder screming "Policemen." At that time, 3:25 to be exact, the track explodes much a la Animal. The rumor here is that Vedder was once talking to a black friend when a white cop showed up. Ignoring Vedder, the cop started to harass Vedder's friend. Apocryphal or not, this is a solid song on racism. 4/5  Blood .- By far the hardest song on Vs. Blood talks about how he feels shortchanged and manipulated by the media. Specifically, by Rolling Stone ("Roll me over"), Spin Magazine ("Spin me over") and Circus Magazine ("F---ing Circus"). Also, there is some interesting play on words with "Painted Big, Turned into of his enemies," which can also be read "Paint Ed big, Turn Ed into." Vedder does something similar in Daughter with Violins/Violence. Overall good track, but I find such extreme screams unbecoming of Pearl Jam. 3.5/5  Rearviewmirrow .- Along with Evenflow, I think Rearviewmirror is the best, hard song Pearl Jam has ever composed. But whereas Evenflow starts off hard, Rearviewmirror takes its time. The track is about leaving an abusive situation, and how things become clearer as you achieve some perspective. Apparently, the song was written about Vedder's relationship with his stepfather. Anyway, this is, needless to say, the best track on Vs. 5/5  Rats .- Even though Vs peaks with Rearviewmirror, Rats is far from an underachievement. The Ament/Abbruzzese combo and Vedder's primal growl are both back, to great effect at that. The track compares rats to humans in a, well, not so favorable way. Also, we have some funny references to Ben of Willard and Michael Jackson fame. 4.5/5  Elderly Woman .- Another solid ballad. This song has different levels of meaning, from the superficial about an elderly woman in a small town to a reflection on our mortality. Also, it is extremely catchy. 4/5  Leash .- Like Breath and Love Boat Captain, Leash is one of those few instances where Pearl Jam shine in their optimism. Here Vedder advises us to take control of our youth and get rid of the authoritative leashes put on us. What else can I say, but...drop the leash, drop the leash...GET OUT OF MY F---ING FACE!!! 4/5  Indifference .- Indifference is the first step into what will culimante with Nothing As It Seems. Brilliant as it is haunting, Indifference talks about despondency and deppression. The track falls in line with Pearl Jam's tendency to end their albums in a contemplative note (forget the stupid mop that was to come next!) 5/5  One last note: Dave once said that even though Dave Kruzen's work in Ten was technically good, it was far from bold and aggressive. After hearing Abbruzzese's work in Vs. you'll know what he was talking about. The Ament/Abbruzzese combo is truly something to behold 
 In 2005 Murder Inc Records (also known as The Inc) decided to leave Def Jam and pursue a new record distribution home.  But in order to do that, they needed Ja Rule and Ashanti each to release one more album a piece to fulfill the contract requirements, so they both put out greatest hits albums.  Ja Rules album was called, "Exodus" which supposedly is the final goodbye as his Ja Rule gimmick and soon is coming out with his new albums under the name "Loki."  Anyway this album is all of Ja's hits since his first album til currently plus three new recordings.  1. Exodus (Intro) - 4.5/5  2. Me - 3.5/5  3. Holla, Holla - 3.5/5  4. It's Murda (Featuring DMX & Jay-Z) - 4.5/5  5. Put It On Me (Featuring Vita) - 3.5/5  6. I Cry (Featuring Lil' Mo) - 3.5/5  7. Living It Up (Featuring Case) - 4/5  8. Always on Time (Featuring Ashanti) - 3/5  9. Ain't It Funny [Murder Remix] (Featuring Jennifer Lopez & Caddillac Tah) - 3/5  10. Thug Lovin'(Featuring Bobby Brown) - 4.5/5  11. Mesmerize (Featuring Ashanti) - 4/5  12. Clap Back - Minute+ Talking Intro - 4/5  13. New York (Featuring Fat Joe & Jadakiss) - 5/5  14. Wonderful (Featuring R. Kelly & Ashanti) - 4/5  15. Never Again - 4/5  16. Daddy's Little Baby (Featuring Ronald Isley) - 4.5/5  17. Love Me Hate Me - 3.5/5  18. Exodus (Outro) - 4/5  Overall:  70.5/90  3.5 Stars  Most of these tracks showed Ja's softer, radio-friendly side, the side that doesn't really appeal to me.  But he also had some hardcore joints on here like "New York" which is probably his best and my favorite one of his tracks.  If you own all of his previous albums like I do, just download the three new tracks.  Now that his career on Def Jam is over, we'll see how his career shapes up when he releases his two new albums in 2007 
 I have never been able to figure out why "Fire On High" never made it on any ELO compilation (to my knowledge). It rocks and is on the playlists of most FM stations plus it just may be their best song. Of course those stations continue to play "Evil Woman" and "Strange Magic" and they should. The biggest drawbacks of this great album is the 36 minute length and lack of remastering. Bonus tracks would be nice to add to this classic rock gem 
 best series out there on any sci-fi show, makes you think and imagine the worlds out there in the universe.  this is a good after thought of star trek 
 Works well, and its disposable batteries are a big plus.  Tank is of adequate size.  Nicely built and has held up well in extensive travel.  Recommended 
 Eloise Wilkin has been a favorite since I was a child, we treasured our Little Golden Books and passed some down to our own children, my daughters especially loved the illustrations of the little children . Now I am buying them for my grandchildren, this book is beautifully bound and includes some of her best work. Mrs. Wilkin creates a lovely, serene and happy family atmosphere that children and adults relate to and enjoy. Our grandchildren are the third generation to thrill to these books 
 I got this for my birthday.  I am an art teacher and this was purchased for the art history portion of the book (I am a movie and history buff as well...so bonus)  What a treat looking through this book and trying to guess what each stick person picure might be.  I am planning on showing these to my graphic design students, what a great lesson in the making!  It was the hit of the party 
 It is the best memory i have ever had to protect your files. It's simple to use, and accurate. I recommend it, if you need to encript your data 
 Very commercial approach to exercising by virtue of glamorizing machines and muscle isolation. The chapter on corrective exercises is infuriating. The author suggests corrective measures for kyphosis, lordosis, front head, and pronation of feet, winging and elevation of scapulas. That is totally unfounded and should be stricken out of the book. Though exercise alleviates living with deformities, it does not correct them since deformities entail genetic elements, bone and cartilage elements, ligaments and muscle elements, and finally, habitual factors, their correction is formidable.  Corrective measures (better be called rehabilitating measures) should be a long term aim rather than a snap shot remedial solution.  The author's common sense strategy is demonstrated in the discussion of periodization, progressive incremental strengthening, and balancing aerobics with anaerobic modes of training. The author is very motivational in instructing beginners on how to get started, stick to a plan, and avoid unrealistic expectations (other than correcting deformities).  The strongest aspect of the author's expertise lies in his stretching, flexibility, and isolation exercises, his weakest being compound exercises with floor to overhead range. In an ugly photo of overhead shoulder press, the lifter is caving his chest, standing unevenly, holding the bar far in front of the vertical plan through the heels, and without adequate lumbar arching. That is similar to the cover photo where the elbows are bent and the shoulders are lowered when the barbell is overhead. The right posture should portray well-thrust chest, elevated shoulders, straight arms, and bar positioned in a plane behind the head and vertically over the low back and heels.    The tests on flexibility, strength, and endurance are reasonable except that on the overhead squat where the author is unfamiliar of the mechanics of performing such highly technical move. It could cause injuries if people hold a bar overhead and start squatting without realizing the need for warming up the shoulder and lumbar regions adequately before tackling such move.  Some of the inconvenient injuries of overhead squat by unwary persons are rotator cuff tears, and low back, neck, and elbow injuries.  The repetitive description of exercises in multiple sections of the book makes it dizzying. The same exercises are viewed over and over, yet there is no consistent plan to link them together. The book leaves me with a nagging question: Why everyone in the book is an old man (over 21)? Why young people are neglected so long? For those, running, push ups, chin ups, and jumping suffice for a blueprint of a great body.   "Burn Baby Burn" could be done easier than the book suggests. Just eliminate bread and simple carbohydrates from food (processed carbohydrates). That would deplete the fat pool effectively and do away with intestinal distension that hinders the individual's cardiopulmonary function. Losing weight is easier than the fad portrays it to be.

  Woody Allen makes good, very good, and excellent films.  Husbands and Wives is a very good film with excellent performances. It is not a comedy but rather a dramedy that explores marriages and relationships of four main characters. It has several funny moments and dialogs (it is Allen after all) but it has disturbing and sad scenes, too.  When Jack and Sally (Sidney Pollack and Judy Davis) announce that they're separating, this comes as a shock to their best friends Gabe and Judy (Allen and Farrow). They start to reevaluate their own marriage only to find out that it is not as perfect as they thought. Very soon Jack and Sally, and then Gabe and Judy start to meet new people - young, bright, and attractive. They all hope that new is better, and for some of them it is true while the others come to understanding that true love involves loving another's imperfections even when very well aware of them.   This film is for all husbands and wives, lovers, and partners around the world. It is for couples who've been in a relationship for a month, a year, or decades. It is for singles who are ready or who think they want to enter a relationship. It is also for people who don't. All of us have been or may find ourselves in a situation or relationship or having a conversation like the ones in the Allen's film. All of us think and talk about love, trust, understanding, fidelity, sex, and yes - marriage.   The best scenes of the film belong to Allen and Farrow. Some of their conversations in the movie probably reflect the situation in their own relationship that ended soon after the film was made. It is the last film Allen made with Farrow.   Judy Davis played the role of her carrier practically stealing the film. I was shocked to find out that she received all possible Critics Awards that year and lost Best Supporting Oscar to Marisa Tomei. I love Tomei's performance in My Cousin Vinny (1992) but nomination itself would've been enough. Davis was the Best Supporting actress (I saw all films with nominated performances). Sidney Pollack (The Oscar winning director of Out of Africa and two times nominee for Tootsie and They Shoot Horses, Don't They?) and Liam Nisson were wonderful. I did not like Juliet Lewis at all. What she did adorably in Cape Fear with De Niro for ten minutes scene, she tried to stretch for over an hour here - did not work, IMO.  I like "Husbands and Wives" - it was interesting to watch, and it left me thinking if such thing as perfect relationship is ever possible, and what it would take to not only find it but to keep it.   4.5/5  
 The second acoustic album by Bruce Springsteen is a very underrated album. It is also very like Nebraska in a storytelling sense. The only problem is this album has synths added and it seems not as demo like as Nebraska was. The title track is also the best song on the album and one of Springsteen's best written songs. Rage Against the Machine would later do it over, but it will never be as good as this. Favorites include The Ghost of Tom Joad, Highway 29, Youngstown, Sinaloa Cowboys, Balboa Park, New Timer, Across the Border, and My Best Was Never Good Enough. Highly Highly Recommended 
 Every so often a sitcom comes along that stays with you for a very long time after you've watched it, and "Nighty Night", the BBC's most recent sitcom-to-DVD conversion, is just such a thing.  Jill Tyrell (Julia Davis, the show's writer and creator, and a fabulous comedy actress, to boot), a beautician in a nondescript Northern town, is devastated to learn that her husband Terry (Kevin Eldon) has cancer. This happens to be the first scene of the first episode, and it's the last rational reaction you'll see for the next three hours. Jill, not one to rest on her laurels, decides a new man is the order of the day, and, before Terry is even ill, much less dead, deposits him in the hospital and heads off to find a man. Enter the unlucky Don (Angus Deayton), and his multiple sclerosis-afflicted wife Cathy (Rebecca Front), as Jill's new neighbours. Deciding that he's the man for her, and blindly ignoring the fact that Terry doesn't seem to be getting any sicker, Jill goes about driving a wedge between Don and Cathy, and keeping Terry's presence a secret from all and sundry.  As with "The League of Gentlemen", "Nighty Night" is a comedy that gets laughs from its situational absurdity. The main characters, with the exception of Jill, are portrayed beautifully as normal, rational people cast headlong into an unreasonable situation, but, thanks to the machinations of the ensemble of secondary characters (such as the gloriously funny Ruth Jones as Jill's long-suffering employee and friend Linda, and the wickedly irreverent Mark Gatiss as her erstwhile paramour Glenn Bulb), they soon find themselves descending to a level of abnormality that they're clearly not comfortable with. Happily, this makes for the best viewing, and "Nighty Night" is one of the best comedies to come out of Britain in recent years.   Julia Davis as Jill is monstrously cruel, totally self-centred and completely sociopathic, but, as with all good anti-heroes, she manages to generate such sympathy for the character that we are rooting for her to win, in the end. It's a brilliant portrayal of a character, that, in the hands of a lesser actress or with less care taken over the finer points of the script, could easily have sunk into one-dimensional nastiness. Happily, Davis has created in Jill Tyrell a sitcom heroine to rival - and beat - the likes of Basil Fawlty, Patsy Stone and Vicki Pollard at their own game.  I'm not going to give anything away, so I'm going to end my review here, suffice it so say that here are three of the best and funniest hours you could ever own on DVD. Extras - outtakes and almost twenty minutes of deleted scenes - are wonderful, and the audio/video quality is, as one would expect from the BBC, top-drawer.  Wholeheartedly recommended as an essential purchase 
 I found this book easy to read and navigate.  It was full of helpful and informative information.  It gives real life useful tips and should be read by anyone thinking about or already pursuing a career in education 
 Latter films with Peter Sellers were minimal on story, but After the Fox is an incredibly funny film with wit and humor, gags and a really great cast.  Sellers plays Aldo Venucci who takes on the task of smuggling the Gold of Cairo into Italy.  This movie is terrific, written by Neil Simon and directed by Vittorrio DeSica, it's a parody of stereotypic italian pics with lots of scenes, scenarios and sight gags to keep you laughing. Music and title song written by Burt Bacharach.  Victor Mature steals scene after scene as the over the hill Tony Powell who's refusing to give in to the reality of his age.  Martin Balsam as his agent has quite a few funny scenes for being Mature's straight man and that's not taking anything away from Sellers or Tamaroff. One of the funniest scenes Sellers and Maria Gazia Buccella (whoa what a babe) meeting in an Italian restaurant and I won't say anything more. As film critic Mario Stavoli said "Bravo, bravo, it's brilliant, what depth, what meaning, I cried, I cried like a baby.... 
 I'm old enough to remember the cold war and all the good spy movies that went with it. While it was certainly great that this period in history came to an end, it seemed all the well-made suspenseful spy books and movies went with it.   So I was very excited when I went to see The Bourne Indentity at the theater and I was not disappointed. The action is crisp and the fight scenes very realistic--no superhero stuff. Also, the protaganist, Matt Damon, is not presented as a hero, but a complicated individual, and I found myself wondering what had led him to his life as a spy/killer in the first place.  Matt Damon is very convincing in this and his costar, Franka Potente, is a breath of fresh air. A real European with a European look and a good actress 
    To be honest, I rented this out of sheer desperation a couple of years ago, having seen virtually every other horror movie for rent in town (this was before everybody started stocking a dozen new horror titles a month, a welcome development).  I'd seen 2 or 3 of the earlier installments and not been impressed and given up on the series.  I'm not trying to bash them, I know alot of people really love the whole series, but the original and the first sequel just didn't do anything for me personally.  I'm not sure whether I even saw "Urban Harvest" or not -  I guess I couldn't have cared for it too much if I did.  But I took a chance on this one, breaking my own rule of Never skipping ahead in a series (3, 4 and 5 weren't available) and was certainly glad I did.     Very few times have I gone into a movie with such low expectations and been so totally blown away in surprise.  "Children Of The Corn 666: Isaac's Return" is an absolute treasure find!  It involves a young woman in search of her past and ending up in the farm town central to the series, notorious for events that happened there previously.  The town's cult of children are apparantly in remission, maintaining a facade of normalcy in a community where adults now live as well, the children of the cult biding their time and waiting for some kind of promised dark messiah.  I don't really know how closely this fits into the overall series continuity; after seeing this I decided to see all the other chapters but have only seen the follow-up, "Revelation", a good movie but not on par with this one and quite unconnected to it.  The previous chapters can't be found for rent and I've already decided I'm going to have to eventually buy them sight unseen (the only reason I haven't done so yet is there are about 500 other movies on my personal 'waiting-to-be-bought' list) but haven't seen them yet, so I don't know if everything fits together or not.    A soaring high point of the movie is a romantic angle which I won't go into too much here, occuring as it does later in the movie.  It includes one tremendously sexy scene that achieves its appeal not by being especially overt (not that I'm opposed to other, more openly sexy scenes in different movies), but through the high romanticism and beautiful tenderness.  And yes, the female character's limited clothing in the scene certainly doesn't hurt things either, although it would have been gorgeous even without that added benefit.     Intelligent, suspenseful, and well-acted, this is highly recommended for either longtime fans of the series or those who (like me) never were into it before.  I might even give the original another try someday and see if there's something there I missed.  My only grievance is the ending - this isn't giving anything away, but it could have gone in either of two directions and I would have preferred the road they didn't take.  That's purely subjective and doesn't mean the final minutes weren't just as well realized as the rest of the movie.  I hope there's a direct followup to this entry with the same characters - the next sequel was a totally different path and different people.  Still good, but this one is awesome 
 "Let there Be Light" This is a story about two scientists who discover a method to use sunlight for energy. (Sound familiar). The scientists run into a snag, however, because the power company doesn't want the world to have cheap, non-polluting power. In this story, Heinlein is, as always, ahead of his time. The story itself has a few loose ends such as, who is really the father of the scientist. The story hints that he may be a politician but never lets us know. Also, and this is a spoiler question, do the two scientists form a romatic relationship? A good, quick read.  "The Roads Must Roll" In this story all transportation is done by moving roads, which sound rather similar to a juiced up, horizontal escalator. The story looks at what happens if a small group of disgruntled employees decide they want to be in charge and take over one of the moving roads. A good look at specialization and unionization.  "Blowups Happen" This is a story about the occupational stress workers experience at a nuclear power plant. This is a great look at occupational hazards and the extremes society will go to ensure they have power when they want it.  "The Man Who Sold the Moon" and "Requiem" These stories are about D. D. Harriman, a man who dreamed of going to the moon as a boy, and makes sure it happens as an adult. Both are great stories that look at how determination can get you almost anything.   "Life Line" This was my personal favorite story. It is the story about a man who discovers a way to tell exactly when a person will die. This story takes a look at our fear of death and how knowledge is not always a good thing. It also takes a quick jab at insurance companies and their greedy ways.  This was a very enjoyable collection from Heinlein, which I have come to expect. He truly is the master 
 Beginners seeking a user-friendly quilter's guide will find the vivid colors and unusual designs of M'Liss Rae Hawley's Get Creative! to be inviting. M'Liss provides only 8 projects to serve as a foundation for gathering skills, but each easy project offers important lessons in color and design and offers enough flexibility for beginners to incorporate their own designs and interests. A lovely collection of formulas and stories. 
 If you're not in the neighborhood to enjoy the gourmet meals at the Red Cat resaurant, this cookbook is the next best alternative. Beautiful photographs and fresh writing make it a joy to peruse. The directions are clear and encouraging to even a novice cook like me. This is the only cookbook I own that I actually read from cover to cover. Try the green beans tempura--you'll be hooked forever. And if you're in NYC, the Red Cat is worth going out of your way for 
 As good in 2007 as it was when published first time. There is no better introduction to Prolo 
 Alan G. Robinson and Dean M. Schroeder's IDEAS ARE FREE  is for employers who would tap into the riches of employee ideas and insights. Employees are quite opt to recognize both problems and opportunitiestheir managers pass by - but most organizations don't encourage sharing such insights, much less reward them. IDEAS ARE FREE: HOW THE IDEA REVOLUTION IS LIBERATING PEOPLE AND TRANSFORMING ORGANIZATIONS shows how to tap this hidden wealth. 
 Every couple of years I get so fed up with things I want to walk, even though I really enjoy management. Whenever my corporate world starts to resemble "Arrested Development," I read this book again. After almost ten yearts the book is falling apart after a lot of use. I have this book on tape and I keep it in the car.  Among all my books on management, and I've a whole shelf full of them, this remains my touchstone.  Note, though, the book is NOT by Michael Crichton; Crichton wrote the forward. 
 I saw Swan Lake my first time at City Center in New York, the Balanchine production of the 1950s.  I was awed, captivated, swept away.  I was about 6 years old.  I've seen many productions since, and they've often felt like museum pieces, stiff and starchy despite the best dancing. They haven't felt new or vital. This production left me gaping in wonder, even though the choreography wasn't always brilliant.  In fact, it was sometimes awkward and jarring, and that's a good thing. The music, the dazzling, shimmering, lustrous music, stood out in all its genius because the dancing made you listen as opposed to tapping your fingers one-two-three one-two-three.  There's nothing automatic or received here.  Then there's the dark psychological story line of repression battling psychic freedom, a story that doesn't always have a happy ending despite American expectations. I loved the male swans, especially Adam Cooper who was sensuous, powerful, hypnotic.  Have you ever been chased by a swan?  They are huge beasts, not merely lovely gliding figures on a lake or river.  This production captures them in all their danger and even ferocity, while offering a 50s version of a royal family too much in the public's eye.  This may not be the tidiest Swan Lake I've ever seen, but it's the most alive.  Terrific sets and costumes rounded out performance and an interpretation that left me tearful and stunned.  This is no war horse, it's a race horse.  And one more delightful note.  People here have complained about the cameras not always focusing on the dancing, the feet--but what that does is replicate one's experience in the balcony with opera glasses, watching feet, faces, hands, shifting to try to take it all in 
 Engelbert Humperdinck has been around for almost 40 years delighting his fans the globe over. And now with this his new cd, he has hit another home run. Laid back and fully in charge, Engelbert shows us why he is the King of Romance with this Jazz/Pop infused album. Several songs will become classics, such as "Love Songs" just beautiful, "There's No Good In Goodbye" a gem of a song, "My Confession" a new Enge classic, "With You I'm Born Again" an excellent song that will surely become a staple of Engelbert's concerts. Every song is performed with simple yet beautiful arrangements. A little Jazz mixed with Pop, this is a bold new step for Engelbert, and a good choice. Hopefully it will find a new public. I highly recommend this start of a new Engelbert era! 
 Andreas continues to demonstrate his facility with the human form in dynamic composition.  Unfortunately, the cover is by far the most exquisite image.  
   I came home from kindergarten every day and watched Julia while I had my cookies and milk; when this book came out my mother and I started cooking in earnest from it. Julia wrote this just for people taking the first serious plunge into the kitchen and you will need other cookbooks, but this one taught me several good things.  First, the basics of serious cooking at the age of ten. Second, how to read instructions and follow them. I have overhauled tractor engines because Julia Child taught me basic cooking as a small child. It's a lot of the same critical thinking and ability to read an instruction manual. It's still a simple enough cook book though.   So that's where this book really shines, as a great start for novice cooks and a good reference for a lot of classic recipes. I still think it's good for the kids too. Mine are experimenting with it at ages ten and twelve. Why waste time on underpowered kiddy cookbooks when a pared down classic will do the job so much better? I still grab it for quick and easy dinner and I highly recommend it for anyone taking the first plunge into the kitchen. 
 To walk in another's shoes is what Sonia Nazario brings to this expose. The story  follows a 17 year old boy as he travels the illegal immigrants path from Honduras to the United States. The book is an expansion on the Pulitzer Prize winning LA times articles by Ms. Nazario. She finds that many young single mothers leave Central America to find work in the United States. They don't want to do this but are forced to by economic necessity. To coin a phrase.... Without jobs they will come. Then years later their children hunger to find their Mother's and follow them to the U. S. The route, retraced here, has them riding the tops of rail cars, dancing around gangs, attacks, robberies, corrupt police in Mexico, immigrant haters in Mexico, all on a journey they may attempt many times before success. Enrique's personal story is a metaphor for all these poor underprivileged seekers of economic salvation. It's an ugly story and an ugly situation which Nazario sums up in an excellent recap at the end of the book. Being from CA I was struck by the statistic that "An average nonimmigrant household in California paid $1,178 more in state and local taxes than the value of the services they received. Conversely, immigrant households paid $3,463 less than the value of the services they received..." No doubt that these poor are a drain on our system but when personalized the way Enrique's story is here one can only feel empathy for these individuals. The answer? Well that is not really the subject of this story. But it certainly appears that more jobs and economic opportunity and labor rights in Latin America should be the centerpiece of American policy. This is an excellent and interesting perspective on a subject of current national interest 
 I received this book as a present when I was about nine. Although it took me a while to get the gist of the directions, I eventually mastered all the stitches and projects presented, and without adult help! The book presents the instructions as clearly as possible; if somebody cannot understand them, its because boondoggle as a craft requires some dexterity and spatial reasoning skills. Not unlike origami. So, if your child is used to immediate payoff, don't purchase this book. If, on the other hand, s/he can handle some disasters along the way of learning how to do this craft (and developing some useful mechanics along the way), I recommend it 
 This is a great soundtrack.  It is very upbeat and has a great mix of styles of music.  Nothing is too far over the top.  I was pleased to find that most of the songs that I had heard during the movie are indeed on the soundtrack.  If there is 1 song that you like from the movie and don't know whether or not to buy this album, know that this is a soundtrack you shouldn't hesitate to buy 
 When Gertrude Bell was helping draw the lines for what is now present day Iraq it was about oil then and it's about oil now. Anyone wanting to understand a little bit about the culture of the Middle East should read this. A very interesting book about the female "Lawrence of Arabia." 
 Separating fact from fiction in history is problematic at best. Religious history is especially difficult as there are many stakeholders propogating certain lines of belief and practice. McRae's book strips away much of the mythology of the development of Chan/Zen from the time of Bodhidharma through to the Song Dynasty (ca. 950-1300) in China. This demythologizing is sure to upset some Zen practioners and teachers whose faith in Zen Buddhism is intimately tied to an idealised version of Zen's history. McRae not only presents a refreshing view of the Chan lineage charts and their role in the development of Zen's history, but also gives a detailed analysis of the Northern/Southern Schools split and the development of "encounter dialogues", which laid the foundation for koans.  Along the way, he takes a swipe at Heinrich Dumoulin's interpretation of Zen history, the Platform Sutra as history (it never happened), and even the idea that Chan was a distinct and separate Buddhist school in ancient China. For  those whose faith is based on these colourful but historically inaccurate myths, this book will be troubling and thought-provoking. McRae and other academics in the field are providing a valuable service to Buddhism's migration from the East to the West and books such as this one should be required reading in Zen centres around the world. McRae tackles the issues with a light touch and even non-experts in the field should have little difficulty in reading this. I highly recommend this book to all who are interested in Zen's true history.  (... 
 I already read it several times and I think I will read it again sometime.   It's a fun novel, besides, folklore collections and ancient Chinese fiction, presenting a real world through imaginary stories. I don't know about others, but I found myself in this book: sometimes I am the priest, sometimes I am the pig and sometimes I am the monkey...   PS: It's one of the so called '4 Chinese ancient classics' (other 3 are A Dream of Red Mansions, Outlaws of the Marsh and Three Kingdoms)   
 Investors who want to survive need to avoid torpedo stocks - the one's you don't see coming to blow a hole in your portfolio. This requires arming yourself with a healthy skepticism. Your stock analyst may be under pressure not to disrupt investment banking deals with negative reports. The auditor's independent review may be compromised by a desire to secure "fat fees" for a host of additional advisory services. Bottom line: Investors need to trust in their own abilities and do the job of reading corporate reports themselves. Read the annual report and more detailed SEC required 10-K filing. This is the simple message of QUALITY OF EARNINGS. Interpreting trends in accounts receivable and inventory levels from publicly available reports are useful tools to spot problems before they impact a stock's price. This is the author's "most important" chapter and it is as good a discussion as I have seen on the subject. The importance of understanding accounting practice changes and their immediate impact on how earnings are reported is another important matter that gets attention here. We also see why "big bath" restructuring charges that lower the bar for short term earnings growth expectations have become a predictable consequence of corporate acquisitions and CEO transitions. Much of this material will be familiar to readers of more current books on the topic, but O'glove's clear explanations and use of the numbers to support his conclusions are instructive. Because this book was written in 1987 the majority of examples used are quaint at best (e.g., Church's Fried Chicken, Coleco, Adademy Insurance Group, etc.). On the other hand, describing accounting changes at IBM or GE's managed use of tax losses through its Credit Corporation unit (GECC) may resonate rather differently with today's wary investor. A chapter dealing with dividends, the "tender trap", reflects recent, not current, thinking. O'glove's position is that "minimal or no dividends" is the best corporate policy. It is a fair discussion. This has been a general consensus for years because of the issues of double taxation and a conviction that capital can be more efficiently employed in a company's core business development. Currently, in the throes of a bear stock market, investors have sought dividend bearing stocks to hedge market volatility, as a tangible sign of legitimate profits (showmethemoney) when accounting scandals are discovered, and more broadly as way of supplementing retirement income. Preferences change, but one thing is certain. The issue of transparency in the markets is critical to assessing value. This book is an excellent introduction to the topic 
 This is one of my favorite Cd's.It is mellow and memory provoking 
 Any concerned about America's changing relations with world nations should take a look at BEYOND THE AGE OF INNOCENCE: A WORLDLY VIEW OF AMERICA. Mahbubani expresses anguish over the deepening distrust and resentment of this country: he's a leading Asian diplomat who gets to observe this first-hand. He chides this nation on its indifference to its decisions on others - and advocates recognizing and alleviating the growing gap between America and the rest of the world - and shows how. It's his ability to point out alternative directions and how to reach them which makes BEYOND THE AGE OF INNOCENCE a special recommendation.  Diane C. Donovan California Bookwatch 
 The story of Oliver Twist, written by Charles Dickens, is a classic bildungsroman, about the difficulties a child had to endure to survive in the 1800's. Dickens satirizes the atrocious trait of human selfishness by illustrating how it comprises ones humanity as the helpless and vulnerable are victimized for personal gain. Oliver Twist is an orphan from a small village not far from London, who is forced into social conventions by a city council. He escapes his horrible captor, a woman who steals food money for her personal use, but unfortunately lands in the hands of a criminal mastermind, who forces him to pickpocket in the London streets. He luckily is taken under the loving care of a family who gains the information of Oliver's previous captor. Many scenes are dedicated to the fallout of this criminal family which proves that with a positive environment, people are able to succeed in life. Oliver Twist has been around for nearly 200 years and I found it a very good novel, not only for its content but also for its moral truths. It is interesting because it allows children and young adults to imagine what life was like back then and to contrast their lives to Oliver's. This realization allows the reader to see that some people have more difficult lives then others and to not take advantage of them 
 I love this book.  I listened to it on tape.  The storey started out a tiny bit slow but oh is the story good!  I recommend this book to anyone who likes romance, not real graphic but very sweet, and suspense.  Oh this book is so good.  Hammond Cross is the ideal man and Dr. Lad is just as sweet and classy as can be.  The end is the best.  Hammond struggles with doing what is right and what is ethical.  Very good book!  Two thumbs up to Ms. Brown! 
 Reilly Ace of Spies is an excellent set of British television drama. Beyond that, it is well written, very well acted and very well directed to give a sense of time and place. More so because it is actually based on the life of Sidney Reilly, a turn-of-the-century British intelligence agent.  Besides being a tight action drama in the class of many British classics, in presenting the Reilly storyline, the set gives us a lesson in history, but one not only captivating and interesting, but also educational.  This set is well worth the price and well worth the viewing. It may also render some view of the problems in the Middle East that we deal with today and why we deal with them 
  There have been emblematic films that plainly, justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment. But few times, we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness, constancy and dedication like this one.   We should be back to the times if Silkwood or The China syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health; that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions    On the other hand of the coin, (and I must confess I have never been a special fan of Mrs. Roberts) she displayed by far,  the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the Academy Award that year.  One more thing: in order to the fairness, I would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance: Ellen Burstyn and "Requiem for a dream". And that I keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between Barbara Streisand and Vanessa Redgrave in 1967, where the difference in what acting concerns was even major.     Excellent edition and magisterial direction of Steven Soderbergh.  
 I've considered other, higher priced digital SLRs, such as the Nikon D80 and Canon 30D.  However, I decided that I probably won't be using some of the more advanced features offered by those cameras, and would rather spend the money saved on a better lens.  In terms of picture quality, all these SLRs are capable of equivalent quality.  Currently I have 3 lenses, the kit 18-55mm, the 50mm f/1.8, and the 85mm f/1.8.  I don't use the kit zoom lens anymore because I favor the faster, prime lenses.  I mostly take pictures of my children, and the 85mm f/1.8 is an excellent portrait lens.  It is sharp, fast, and produces beautiful background blur.  Zoom lenses unfortunately are not as sharp or fast, unless you're willing to pay much more than the cost of the camera body.  I think all novice SLR owners should buy the cheap Canon 50mm f/1.8, to discover what a fast lens can do when you set the aperture to 1.8, and take some portraits.  You too can have professional-looking results 
 This is my #1 album of all time. Hands down. I cannot be without this album for more than 1 week, and it's been out for 8 years. I love it so much that I've given away 5 copies of it to friends and relatives, and rebought it within a day or two every time. Don't miss out. Buy it now. NOW! Thank you for reading my review 
 This book is heavy on the illustrations. That being said, it is NOT necessarily light on information.  In particular, I was VERY pleased with how well balanced the very subject of pirate biographies was treated. There are sections of the book dedicated to each major geographical region, as well as to different time periods.  It lightly glosses over the subjects of ships, weaponry, practices, flags, and strongholds (for better coverage of these things, try Benerson Little's Sea Rover's Practice), but gives a great deal of general biographical information on many different famous pirates from the Indian Ocean, Far East, Caribbean, and even on back into the "Ancient World."  For general reference in a well-balanced delivery, with plenty of attention given to other-than-Caribbean and other-than-late-17th-century piracy, I recommend no other book more 
 Chen Kaige creates another period masterpiece with TEMPTRESS MOON, the story of a wealthy family struggling to maintain their history on the outskirts of Shanghai.  Due to her brother's condition resulting from an addiction to opium (or so we're lead to believe), Ruyi (the ever glowing Gong Li) is granted leadership over the family fortune at a time when women were relegated to secondary roles.  However, Zhongliang -- a close relation now grown up and playing a con man to perfection in Shanghai -- returns home to bilk her out of the family fortune at the demand of his boss.  When Zhongliang discovers he has fallen in love with her, he chooses to alter her fate ... but his choice only secures his own fate in the eyes of the triad he serves.  MOON is wonderfully photographed, though this image transfer is a bit grainy at times.  It is a contemporary 'Romeo & Juliet,' with gangland influences and wonderful period photography.  The lovemaking -- while pushing the boundaries in a mainstream foreign release -- is relatively tame but beautiful captured with powerful emotion and vivid lighting.  At points, the film feels almost like a narrative valentine to the family and the viewer; but don't look for any happy ending here.  The ending poses a small handful of tight flashbacks that gives new meaning to some of the events depicted in the film, defining more greatly the motivations of the main characters, once again demonstrating how meaningful small decisions are in the pursuit of daily life and how tragic their consequences may inevitably be in the day, months, and years ahead.  While it arguably may be a bit hard to follow at times, TEMPTRESS MOON nonetheless delivers as a truly spectacular, moving experience that should not be missed 
 My 3,1/2 year old daughter has intractable epilepsy that has been unresponsive to drug treatment, and has experienced very [VERY}undesirable side effects from anti-epileptic drugs [aeds] Hayven has been on the ketogenic diet for 4 months now. Although she is not seizure free, we have noticed about a 65% decrease in her overall seizure activity. She used to have 12-25 "drop" [atonic]seizures a day, with almost constant "pulsing, bucking, rythmic activity' [myoclonus] Since the diet she is down to 1-2 "drops' and almost no myoclonic activity. This movie paints a very realistic picture of the lives effected by this disorder. Although I never had to get on a plane against medical advice to take my child far away for treatment, I have had to literally SCREAM at the doctors and advocate for my childs best interests. We have been fortunate enough to have found a child neurology clinic 12 miles from home where they readily offer the diet as treatment, and our particular doctor [who we had to wait 2 years to see due to the red-tape of insurance companies [[[don't even get me started!!]]]] has already started to wean her off of the 3 aeds she is currently on. This diet is very labor intensive and strict, and I can't say that is has been a picnic, but the truth is that it IS worth a try. It is helping us tremendously even though is has also been a source of severe stress.  I recommend this movie to family and friends, and care givers of epileptic patients, and I will be sending this film to Hayven's grandparents to watch so they can have a "true-life" visual of a portion of what it is like to deal with this condition 
 The other reviews here use enough glowing adjectives that I won't add many more, but it will suffice to say this is a dramatic and epic color monograph. Those of you who are consumers of the imagery in National Geographic will experience more than a few flashes of recognition as you page through the sumptuous images in this book. Unlike on the pages of national geo, however, this book gives Steve's images the chance to stand alone, independent of editorial and other clutter on the page, and in this singular treatment it is easy to recognize them for what they are: exceptional color photography, and exceptional pieces of art. Whether you have traveled to southeast asia in body or in mind, you will find these images deep and resounding, worth many hours of leisurely flipping. If you are a color photographer, you will stop and stare with admiration, remembering again why you carry a camera 
 The fullness of this book with its approach of the multiple intelligence holistic view of how we all....not only children...can learn in fun ways is awesome. The book is visually appealing and the information is easily accessed when researching ideas.  It does not surprise me that the book meets so many needs in such a creative manner, as my experience with YogaKids has been and continues to be such a creative and encouraging journey.  Thank you Marsha for once again inspiring the work that is so helpful to children and society at large 
 I read this book in December 2004 - without an instrument in hand cause at that time I was at my aunts place in which she does not have a piano. Now from starting out in 2005 with ' Easy Piano Notation ' style music books to Standard notation, which is where I am going at right now 2006, to me that is amazing. I blame my fast - high speed learning mostly from this book, Learn to Read Music by Howard Shanet. Before several years ago, I tried to learn how to play the piano, and failed. Wrong teacher - maybe and most likely and no desire to want to play. Now 30 years later, and especially after reading this book by Mr. Shanet, I have to admit, I was lacking the fundamentals of Music reading - 30 years ago. 
 The main character is a paranoid, out of order, lock in, mathamatician that never stops calculating. But hold on, there's more to the story. This guy is also an envelope pusher. When the movie starts, we realize that his character is not all together there. He has frequent headaches and nightmares. Could be due to his condition: when he was a little boy he stared up into the sun for a dangerous amount of time. the doctors say that his pupils dialated to the size of pin holes. But that's not what the story is about. The story is really about a set of numbers. No one really knows what it is.  One says it's random computer junk. Another thinks it's part of a code. One thinks it could help figure out the stock market. A group of people think that it is a code for the actual name of God.  The real insanity comes from just knowing that the code exsists. That's what the character goes through. If it is not a numerial code for good . . .could it be a numerial code for evil?  Full of intrigue, suspense, and an interest in math.  the movie is in full black and white.  Really wierd camera angles as well as some messed up scenes. Soundtrack is also weird, like from the twighlight zone. Rent it, if anything else.  Enjoy 
 No need for words as the music & its performances speak for themselves. The only knock I give it...it's not long enough by today's standards. I've owned on vinyl with 3 cd versions, original-remastered and MFSL and never get tired of listening to this and Blow by Blow.  Jeff...help us with all the crap out there and try to revive this even you're outspoken on this being not your best work. Millions disagree with you. Knock off the sounds effects, techno-esque, motor revving dubs and PLAY.  
 Paul Johnson, the Catholic Journalist and Writer,  gives an excellent narrative history of the Jewish people in this book over a timespan which ranges from the age of the patriarchs to the late 20th century.  Thankfully, being a good writer whose style is not dry and scholarly, Johnson is able to bring the Jews and key Jewish figures to life.  He has a good sense for what is interesting and important, and what esoteric material can be left aside for the specialist scholar.    Overall this is one of his best narrative histories.  
 There are some Pilates programs out there that don't give you results.  They are geriatric and wimpy.  I have been a client of the IM=X Pilates method for a few years and tried it at a couple of gyms. I just noticed they started a franchise chain.  IM=X is a superior workout that has proven to give me results.  I purchased this book and can't wait to see how the new mens format works.  The regular IM=X format kicks my butt.  
 Ethan M. Rasiel was a consultant with McKinsey & Company. Paul N. Friga is Professor at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business where he teaches strategy and management consulting. Paul worked in McKinsey's Pittsburgh-office.  In 1999 Ethan Rasiel published "The McKinsey Way", which I did see as an introduction into McKinsey and management consulting in general. That book touched on the problem-solving tools and techniques used by McKinsey. However, this book takes a much more prescriptive approach and discusses the problem-solving model in much more detail. This problem-solving model consists of six discrete elements: 1. business need; 2. analyzing; 3. presenting; 4. managing; 5. implementation; 6. leadership. "There is one other piece of the model: the tension between intuition and data." Each element is discussed within this book, apart from client/business needs, implementation and leadership.  Chapters 1-to-4 discusses McKinsey's fact-based, hypothesis-driven problem-solving process and how you can use this process to tackle problems in your own organization. Chapter 5 discusses strategies for presentation to your boss, clients, the board, or your entire company. Chapter 6-to-8 discuss the management of the problem-solving processes, with a particular focus on managing the team, the client and yourself. Each chapter is divided into an introduction, a summary of the lessons from "The McKinsey Way", lessons from McKinsey alumni,and advice for implementation. There are also some exercises at the end of each chapter. The three appendices provide useful links to data-gathering resources, a summary list of lessons from "The McKinsey Way", and a summary lis of the implementation lessons from this book.  Yes, I do like this book better than "The McKinsey Way". "The McKinsey Way" should be seen as an introduction into McKinsey, their tools and techniques, this book focuses on putting those tools and techniques into practice. I believe that this book can help you become a better problem solver and decision maker, using the approach discussed in the book. If you have little time, try to read at least Chapter 1 which is possibly the best chapter in the book since its sets up/frames the problem solving method. Highly recommended for people looking to problem-solving tools and techniques. However, the hard work is still up to you 
 i suggest u read the rewritten nancy drews you need to give them a try. they are as exiting and suspenceful as this exiting mystery!!!!!! 
 Asked to come home by her family Washington D.C. based children's rights lobbyist Rose Fletcher drives to Mullins, South Carolina though she prefers not to go.  As the miles pass, she reflects back on decisions she made that feel hollow and dishonest no matter how she rationalizes them.  Rose thinks about what caused the estrangement with her mother and fears a confrontation when they see one another.  She ponders why she deceived her husband, who believes they are trying to have a baby instead of telling him she is not ready for a child. She secretly used birth control to insure she does not become pregnant.  Besides which, since she is having an affair, short of DNA testing, she would not who sired her offspring.  Feeling morally bankrupt, Rose considers how to regain the high road she used to travel in her relationships.  Rose being a paradox of conflict makes for a fascinating look at a woman whose moral compass is pointing in a negative direction.  Though readers will wonder why she failed to fly home, which would have somewhat devastated the premise of the open road meeting of stereotypical people, fans will appreciate her self analysis via flashbacks as to how each of her key relationships have recently been filled by mendacity on her part.  FLIES ON THE BUTTER is a deep character study of how easy a person can make wrong decisions because in the short run that is the easier path to take.  Harriet Klausner 
 Although Eugene O'Neill saw much success as an author during his lifetime-being awarded three Pulitzer Prizes in 1920, 1921, and 1925, and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1929-his finest work, Long Day's Journey Into Night, was not published until 1956, three years after his death. This was due to its autobiographical nature, and the painful portrait that it paints of the O'Neill family. It earned him his fourth Pulitzer Prize in 1957.  The play is organized into four acts: the morning, afternoon, evening, and night of a pivotal day for the Tyrone family (representative of the O'Neills). The characters of Mary, James, Jamie and Edmund (representing Eugene O'Neill's mother, his father, his brother, and himself, respectively) are seen early in the first act as a loving and supportive family. However, as the day progresses, severe problems such as drug addiction, alcoholism, depression, and infectious disease are alluded to in increasing detail, which causes the play to be captivatingly suspenseful. Throughout the first few acts, each time a character lets a detail about a problem slip, another character is quick to either silence, or dismiss them. I find that O'Neill's talent truly comes through in his ability to portray the complexities of the characters through their interactions. He expertly contrasts their powerful love for one another with the bitter resentment they feel as a result of their very difficult lives. The play seems to fall at a point where all the characters are at the ends of their emotional ropes. They frequently snap at each other, making scathingly hurtful remarks, then, upon realizing their indiscretion, lovingly seek to make reparations. Their emotional interactions seem so genuine that they remind me rather heartbreakingly of my own family (minus the addictions and diseases of course).  Though O'Neill's use of dialogue is at times poignant, I find that the source of my great sympathy for the characters comes mostly from their actions. Luckily for those of us who have not had the fortune of seeing the play performed, O'Neill includes detailed and eloquently written stage directions that enable us to picture the action. He includes every important fact, from the characters' facial expressions and voices, to the details of their movements.  Though I found the tragic story of O'Neill's family to be painful to read at times, I admire his courage at displaying it to the world, even if he did wait until he had died to do so. 
 It is an understatement to say there is now a plethora of new so-called "conspiracy" books flooding the market. These are easily divided into two categories -- first, a category which encompasses the great majority of such books, a hasty rehash of material which has been shamelessly lifted from a number of older works and melded into a "new" look at conspiracies; and second, a book which offers a genuinely useful examination of the conspiracy material in circulation. "Project Seek" must be included in the second, and much rarer, category. The author, Gerald A. Carroll, has credentials that many conspiracy writers lack. He is an accepted member of the academic community, who also has had 20 years of experience with a number of leading newspaper companies in the United States. "Project Seek" is a serious examination of the well-known Gemstone Files, which have circulated since 1975. Carroll has employed his considerably journalistic skills to weave the material from the Gemstone Files into a comprehensive explanation of contemporary history. He makes an impressive contribution to out understanding of the "nether-world" of modern history by exposing the role of Aristotle Onassis and other shadowy figures as key players in such events as the John F. Kennedy assassinatio 
 From the mesmerizing first chapter I was hooked.  This is an adventure that makes you want to turn the pages quickly.  I've noted that others have characterized this book as "bland," yet, isn't that the point?  To truly feel the emotional palate of the characters, there can't be a big surprise at every corner.  If you finish this book feeling confused, depressed, and a little hungry for her next book, then this author has done her job.  If you like "cookie cutter" stories, then this book isn't for you 
 Unfortunately, this compilation's producdrs failed to include such beauties as "I Can't Stand The Pain", "Put Our Heads Together" and the majestic "Extraordinary Girl" on this budget-priced CD. Not one of the O'Jays 1983-86 hits was included here...as a result you can't consider it truly definitive. Most of the songs here, however, are great--it would have been nice,though, to have more of their mid-to-late 1980s PIR hits here 
 Unbelievable.  I was a skeptical, heavy smoker for more than 20 years, and I've been quit now for more than two months.  I tried and did not quit with many other methods.    Allen's way WAS EASY.  I swear.  I've NEVER written a book review before, but felt compelled to share with others.  In fact, I've even bought four other copies for friends.    I had no withdrawals, no regrets and no cravings.  I kept the ideas he said to keep in mind, and like magic, I quit and loved every moment of it.  He tought me how to be and think like a non-smoker again (as we all are born).  It does feel more natural.  The key?  Knowing, feeling and believing (which I found out was true) that being and feeling like a non-smoker, is waaaaaaaaaaay better than how I 'though' smoking made me feel (good).  I can't explain any more than that, but it did change my thinking dramatically.  He takes the way we all as smokers 'think' about ourselves and our smoking, and turns quitting into a positive.  Not the negative that most smokers who want to quit, think of it as.  By the time you're half way through the book, you are joyful at the excitement you have at how great you're going to feel when you quit.  And it just continues!  AND I DO FEEL GREAT.  HE HELPS YOU TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT QUITTING AND TAKES AWAY THE FEAR.  Go ahead, buy it. You will be elated that you did!  
 This book is a complete sacred sex course in itself. With lots of meditations, activities, and exercises, it is particularly suited for couples who want to open up to each other emotionally as well as physically 
 This is a book you do not want to finish, you constantly wish that as you progress in your reading as the book will unfold in more pages. It does not happen. What a life story, full of art and style. What a charming book,  simple and direct. Easy to read but so full of references to the Art of  this Century.  Peggy lived and tell the life of a brilliant collector not  only of art pieces but of emotions and feelings. To me this is one of the  best books of the year. It goes on top of DV by Diana Vreeland on my  nightstand 
 This book was a book about trying to kill the witches! The narrator (his name is not stated in the book) is about 7 years old at the time and his parents died, so he lived with his grandmother. His grandmother was an expert when it came to witches. She told him that witches are bald (so they wear wigs), their tongue is blue, they have no toes, they have a keen sense of smell, and they have no fingernails (so they wear gloves). His grandmother also tells him about the Grand High Witch, which is the ruler of all the witches. Every year, they have a meeting. Witches hate children, so they use many different methods to kill them. Summer comes and the narrator's grandmother decides to take him to Hotel Magnificent.(They were supposed to go to Norway, but his grandmother is too sick to go so faraway.) Before they leave, he is given two mice he names the girl, Mary, and the boy, William. He is caught bringing the mice and the manager doesn't allow mice, so, he has to keep them in the cage. One day, he sneaks to a meeting room and hides there to play with his mice. That's where the witches' meeting was. The narrator is caught and is turned into a mouse with their new medicine the "Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker". Then, his grandmother finds out and they take the "Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker" and put it in all the witches' soup. At the end, the witches are all gone and the narrator and his grandmother live happily ever after. I liked this book because I thought it was very creative! Like in this part it says: "'Don't interrupt, " she said. "Just take it all in. The second thing to remember is that a REAL WITCH is always bald.'" Also, this book is a very fun book. Just like in this part: "No witch would be stupid enough to leave anything suspicious lying around for the hotel maid to see." I didn't like the book because I thought it was a bit disgusting. Just like the ingredients for the Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker. It says: "Tventy-vun hours of boiling, " answered The Grand High Witch. "And while this is going on, you take exactly forty-five brrrown mice and you chop off their tails vith a carving-knife and you fry the tails in hair-oil until they are nice and crrrisp." My favorite part of the book is the ending because it's happy and everyone can relax at the end 
 This film is Pier Paolo Pasolini's testament. It has not aged one iota and is even probably better now than it used to be. The first strong element is that it has to do with sex, the body and the use of the body for all kinds of sexual activities and pleasures. But onanism is out. Sex is always an activity that connects at least two people, more often than less a lot more than two if you include the voyeurs. The film is turning our voyeurism into a saturated mental ability though strangely enough the film remains extremely prudish as for actually showing the sexual intercourse and the torturing that is to come sooner or later. In fact when he wants for us to « see » the men with erections he keeps them trousered so that you can only see a form which is not an organ per se. Only one erection is really shown but because it is the slave who has an erection after having given anal sex to his master and torturer turned here into the dominated partner. This erection is not like in all other draped or wrapped up cases the evidence of the pleasure of some men in front of some humiliation imposed to other boys and girls, hence a sadistic though passive pleasure. In this case it is the domination of the master by the slave who could have strangled him in a couple of minutes and didn't because he does not need to rebel : he has already conquered real power over the master for conquering his backside. In other words Pasolini still plays a tremendous lot with our voyeurism by not showing the real thing, but still keeping the act itself covered up, dissimulated, hidden. Note this dimension of seeing the physical excitement of the young boys and girls strutting in front of us in the nude and quasi-nude on the screen is only possible with the boys for very organic reasons. But the second level of the film is the political fable or parable. Yes fascism is tremendously present in our consciousness and life. But probably not this kind of fascism which is to alienate a human being to the point when he has lost all existence in society and thus can become raw material with which you can play at leisure in three stages : passions, excrements and fatal suffering. Note the passions are those of the masters imposed onto the slaves who are shown as mostly moving along and even getting into the game with quite a lot of willingness. There are many slaves who are happy in the society that makes them slaves. Note the excrements can come from anywhere and it is a pleasure for the masters to eat them and to impose their being eaten to the slaves and here again, maybe in a more difficult way, some slaves take to it, clearly this time in some kind of resilient desire to survive if it requires such a drastic diet. It is true that a kiss of two male mouths that have both eaten some feces has some kind of a pungent taste and even attractiveness in its very kinkiness. Note fatal suffering, torturing someone to death is this time definitely one way : the masters are torturing some of the slaves and using the others to help them achieve their pleasure. This time you find out that some will be totally willing to take part in the torture of another one if it enables them to avoid the torture for themselves. This is definitely a heritage from the Shoah and how the Nazis had managed to make prisoners their anciliary servants in the very task of eliminating them all. It is by the way the only reason why there were some survivors. Among slaves there will always be some who will collaborate with the masters even in the torturing and killing of the others provided it protects them from the same fate, or at least pushes that fate slightly forward into the future. There Pasolini becomes prophetic. And when the film stops on two surviving fifteen year old boys dancing together on some American sounding music and exchanging the names of their girlfriends we have a sad gospel about the true nature of humanity. Domination, power, cruelty, brutality are one side of all human beings. This side will be dominant as soon as circumstances permit. Then the majority who will be deprived of this power will divide easily between those who will collaborate to survive a little bit longer and those who will not or will be chosen not to resist at all and will become the raw material of the desires of the powerful. So these boys and girls will not sound or look as what their age should make them sound and look. They will have been transformed in our consciousness into some kind of lurking monsters who are roaming in the back of each man's skull and definitely on the retinas of all our eyes. We are all ready to accept suffering if it means pleasure and we are all ready to inflict suffering and death to others because it will mean pleasure for us. Pasolini had a tremendously sombre vision of humanity and it is a good thing this film has come back to life after nearly thirty years of clandestinity.

 One of the better features of this product is that it does not contain so many other kinds of chemicals or additives as do many other olive oil soaps. My wife and I have been using a variety of olive oil soaps for quite a few years. We find that olive oil keeps our skin healthy with plenty of moisture. We don't use the typical name brand non-olive soaps because they have a tendency to dry the skin. The only negative about this soap is the distinct smell, probably from the aloe. Nevertheless, we believe users will be pleased with this soap 
   A Chair For My Mother, by Vera Williams(More, More, More Said the Baby) is about a young girl who's home was recently damaged by a fire, leaving the whole area a dull charcoal color.  They paint the walls yellow and a few family members and friends pitch in to make to house nicer than it was after the fire, but still all the chairs in the house are burned and, as I would imagine, very uncomfortable.      This is where the title comes in.  The girl, her mother, and grandmother start saving loose change to help buy a new chair for the girl's hardworking mother.  About a year later they have the money  and exchange it for ten dollar bills at the bank.  They finaly have a new, rose-covered chair.    The simplistic illustrations enhance the books warmth and make this book and easy read for bored readers 
 This was the first "Lost" book I've ever purchased and I was not disappointed. My personal favorite part was the summaries of the show's literary references. Really interesting stuff. The amount of detail in this book is astounding. Anything you could ever hope to know about the first two seasons is in here. R.I.P. Boone 
 This is a beautifully written work of theology, drawing us more deeply into the mystery of the Trinity through the Divine Liturgy.  In Part I, Jean Corbon delves into the Mystery of the Liturgy revealed through the life of Christ and the Church.  Then, in part II, he unfolds the beauty of the Liturgy Celebrated.  Part III reveals "The Liturgy Lived", emphasizing how the Eucharist is an integral part of human daily living, "the mystery of the river of life that streams from the Father and the Lamb ..." (137).  Jean Corbon assists the reader by providing a key to liturgical vocabulary; and, this book has only 200 pages 
 I think these are two of the best performances you can get of these two great works. Rafael Kubelik's performances are always underrated for some reason, and these this recording makes a strong case for this trend being reversed. I think two of they standout movements. Are the finale of The Eighth Symphony and The Opening Movement of The Ninth. In both these movements a precise amount of playing is mixed with almost flawless attacks to make it very thrilling. The Ninth Symphony First movement has one of the most exciting openings (next to Mahler 5) and It is played very musically with a good amount of rebate. The Largo is very beautiful and of course the finale is hair raising. I would highly recommend getting this disc especially at such a nice price 
 Some notes before i begin: I've collected WHR in seperate DVDs, not the full collection, so im not sure what this particular set includes. However, i got the following with the first DVD/box in the set: Shot Glass (little beer drinking glass is what i think they're for, the anime has alot to do with a certain bar/resturant called Harry's.) Witch Hunter Robin T-shirt CD Soundtrack (note: there are 2 seperate soundtracks as i found out later on).  Anyway, the anime is very well written, but like alot of different animes, it may be confusing at first, but once you get the hang of whats going on, the story flows really well. Things will start to clear up and "story holes" will begin to be filled in by the 4th DVD. If you like horror related animes, this one is deffinutly for you. I also do not recommend this for kids 12 and under, it may give them nightmares.   Hope this helps you 
 In this book Rand presents, for the first time, a fully objective theory of concept formation. This second edition contains much material not available in the first. As an appendix, we have the pleasure of seeing her mind at work as she answers questions from philosophers, mathematicians and physicists. This book is essential to understand Objectivism, and should be read along with Peikoff's book on Objectivism 
 I have two favorite authors, first is Frank Herbert, and second is Robert A. Heinlein.  Here's something that you should know.  Starship Troopers -- THE MOVIE, shouldn't even share the same name.  That movie is nothing like the book.  There are a few of the same characters, a few of the same conversations, and that's about it.  If you don't eventually read this book, you might suffer from stupidity 
 I am just started in embroidering on greeting cards.  This book has helped me alot with different stitches than the normal ones I see others doing in this craft 
 Tv on the radio have a very, very different sound to them. I can't listen to this cd enough. There are so many great songs. My favorite is ambulance, but dreams and don't love you are tied for second. All the other songs are awesome too. You should definitely pick this cd up and give it a listen if only to experience something different and for some songs that will stick in your head for a few days. This is a very worthwhile cd and I highly reccomend it 
 I thought Betty Crocker would be too old-fashioned for me, but this book is excellent for beginning cooks. True to its title, this book isn't simply full of recipes for you to blindly follow. Instead it provides actual instructions and tips that apply to whatever you may cook. Examples? Margarine that is too soft will lead to flattened cookies, storing fresh herbs in oil creates risk for botulism food poisoning and a kitchen towel may help you remove mussels from the shells. This may be obvious information for experienced chefs, but for a young woman like myself, it is a great advice.  This book makes cooking less intimidating and creates great kitchen habits that can last a lifetime. I highly recommend it!

 This book is a masterpiece of a collections of all the known analytical method applied to heat conduction. A must buy and collectable classic 
 I have read quite a few books about Oscar Wilde, both biographical and fictional. But, I must say that "Judas Kiss", written by a very talented David Hare, seems to be the best among the plays.  The minute I started reading this book, I felt better about not having a chance to see  the play on Broadway, with an incredible Liam Neeson as late Oscar Wilde.  Hare's playwriting ability is so powerful, that I was able to re-create  theater stage, the story happening on it, and even Liam Neeson himself. In  terms of its narrrative, "Judas Kiss" takes somewhat  non-traditional look at the last few months of Oscar Wilde's life in Italy.  It is well-documented that prison changed him greatly in spirit and in  body, and that he came out physically and spiritually weaker than ever.  But, wait and see what Hare has to say about this as well as about Bosie's  presence in Wilde's life after prison, among other things 
 If you are a beginner in .NET ( not to be confused with a beginner programmer ) this book is excellent. Unfortunately for me, I have been using .NET for several years. SO there we're only pieces here and there that I could use. But, he goes into extreme detail on every aspect for .NET. I love the book.  Its a must for at least a reference book. At the very least.  And by the way I dont do practice examples, I make my own. So if there are examples I have no idea if they work or not. And a books weight has nothing to do with some examples that the author thought up, while cashing his check!  Nic 
 College Prowler books are well worth the investment for students and parents investigating colleges.  They give a detailed picture of the school, written from current students' perspectives.  Once you have narrowed your list of schools to 10 or fewer, I would recommend buying the College Prowler titles for all of those.  It's a small investment compared to the cost of visiting the campus, application fees, and -- of course -- TUITION!   
 I have used the largest one in a 18" high and 12" high tank and in both applications this ornament looks great.  I now have it in my 10gal guppy breeding tank that includes some dwarf crayfish and Thai crabs.  I lay it down horizontally, and the shellfish love crawling in and around this item, while the guppy's love to swim over around and through its branches.  every time I clean my tank, I turn and lay this ornament down in a different position to give my tank inhabitants a whole new terrain to explore.  if a leg breaks off it's easy to super-glue it back on and continue to use it immersed.  over long periods of abrasion against a particular area, the white from the plaster resin will show through the natural textured paint job, but the whole item is light and gray enough for the white not to be a distraction.  the top is mostly hollow with 2 side openings, and one opening under between the branches.  the bottom foot has only one branch open with an oval mouth cave going in the hollow of that foot and continuing through to the top.  all openings are at least 1.5" across and may be used to insert an air-stone or LED light to further enhance it's display potential.  careful when removing this item from your tank to shake it around in your water and to take an inventory of your fish as it's easy for them to still be hiding inside this ornament.  the surface texture is pitted enough so you can tied Taxiphyllum to the surface, and over time as it grows, will stay attached on it's own.  Anubias will also root nicely over the indentations along the thicker branches of this item 
 Who knew that she is where the expression "She who must be obeyed" came from.  What a story and still worth a read 
 I am a teenaged ballet student.  I LOVED THIS BOOK.  It helped me in my study of ballet in so many ways:  understanding, balancing, executing movements, creating the illusions, improving my technique, and on and on.  I love how the book is written, because it is easy to understand even if you are not a Physicist (but it also has Scientific material and some pages with the math and physics illustrated in equations, etc., as well).  The chapters engage you with a question or puzzle that you have to solve.  This makes you want to hurry up to get to the end of each chapter to see if your guesses were correct.  You will learn how to create the illusion of floating in your grand jetes.  You will learn how dancers suspend their movement that receives a 'gasp' from the audience that happens whenever something is held beyond what seems possible or expected. It is a book I needed in order to get beyond my limits as a dancer.   
 ...and I completely enjoyed it.   So much, in fact, that as soon as I finished it, I ran out to the store to buy another Gerritsen novel. Unfortunately, the store only had Vanish, so I bought something else. Next time, I'll be sure to look for some of the earlier books. I'm hooked!  Definitely a page turner and well worth reading 
 The Wacom Pen should be one of the wonders of the world. After all, haven't you wondered how a battery-free pen can write onto a tablet, and even use two customizable buttons? This pen is very intuitive. When used with a Wacom Graphire4 Tablet, you get the best tool for creating at 
 Poor Romeo.   Watching Romeo meander his way through the play is like tailgating a drunk driver. At any moment he could crash, and in the end he overcorrects his assumptions by swallowing the poison, and in some ways his death must be a relief to his troubled mind.    Romeo's status in the story changes with nearly every scene, whether by his own doing or by an external entity.  However, his circumstance reflects in almost every case his willingness to succumb to his passions. From his love of Rosalind to his love for Juliet to his exile, he is a bundle of nerves. Taking a time out would slow the pace, and instead Shakespeare quickens it by transplanting Romeo's moment of joy with Juliet with a moment of action and consequence: the death of Mercutio.    Giving Romeo the chance to be happy might damage his character.  A great tragedy yet today.  What makes it great is that the basic storyline pulls everyone in, and once the story captures, we can start to appreciate the minor characters, like Capulet and the Nurse.       
 I have recently been on something of a Bill Bryson binge.  After having read The Mother Tongue and Short History of Nearly Everything, which are two of his more scholarly-oriented books, I decided to try this book (perhaps it should be noted that I have yet to read A Walk in the Woods; this title just appealed to me more).  The stories are often clever, and despite his complaining Bryson rarely, if ever, leaves the threshold of good intentions.  You have to realize that he is a reasonable man, and some of these irrational rants are merely for entertainment's sake and should not be analyzed too closely. That said, I agree with the editorial review in that sometimes he enters Dave Barry-like hyperbole, something that I personally find cheap and overdone, although Dave Barry sells lots of books, so many people must think that style is funny.  Personally, the more subtle humor, such as the little pet names for his wife he inserts in what are supposedly transcripts of actual conversations with her, that amuses me, as well as his joyful musings on American life.  Sure, this isn't too profound, but it manages to be intelligent and critical, while maintaining a whimsical air.  I can just picture ol' Bill with a content smirk on his face while writing these articles in his house in Hanover.  To sum it all up, Bill Bryson seems like the kind of guy I would love to have over for dinner, assuming he is as entertaining in person as he is in this book 
 I just finished watching Stalker for the fourth time over a period of three years, and I am now just a little bit closer to that sense that I "know" the film, but at the same time realize I will never understand it in all of its complexity. But I will certainly always appreciate and embrace it for the great achievement that it is. Stalker is unquestionably one of my favorite films of all time, and it's its mystery, its slowness, and intellect that make it such. Tarkovsky was truly a genius, not only evident by this film, but also by the many others he directed, including Nostalghia and Solaris.   There is so much in this film. It's about Christianity, Existentialism, Spiritualism, and Annihilism. It's a bone to the destitute and a slap in the face to the greedy. It's a challenge to examine and continuously reexamine one's existence.   "And if there wasn't any grief, our lives wouldn't be better, they'd be worse. Because then there'd be no happiness either. And no hope."   This is not the easiest film to watch because it moves very, very slowly. The pace is the total antithesis to current American filmmaking. At its best, it's hypnotic, and pausing the film several times to reengage might be necessary. But the journey, paralleling the one to the Zone, is ultimately well worth it. Highly recommended. 
 Mr Minasi has done it again with his Mastering Windows 2000 Server. As with the NT version it really is the only source you need to wade through the miriad of tasks required to effectively manage a Windows network 
 This book is about an Englishmen Phileas Fogg who had a bet with whist partners. He did so not because he needed the money, but because he solely wanted to win. Fogg traveled with his loyal servant Passepartout. They were secretly followed by Detective Fix who thought Fogg was the bank robber since he left England with a great amount of money. Fix believed that Fogg's abrupt leaving was the pretext of avoiding to be arrested, and he trusted his stubborn belief no matter what Passepartout told him. Because of him, Fogg was on the verge of losing his wager for many times when e tried his bet to detain him on the British territories so the arrest warrant would be valid. On the journey, Fogg rescued Aouda, an Indian princess, from the savages who practiced human sacrifice and told her she would remain unscratched wherever they went. After meeting Aouda, Fogg's whole life changed. And eventually, happiness and love were the new words added to his vocabulary.  This book gets more interesting as I read along, and it is also unpredictable because you never know what is going to happen next. For people who like adventure stories, "Around the World in 80 Days" is definitely one of the best choices.  
 This book focuses on frontend matters of web design and development: markup, style sheets, image production, multimedia, and so on. Ironically, despite its title, there is little in the way of "design" advice, per se. Rather, it strives to be a thorough reference for the technical details and requirements faced in day-to-day work designing and developing web content. Although it is a good introduction to all subjects covered, if you really want to dig into the details of any particular technology, you will probably need other reference books. As far as "big picture" instruction, though, I highly recommend it. I review the book further in the context of its table of contents.  The book is divided into six parts plus appendixes, each covering a general subject area.  Part I: The Web Environment Chapter 1, Web Standards, describes the current approach to web design and sets the stage for the entire book. It is essential reading. Chapters on designing for varying browsers and displays provide useful overviews of the unique challenges web developers face. Chapter 5, Accessibility, and Chapter 6, Internationalization, both serve as introductions to the ways web content may be created to reach all users, regardless of ability, browsing device, or language. Chapter 4, A Beginner's Guide to the Server, is a primer on basic server functions, system commands, uploading files, and file types.  Part II: The Structural Layer: XML and (X)HTML This part of the book is about document markup, commonly referred to as the structural layer because it provides the foundation upon which presentation (styles) and behaviors (scripting) are applied. Chapter 7, Introduction to XML, covers critical concepts that guide the way (X)HTML is handled in contemporary web design. Chapters 8 through 15 focus on HTML and XHTML markup, including detailed descriptions of all the elements and the way they should be used in standards-based web design.  Part III: The Presentation Layer: Cascading Style Sheets Part III provides a thorough guide to using CSS for controlling the presentation of web content with a focus on visual media. It begins with an overview of the fundamentals in Chapter 16 and continues on with an introduction to CSS selectors in Chapter 17. Chapters 18 through 23 provide detailed descriptions of all the visual properties in the CSS 2.1 specification. Finally, examples of how CSS is used in the real world are provided in CSS Techniques (Chapter 24) and Managing Browser Bugs: Workarounds, Hacks, and Filters (Chapter 25).  Part IV: The Behavioral Layer: JavaScript and the DOM Part IV is all about adding interactivity to your pages with JavaScript. Chapter 26 is an introduction to JavaScript, and covers syntax, control structures, object-orientation, and the whys and hows of unobtrusive scripting. Chapter 27 introduces the Document Object Model and shows how to tap into it to manipulate both content and design. As a supplement to Chapter 27,a brief introduction to Ajax techniques is included that will help you on your way to building richer Internet applications.  Part V: Web Graphics The chapters in Part V contain essential information on working with RGB color and choosing the appropriate graphic file formats. The chapters dedicated to GIF, JPEG, and PNG graphics offer practical tips for graphic production and optimization based on the compression schemes used by each format. The Animated GIFs chapter is a further examination of GIF's animation capabilities.  Part VI: Media Because the Web is not limited to text and images, Part VI is included to provide a basic introduction to adding audio, video, and Flash movies to web pages. There is also a chapter on printing from web pages using print-specific CSS style sheets as well as an introduction to the PDF format for document distribution.  Appendixes The Appendixes in this book are very useful. Appendix A is an alphabetical listing of all elements and attributes in the HTML 4.01 Recommendation, as well as a few nonstandard elements that are well supported and in common use. Appendix B is an alphabetical listing of all properties defined in the CSS 2.1 specification. Appendix C lists all the character entities defined in HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 with their numerical references. Appendix D provides a detailed explanation of the color names and RGB color values used both in (X)HTML and CSS. Finally, Appendix E describes the future of XHTML and Microformats 
 I thought that this cd set has some cool songs on it, but I mainly liked disc 1 most. Disc 2 just has a lot of songs I turned out not to like by chance. I do like 2 songs on disc 2, but if the songs on disc 1 were the only songs that came with the cd, Id be very satisfied. Being able to preview cds is awesome, but sometimes the 30 seconds you preview of the song is the worst part of the song and doesnt help you at all. When in doubt, buy used 
 Don't have time to exercise? The last of the good excuses is gone with this guide to 15-minute, no-sweat workouts presenting 10 minutes of aerobic activity, 4 minutes of strengthening exercises, and 1 minute of stretches. Step-by-step illustrations demonstrate just how to do them, case history successes link exercises to positive results, and the author comes with credentials: he's directed the Occupational Health and Fitness program at the U.S. DOT for the past twenty-five years, and presented extensive seminars to business and government groups alike. With Quick Fit: The Complete 15-Minute No-Sweat Workout, even those who are most pressed for time have no excuse now. 
 Sandburg was a poet, and this is a poetic biography of Lincoln. Is that an asset or a liability? In today's climate of "facts, facts, facts," most would probably say the latter. But, in this instance, I would disagree. There are occasions when great poets hit, with their prose, closer to the mark than the historians. It's like the story of the spirit of one of the Russian aristocrats, going through the history books and saying, "My secret is safe." Then, he reads Tolstoy's War and Peace and shakes his ghostly fist, crying, "How did he know?" This is a great work by a great writer. If you are looking for more than a biography of Lincoln, if you are looking to be transported, this is the book for you. 
 Generalissimo El Busho: Essays & Cartoons on the Bush Years by Ted Rall is a scathing, funny, and poignant collection on the George W. Bush Presidency.  Starting out with the 2000 election and exploring topics like 9/11, the Iraq War etc., Rall presents some legitimate, tough, and in some cases eye opening criticism on W. and his administration.  I was specifically entertained endlessly by his cartoons of "el presidente".  They are crude drawings, but delibertly so.  They are so funny and the criticism is so dead on I would recommend it to anyone who has legitimate questions about this administration.  The facts are Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, there was no link between Iraq and Al-Queda, and we were mislead into a war that has distracted from what should be the real focus fighting Al-Queda and terrorism and finding the "evil-doer" Osama Bin-Laden.  Rall presents the mistakes of W. in a fun and entertaining fashion.  A must read! 
 This book is full of information, although the pages are so paper thin, forget about highlighting anything!  I found the way the information is presented on the dry side. Facts are listed in an a,b,c, etc. format. By  the time I get to h or I, I already forgot what they were trying to  explain 
 This is a very well researched book.  The author has taken great pains to measure and analyze Vermeer's paintings, finding a striking feature that many of them, when back-projected through the perspective view point at the size of the painting, imply a consistent location of a back wall to the common room used in the pictures.  The author asserts that the only reasonable explanation for this coincidence is that Vermeer used a camera obscura for at least some of the layout of his paintings.  This comes off as very plausible, though the analysis is limited to paintings that include a tiled floor.  It would have been interesting to see this work extended through photogrammetry of objects of known sizes in the paintings (chairs, musical instruments, etc) and applied to more of the paintings.  I think the only real failing in the argument is that Vermeer could have could have had the skill to paint perspective of this quality, and therefore not needed the aid of a camera.  As pointed out in the text, he was not bound to perfect accuracy; there are some deviations 
 Dinu Lipatti was one of several tragic musical geniuses from the post-World War II period who died far too young. (Others included the pianist William Kapell, the contralto Kathleen Ferrier and the violinist Ginette Neveu.) Lipatti died at about the same age as Mozart and Schubert, and his recordings of those composers on this disc demonstrate that his loss was almost as great a catastrophe for the art of music as theirs. Lipatti's pianism "flowed like oil," to borrow one of Mozart's favorite phrases; it was always elegant but never mannered, always reasonable but never dull, intensely spiritual but never in a grandstanding way. I remember reading an interview with Seiji Ozawa in which he said that Lipatti's recording of "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" was the only disc he would recommend to anyone who wanted to get acquainted with classical music; it was so beautiful and so warmly human, Ozawa said, that anyone who heard it would be hooked forever. Ozawa was absolutely right, and that recording is on this disc. Buy it 
 I use this book both for interviewing techniques and for preparing to be interviewed.  Its a great book for interviewing because he presents the pros and cons of different techniques and gives what I consider to be a good framework for identifying quality candidates.  Its a great book for preparing to be interviewed because it helps you identify the objectives of interviewers and make a better case.  As a hiring manager, you should be able to pass an interview with flying colors, shouldn't you?  Perhaps the most enlightening wisdom I got from the book was the enumeration of the qualities of a good employee:  1.  Ability to do the job 2.  Willingness to do the job 3.  Manageability of the candidate  Most interviews focus on the abilities of the candidates and stop there.  Big mistake!  Mr. Yate gives you guidance on evaluating the whole candidate, and in general I like and agree with his advice.  Other good ideas are evaluating the cracks in resumes, phone screening, and lunch.  Never hire anyone without checking background, verifying employment and education, and seeing if they can carry on a conversation at lunch.  I draw ideas for interviews from several books, but this one is the overall framework that I have worked from.  I feel the style is readable, the length is appropriate, and the content is excellent 
 This is a classic Russian comedy I saw for the first time when I was in Moscow almost 10 years ago.  The DVD doesn't have a lot of special features, but it is in the original Russian and offers both Russian and English subtitles, so anyone can view it.  This is just as funny now as it was the first time I saw it and includes a classic scene where Shurik's roomate is trying to cheat on a test.  Unlike most Russian humor, you don't need to be from Moscow to enjoy it 
 These fresh Vine-Ripe Tomatoes are perfect for the next time you go to your local pillory or to simply throw at your village idiot.  They taste pretty good too 
 This is without a doubt the best cookbook I have read. Few cookbooks out there are as readable and interesting as this one and even fewer can come close in terms of the photography. This is as much a look into the food anthropology of the region as it is a cookbook. I lived in Chicago when I got this book and then moved to Hawaii, so for the most part I have had minimal challenges in rounding up authentic asian ingredients. Unless you live in a large city this could be a challenge, but the results from the easy-to-follow recipes speak for themselves. This cookbook is a confidence builder - because these are for the most part home-style recipes, they are somewhat forgiving and the exotic smells that fill your kitchen will impress your guests long before the flavorful, aromatic and colorful dishes are brought to table. Anyone who enjoys the aromas of Asian Food in general and foods of Thailand, Laos, Vietnam (among others) in specific will love this cookbook for it's clarity, simplicity, and authenticity. Anyone who has visited or spent time in this region will love it for it's photography and storytelling. This book is a winner as a cookbook and as a love letter to the people and places it describes 
 You'd think that recording quality would not be an issue with these "background" CDs, but some are terrible.  In contrast, this one was  well-engineered 
    After Main Course, the Bee Gees started to write more songs that were into rock and roll, and disco.  Songs that are featured in this album are You Should Be Dancing (#1), Love So Right (#6), Love Me (#7), Boogie Child (#13), and Children of the World (#24).  In comparison to Main Course, this album is better, but if you compare it to the Spirits Having Flown, its a little too weak. The reason I suggest that is because the Bee Gees had gained more confidence in writing after the Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack, but they are stronger than Main course, since Main Course was a switch for them. Great album. Nice painting at the front 
 An insightful look into a life, with lots of universal truths to be had.  While some of the essays threatened to lapse into tedium from time to time, they were all ultimately rescued with honest insights into life.   Especially poignant were the chapters on the death of the author's father and on failure.  There was much in these essays that spoke to me.  I'd recommend this book to a friend 
 Reading these stories, set in North Africa where Bowles lived, is like  like roaming some lonely alien landscape while being helplessly asaulted by  feelings of dread, wonder, strangeness, and beauty. Lacking much  descriptive prose,these stories are naked, simple, raw. Gradualy the self  dissolves, the character's behaivor is so defined by their enviroment that  they become part of it . The reader, too, melts into the background. East  and west colide violently, explode ; and nothing remains but the stark  terror and magic of life. Own of Bowles best. A must forWilliam Burroughs  fans too 
 I finally finished this excellent book! I have been working through it for the better part of a month and a half! It is quite a book.  Greg Boyd makes a very compelling case for a "warfare worldview". The first half of the book argues from the Old Testament seeking to demonstrate a warfare worldview is the primary worldview represented in the Old Testament.  The second half of the book examines the New Testament and its foundations in a warfare worldview.  It is a powerful new way of thinking in my opinion. Obviously to hold to this worldview is to be a minority in current evangelical and protestant circles. But after reading this book I must say that I am comfortable and intellectually encouraged to move this way.  One of the most convincing features is the warfare worldview's handling of the problem of evil.  The traditional view is that God is in control of everything. Sovereignty is understood as omnicontrol. Therefore the question "why does an all-powerful, all good God allow bad things to happen" is legitimate. Boyd argues that the Bible does not conceive of God's sovereignty in the sense of omnicontrol. Because of this, God's will can and reddily is thwarted by spirits and humans who have freewill. Thus, when these beings chose to disobey God, they enter into warfare against their Creature.  If you're at all interested in a very stimulating and thoroughly biblical book (meaning, Boyd is constantly engaged in biblical exegesis throughout) dealing with theodicy and spiritual warfare, pick up this book. But don't plan to try to read it in a week like I did! This is a book that you will need to live with for awhile 
 This was one of the most lovely books compiled by Christopher Tolkien concerning his father.  J.R.R. Tolkien's correspondances are witty, charming, and illuminating concerning his life and his work.  I recommend this book for any Tolkien fan and believe that no Tolkien collection is complete without it 
 I recently read Ilyce Glink's "10 Steps to Home-Ownership" and came away impressed.  She has great worksheets, and an objective, no-nonsense approach to the home ownership process.   I recently closed on a home in the Southern California area and used "10 Steps" to prepare me for the process.     I found myself referring to Eric Tyson's "Home Buying for Dummies" more than this book once I activeley looked for a home.  However, I felt "10 Steps" was a good starter for the process and the worksheets made me comfortable with what I wanted and how much I can afford. One small complaint: she includes 70 pages of interest rate amortization tables which could be easily translated on one page 
 This is a useful textbook. It is easy to read, informative, and well organized 
 I am diabetic and I have been losing about 10 lbs per month for 6 months eating these bars as a between meal source of protein.  They satisfy my taste for something sweet and are filling. 
 I could read this book over and over and over 
 This book does a good job of putting music in an overall historical context.  For example, it notes how Baroque productions, whether sculpture or music, meant to "fill space."  That accounts for elaborate melodies in music, and movement in painting and sculpture.   Music used to be written as much for the mind as the ear.  In some vocal pieces, lyrics correspond to melody.  For example, if the word "ascending" is used in the song, the notes of the melody also go up.  Vice-versa for descending.  If the song mentions one person, a single voice is used--three voices come in when three people are in the storyline.  The musical selections are varied and enjoyable to listen to 
 Antony was the only one I loved--okay Rufus was fine too-- in that horrible documentary on Leonard Cohen. So I went out and got this album. You really can play leave this CD in your machine and play it over and over and over 
 This blew me away.  The Series is excellent.  It really brought home what we are truly fighting 
 In a nutshell, DeMeo says that before around 4000 BCE, humans were democratic, egalitarian, sex-positive, pleasure-oriented, non-violent Goddess-worshiping "matrists."  Over the next 10-20 generations, however, certain matrist groups morphed into "patrists": violent, sexually-repressive, misogynistic, sadistic, male-dominated high-god worshipers with painful and traumatic child rearing techniques.    What caused the morphing?  More on that below.  First, though, a word on  DeMeo's research.  This is not any old "armchair science" book.  DeMeo backs up his theories - ten years in the making -- with some of the most solid and extensive interdisciplinary data I've ever seen.  To present this data for our perusal took over 400 pages, in a large-scale format, of scores of maps, charts, diagrams, figures, tables, drawings, photographs, footnotes and appendices as well as ample data-driven text.    The majority of DeMeo's data are sterling.  For example, working with class-A anthropological data (from the Human Relations Area Files, etc.) and meshing those with class-A geological data (from the Budyko-Lettau Dryness Ratio), DeMeo shows that (1) around 4000 BCE a broad ribbon of land across Africa, the Middle East and Asia began dying;  2) People living in this land became the most patriarchal on the planet; and, 3) the further one wanders from this ribbon of land, the less patriarchal people are.   DeMeo calls this land "Saharasia."  It's an area that covers hundreds of thousands of square miles on our planet.    DeMeo offers a fascinating analysis of how the hideous change from matrist to patrist occurred.  He bases his arguments on current studies of starving peoples.  The behavioral changes in starving groups are enormous and appalling.  Starving people become consumed with eating and lose interest in all other pleasures, including sex.  The old and young are abandoned to die.  Brothers steal food from sisters, and in some cases parents eat their own children.  For children who survive, bad diet leads to laundry lists of psychological and physical abnormalities down the road.  The culture breaks down.  Life bumps into chaos.    Although this starvation syndrome began in Saharasia ca 4000 BCE, it continued for generation after generation.  Most of the crazed groups caught in the desertification process died out.  In the few that survived (and why they survived is explained below), mentally-ill behaviors became institutionalized.  Mental illness became their way of life; the loss of interest in pleasure; the glorification of the strong; the strong stealing from the weak - all these and more would have become fossilized into a new and actively promoted way of life - a set of behaviors "learned, shared, patterned and transmitted from generation to generation," as my anthropology texts used to define culture.  It is at this point, when mental-illness becomes codified, that one witnesses the birth of the patriarchy.    DeMeo contends that the first response to desertification was for the agricultural matrists to abandon their land and become nomadic, riding horseback over rough terrain, frantically searching for food and water.  In order to keep babies alive, loving matrist mothers would bind (swaddle) them tightly in cloth.  Babies spent all day tied to their mother's backs, unable to move heads, hands, legs or feet.  For the successful new patrist groups this swaddling became something glorified.  One effect was severe skull deformation in both infants and adults.    DeMeo thinks that infant swaddling and head binding produces a deep-set rage in adults, especially toward mothers, women, and female deity.  Hence one possible source of the misogyny and abandonment of female deity that became hallmarks of patriarchal cultures.    "The heads of ... children ... are pressed so tightly by means of a peculiar kind of ligature, that little by little the heads assume the shape of sugar-loaves.  The pressure is so great that the noses of the children ... are constantly bleeding....  The child cries and turns black, and when the mother presses on its forehead, a white slimy fluid comes out its nose and ears...." (p. 112).    Fortunately, skull deformation has died out over the past several hundred years (p. 112).  Swaddling, however, has not.  Even today groups across, and on the edges of Saharasia retain this awful practice in, for example, the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China.    Although I don't agree with every theory in his book, I think DeMeo's basic premise - that ancient, widespread, continental desertification drove humans from their natural, healthy state into one of codified mental illness -- is a premise he proves almost beyond a shadow of a doubt.    And knowing that, once upon a time we actually *did* live in "The Garden of Eden," means there's hope we can get back there again.    
  Iin terms of speed and functionality, the program Mathematica is the most amazing program I have ever used. It is an indispensable tool for research in many areas of the sciences and mathematics. From the evaluation of mathematical formulas to the graphing of three-dimensional data over time, it can handle almost anything that you need to process or analyze. Surprisingly user-friendly for such a capable program, it takes very little time for even a novice to put it to productive use. However, with all that capability there is a problem with the sheer number and detail of the options, which is why the documentation is so critical. While there is extensive online documentation with Mathematica that is easy to use, there is still a need for the documentation in physical form.   This book, in its fourth edition, is complete, and easy to use, with the exception of requiring a bit of physical effort to lift. That's correct - the book contains 1,470 pages. In my extensive use of Mathematica, I use the book and online help in about equal amounts. Generally, I use the online help when I don't remember a precise syntax and I'll use the book when I'm concerned more with the details of the behavior or the nuances of an operation or a capability.   I consider this reference book essential to the efficient use of Mathematica and well its procurement, if the software package you have does not contain a copy. This fourth edition contains excellent tutorials, a myriad of examples, and a wonderful gallery of graphic images.  Published in Mathematics and Computer Education, reprinted with permission 
 Product in good condition. There are few films I enjoy, this is one of them.  Not on my best ever list, but enjoyable 
 If you love history and love to laugh, get this book today. It's a good idea to order it over Amazon, too, since in the bookstore you may find yourself leafing through it and laughing too hard to muster the composure to take it to the cash register. That was my experience, anyway.   The book works as a serviceable social and political history of the 20th century that manages to be to be laugh-out-loud-funny on every page. The headlines are hilarious, and the accompanying stories play the joke out to perfection, sprinkling in endless references and allusions. If it happened in the 20th century and mattered to anyone, the Onion has found a way to satirize it in these pages -- whether you thought it deserved it or not.  Our Dumb Century's combination of historical acumen and humorous insight is worthy of Mark Twain 
 This is simply the best.  As it is combined with the seminar you give, "Courageous Moms Raising Boys to Become Good Men", this will be a world changer!  I am so glad to have heard about you and your work.  Thank you for the easy to read, deeply insightful book. You have given many woman hope whither they are single, married, grandma's or teachers, the insight and wisdom is refreshing!  I'll be looking forward to reading your next book 
 This is a must read, no matter what level a practitioner  is at- student, beginner, or, like me, in the field for  over a dozen years. A wonderfully, sensitively written  book about relationship dynamics in touch therapies, from someone who truly has walked the path we are all going to walk if we are involved in touch therapies, manual therapies, bodywork,  massage. I was fortunate to have some of this type of  training , in a very good way, when in schools, but I know  very well that it is rare, and getting more rare for schools  to provide these important insights. I know this because I teach the graduates of those schools, and sometimes receive work from those graduates. This, to me, is much more important than simply reading about "ethics", because a deeper understanding of relationship dynamics truly helps us form and understand our ethics in the first place. This is must-have insight for all schools to delve into,and provide ample training in- including the medical profession! If your work involves touch in a therapeutic way, read this book!  5 stars for this contribution to the field! 
 This book is an astute analysis of the film business by someone outside the motion picture business. Many books are written about the movie business by insiders or entertainment reporters but often these writers are too close to the subject or in awe of the subject and as a result miss the mark. Mr. Epstien gives an astute analysis of the current state of the business using sources that normally are not available to the public.  An example is the confidential disclosures by the six major studios to the Motion Picture Association Of America (MPAA), which are then compiled into an industry compendium disclosing studios sources of revenue. Mr. Epstein confines his analysis to the six major studios, Disney, Sony, Universal, Warners, Paramount and Fox, which dominate the motion picture and ancillary entertainment businesses world wide.  Once a movie's theatrical release was the primary source of a studios income and indeed in the beginning the only income.  Now however the theatrical release is just the beginning of income to the studios that now earn more income from video/DVD sales and rentals than the initial theatrical release. Also particular types of movies that lend themselves to action figures, promotional tie-ins, theme park rides and sequels are the major earners for the studios. Examples of these are Star Wars, Jurassic Park and Batman. These movies are easy to understand, involve multiple spectacular action scenes and cater to a young demographic who go to movies, buy the action figures and memorabilia associated with a movie and after seeing it more than once in the theatres may buy the DVD or video of the movie.   While the cost of making and advertising the theatrical release may exceed box office receipts the picture will make money for the studio over the years in rentals, sales of the movie, leasing to television, pay per view, income from licensing toys and other products associated with the movie.  Mr. Epstein has described the historical development of the studios from creators of films shown in wholly owned theatrical chains to vast clearing houses greenlighting and financing producers to distributing, selling, licensing movies and related products world wide.   This book was a profound look at the business side of the entertainment business and the people who control and profit from it. Ever wonder why there is such a paucity of quality entertainment for persons older than twenty-five? Because in order to have a mega blockbuster that generates billions of dollars in income over the years it must be geared toward the 12 to 24 year old audience, with a story line that can be easily understood even it all the audience doesn't speak the language of the movie well. This means action movies with a simplistic story line of good triumphing over evil.  This was an excellent book and after reading it you will understand why the major studios no longer care about making quality-sophisticated entertainment. Edsopinion.co 
 this product is workin darn good for me. ya so what a couple things fall out of place you people act like your kids toy box stays organized. there are only 12 pieces in there its not that hard to sort through and put them back in their respective slots. and the handle issue.........grab it by the bottom....ur an adult you dont need a lunch pale anymore.....and the person crying about it not staying securely latched get creative and shove a little tape behind the clip...it will stay extended and lock in place....good product........good price......what more can you ask for. 
 I really like her skirt with all the patterns and her sandals are pretty. Also her hair style is so cute and it doesn`t take that long to put her trousers on like it does to put on teen Yasmin`s trousers. 
 The movies, from Tora, Tora, Tora; to the Battle of Britain; to Twelve O'Clock High pretty well tell the story. All kinds of fancy airplanes have been designed and built to get a gun pointed at the enemy.   World War II was fought with a set of airplanes that fit into a very small segment of time. The last biplanes were built about 1940, and the first jets about 1944. But World War II was fought (largely) with piston engined monoplanes armed with machine guns.   The British studies showed that they were primarily fighting unarmored aircraft that would be best attacked with rifle caliber machine gune. The Americans were in love with their .50 caliber machine guns. The Germans, faced with the problem of shooting down the heavily armed American bombers favored heavier cannon that could fire explosive shells.   This is the story of the guns used by the air forces fighting World War II. It includes the technical aspects as well as some of the theory, or perhaps politics is a better word, behind the thinking of the various air forces.   A unique work for the weapons affectionado. 
 This is one you won't put down...I've slogged through quite a few wwii personal memoirs...this one is a winner, buy it.. 
 I really enjoyed this book.  I was intrigued by Shayne Lee's positive review in a religion journal and so I decided to read it and wasn't disappointed.  I could relate to many of her findings and she quite perceptively discussed how women in the church are at times oblivious to Womanist literature and how sexism is so pervasive in the black church.  Although I don't live in the South, I really think she tapped into my experience with her nice discussions about the daily issues Christian women face.  Thanks for such a thoughtful look at both positive and negative experiences of women in the black church.   
 I burned through this book in a weekend, so curious to know what was in store for me as a newly diagnosed person. I found it to be comforting (which I needed at the time), but light in some of the issues I have subsequently faced (such as unsympathetic employers, inability to pay for injection medicines). I'd like to see a book on the challenges of everyday life for newly diagnosed...I think I could have benefitted from someone else's experinces 
 This is the best information I've found on Celiac. Although the info I found on-line was very helpful, some of it was wrong. Thanks to Dr. Green, I now have access to answer the many questions I had and will have 
 The good: The advice here from successful weight-losers is wide-ranging, generally useful, and presented in context so that you know something about the person's weight history and particular circumstances. Not all of it is going to be useful for any particular person, of course, but the perspective of successful people is, as another reviewer remarked, like gold.  The bad: About half the book (scattered throughout plus a section at the back) consists of the author's own weight-loss advice and diet program. This is very much oriented toward fat-as-dietary-demon. If you're using a high-protein/low carbohydrate approach, this part obviously won't be applicable for you; if you're following a conventional low-fat/limited-protein/high-carbohydrate diet, you'll find it more useful. HOWEVER...  The ugly: Be careful about the particulars of the diet advice here. The book advises use of margarine instead of butter in the meal plans, which was conventional thinking in 1994 (when the first edition was published) but is inexcusable in a book published in 2003. The author recommends using sweet snacks such as jelly beans, licorice, marshmallows, etc., and says "Sugar and low-fat sweets per se don't concern me too much as a dietician" so long as they don't contain fat. Sugar candy may have zero fat but that doesn't make it a good thing to encourage  people to snack on. A dietician writing in 2003 should know better.  Summary: by all means read the book, but get it for the stories of the "masters", not the diet advice. Just about all of the "masters" had at least one thing to say that I found useful and insightful 
 A hugely important work, immense in its scope.  This book is an excellent educational experience, on at least the levels of racial attitudes in the 60's and beyond, Boston and New England history, local and national  politics, and social stratification.  Common ground is detailed in its  factual accounts, empathic with its central characters, and insightful yet  unbiased.  A must-read for anyone from the Northeast, and a should-read for  everyone else.  I hope to read this at least every other year, so as not to  forget its importance and cultural significance 
 This is a truly funny movie. The main character is so out of her element that it is totally belivable how ridiculous she is. This is one of those movies that you buy and come back to watch and invite your friends over for movie night. It's a good buy for your DVD collectio 
 I received this book as a present, and I am very pleasantly surprised by this book. This book contains modern and creative twists on traditional American dishes as well as other food of ethnic origin making its way into mainstream. All the dishes I've made from it have turned out to be very delicious, the steps are simple to follow, and most of the ingredients are available at well-stocked supermakets. I was surprised how many things I used to have to buy can be made so easy with so little time or effort. This was what I had hoped my Moosewood cookbook would be, but this book actually succeeds because of it is more focused, placing emphasis on beauty through simplicity rather than purely just inventiveness.  Another part I really like about this book is that it actually contain a decent breakfast section. From now on I no longer have to rely on omlettes or toast for breakfast, but instead I can have banana french toast, different muffins, etc.  The recipes here are very straightforward, so they are suitable for most levels of cooks. The only possible drawback is that there are no pictures (though you won't need them), and there are no directions on preparation techniques, so I would suggest this book for those with at least some rudimentary kitchen skills. 
 This is abook you will read until you are finished! It is a true story, an ongoing look at starting a farm, raising sheep, putting up fence, and all of the fun that goes with it. My family thought I was nuts, because I would start laughing out loud! Very good humor, very entertaining! I have given many copies for gifts! 
 i loved this book.its sending a message to teens that your real friends will stick with you know mater how fat or skinney you are.In this book a perfect,popular junior gets a disease were she gains and gains weight no matter how hard she works out or how much she stops eating.she finds out that her real friends will stick ith her no matter what happen 
 This movie is another reason why Mr. Williams is a great actor. Nice love story, death story and an inspiring ending. A must have or at least see for all. 
 Rita Bornstein's book should be required reading for all actual and would-be college administrators - but why stop there?  Anyone interested in the legitimate use of power in a leadership position can benefit from reading this. She offers a thoughtful, honest clarity as she makes her points, using the story of her own presidency of Rollins College as a guidepost.  Really good 
 I just got this movie today and thought it was cute, funny, and short. Im really not to fond of american animation only for a few shows. This is a good movie if you like Strawberrys or thornberrys lol. Stu gets everyone trapped on a island in the middle of the ocean and Anglecia and Debbie meet each other. Thats the scary part. The funniest part is when Chralet jumps into the ocean to get to the cruise ship that was just funny. A must have if you like thornberrys 
 This erotic drama is a keeper.  It definitely appeals to the senses.  Hot steaming chinese baths, firecrackers.  Passion, passion, passion all around.  You will love it.  Never thought acupunture could look so exhilirating.  Billy Zane -- whoo, baby! Wonderfully sexy film 
 Bought this to take to the beach and with us on vacation for hotel rooms etc. Used recently on a trip to Miami Beach and it works like a charm. Convenient - stores your IPOD securely while en route to wherever and so easy to throw in a beach bag. We use it now at home out by the jacuzzi and on the patio so we can easily change songs without using the main receiver in the house. The sound is very good for such a small unit - obviously your not going to get great bass from such small speakers but for what it is - this is a great device for a great price. Very happy with it 
 One of the most excitant books 	 On the "Downriver" you will be accompanied to our protagonists to a world of excitants and dangerous adventures. On this book you will also found a good message specialty for younger readers. Which in summary the author "Will Hobbs" tell you how difficult the life is with out parents' advice or adult experience. I truly recommend this book. It is excellent, you'll don't waste your time!     	  
 Ann Leary flew to London for what she thought would be a short vacation, when she unexpectedly delivered her baby prematurely. She uses humor and story telling skills to recount her subsequent five month stay in England, as her baby is born and then slowly grows. This book is a bit lighter than many books on prematurity, focusing on her fish out of water feelings as she copes with living on low funds in an unfamiliar environment. The author is frank and open about her struggles with the complications of having a preemie, in the special care unit and then in her apartment. This is a book that anyone can enjoy, as well as parents of preemies 
 Literally dozens of books about boards have come out in the past few years. This one stands out from the crowd because it's written by a seasoned and successful nonprofit executive with a pragmatic and reality-based approach to governance. If you're a nonprofit executive, this book acknowledges the limitations and frustrations of nonprofit governance, then gives concrete suggestions for turning your board into a high-impact team. If you serve on a nonprofit board, you'll be informed and inspired by the author's concept of strategic governance. The Strategic Board should be in every nonprofit executive's briefcase 
 I ordered this card to put in my mother's computer. She needed a basic card for listening to online music and such - nothing fancy - and this fit the bill. Install was a snap and took perhaps 10 minutes. I encountered no problems with drivers on XP and she was back up and happily listening to music within 15 minutes. Perhaps not the card for a picky audiophile, but great as a no-frills, good quality card which delivers surprisingly good sound for such little money 
 This series has just a tad too much blood for my taste... it verges on horror, here and there, which bugs me; I even like super-violent action movies just fine, but the brutally slaughtered recent corpse thing (more 'personalized' violence than killing bad guys) is not my style. This is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  Aside from that detail, I find this show totally addictive. The brothers make a 'buddy movie' effect, and the whole supernatural framework creates a sort of non-religious yet definitely spiritual effect (the big mystery being why these guys never ever are seen praying in the show; I have actually known people who had a lifestyle similar to what the show depicts, and that is central).  Not to mention the young men being so passionate, powerful, strong, yet sensitive, darkly troubled from the past, sheer SEXY it's nearly intoxicating over the long run of many episodes. ;-)  Anyway -- the show has an actual plot, it's well filmed and intelligently done and is well worth watching. I recommend it 
 I really enjoed the first chapter on how the concept translated into the final product of a ride. Amazing how these things come together. The second chapter comparing the ride throughs between the four parks I found a bit frustrating - hard to really picture it unless you're there (for me). I was more interested in the ride portion than the movie chapter myself. Worth the buy (though I bought it used) 
 I chose this mystery from a limited selection with some hesitation, as I've read other mysteries in the past that turned out to be duds. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. There is intrigue, rivalry, romance, and I learned some interesting bits of information about the antiques business and some good affirmations from the late father of the at times histrionic protagonist.  
 What's with all the glooming reviews?  It's a christian fiction--as pointed out by the authors on the cover themselves.  When embarking upon a book, I looked to be entertained and this book clearly does it for me as well as it should for ANY reader.  So I defend the book's purpose.  I can't put it down and I'm only half way through it--enjoying it in fact.  Choose to believe what spiritual and religious facts and truths you would like.  However, if you are inspired to search the truth, then search the inspired Word of God, The Bible; and search to understand God for yourself.  Otherwise, take the other book-bashing reviews with a grain of salt and enjoy or be moved by the experience and journey through which the book takes you.    I do recommend reading the entire series as I am doing.  The series is not a hard read and you will flow through it very quickly.  If you're looking to be entertained, this is a series for you 
 Mead's book is an excellent reference manual on denominations in the United States.  Statistical information is included, along with the origins and beliefs of various religious groups.  Among the most helpful features were the list of headquarters of denominations, the glossary, and the list of helpful resources.  I definitely learned valuable information about denominations I knew little to nothing about 
 I didn't know what to expect when I started this book. A friend had recommended it. I picked up the book at eight in the evening. I didn't put it down until I was done. This is not a suspense book. But it's great literature. The story is very well written, the characters are 100% believable. I never played football in highschool, but I appreciate the conflict in the main character. This is a great story about a man coming of age, coming to terms with his failures and short comings. I thought this book was a great read and worth sharing. You don't have to like football to enjoy the characters of this book. 
 When I got this book, I needed a manual that described the effects of embalming techniques. This book is loaded with diagrams to guide the physician along the way. Please don't miss the chapter on the holistic  benefits of psycho-pyramidology 
 I never laughed so hard...especially about the Mehta's dog! This book was well written and actually very humorous! A must read 
 Dan's book is extremely informative. It is filled with information and guidelines for the author who chooses to self-publish. It is a MUST read. I highly recommend it.Very well written and easy to understand 
 A good book but not nearly as endearing as The Color Purple 
 David Herbert Donald truly does the work of the historian and allows the reader to come face to face with the real Lincoln.  The importance of the subject demands as much: the upbringing, temperament, private life, politics, pressures, shortcomings, and ideals of the man who headed the United States during the civil war and ended the institution of slavery.  Donald's biography captures all of this, but what I appreciated most was getting to see how Lincoln lived the conflict between some of America's greatest ideals and grimist realities in both what he was faced with and how he conducted himself as president 
 When the Ventures' back catalogue was reissued on CD in the 1990s, most combined two LPs on a single CD. "Telstar" and "In Space" were early 1960s hit LPs, recorded right around the time the Ventures won an endorsement deal with Mosrite guitars and adopted a tough, fuzzed-out sound. As a bonus, this CD has a useful and accurate booklet.  "Telstar" has more variety than "In Space," featuring a very aggressive version of "Green Onions," a faithful rendition of Herb Alpert's "The Lonely Bull" and the amazing title track with its Star Trek-like electric organ. "In Space" is a collection of sci-fi themed songs. Some are originals, some aren't; "He Never Came Back" is a fantastic original song in a "Monster Mash" vein. It's hard to believe, but the Ventures didn't use synthesizers on "Outer Limits," relying instead on steel guitars, reverb, electronic organs, creative mic placement, and tape manipulation. While nothing on this CD is surf music in the purest sense, the Ventures helped define surf music to such a degree that it's hard not to think of this as surf in the broadest possible sense.  While the Ventures' playing on all their LPs is always first-rate, special mention must be made here of Mel Taylor. He's something of a forgotten name among rock drummers, but in his day he was quite impressive - influencing (among others) Keith Moon of the Who. The Ventures are often mentioned as a band that budding rock guitarists should listen to, but I would go further and suggest that young rock drummers could learn quite a bit from Taylor's excellent style.  I highly recommend this CD 
 My wife first picked up this book and was giving me bits of info as she read it.  Well I got interested in the details so I read it after she completed it.   I would never have bought this book on my own but I must say that I really enjoyed it.   I think because there was so much news coverage that I really liked learning more of the details that did not always come out in the coverage.  My wife said that there was not too much new in this book, but for me there really was, as I have not followed the story as closely as my wife.   What you have here is all the facts put together in one book that is an easy to read review.   I would recommend it if you are interested in the topic 
 The pressure , the unbearable tension in the middle of the war takes its place when a unscrupulous Officer goes far beyond the duty and the rules chasing the triumph no matter how expensive can be the result , in terms of warlike resources and human beings .  A permanent lesson for all those who are really interested in management policies and  take of decisions .. Gable in one of his best portraits !  
 I enjoyed reading this book.  Al was definitley a loveable S.O.B..The man really built an empire in spite of all the critics that believed an National paper was a ridiculous idea.  He did it with style, grace, and charm.  The book also reminded me of an old saying "every failure plants a seed of an equivalent success.&quot 
 Barchester Towers is one of the most timeless British classics I have read. Told to us in narrative, this is a story of hierachy, power, love, and downfall, in this sacred, private, ecclesiastical world. Written with an intuitive perception for sights, sounds, and characters, there are no protagonists to whom you can sympathize, and yet each of these characters will leave you spellbound for there depth and sensitivity. The story is set in Barchester, a small divided city in the northern part of England. On one side of this division, and from where our story focuses, we have a wealthy church diocese, who with its own rules all must obey. Enter: Mr. Obadiah Slope. Single, sinister, and the new Dean of Barchester. From his very arrival he knew only of one thing, reform and change. And was met with scrutiny, and hostility, from a conclave where no secrets are shared or revealed. Poignantly written, the truths of this diocean world and its parshioners are slowly unveiled, as the author cleverly manoeuvres from chapter to chapter, giving us insight into conflicts among prominent families and the clergy. And it is these scenes of conflict among our characters: deceit, revenge, vanity, prosperity, and moral convictions, which are the most graphic, mesmerizing, and suspenseful, as any author could have written, and will leave you wanting more information as each page is turned. Written in an era when victorian men were considered strong parochial figures, and seduction among women sacrilege, the script is turned. And it is the women who dominate these pages, for there intelligence, independence, strength, and complexity. And ironically, it is the men who in my opinion, who are reduced to timid, naive, hypocrites. Though not to be deceived, male dominance does prevail, as passion wins over compassion, love for lust, and reverence for irreverence, as our author delivers a masterpiece of a finale in English literature, between two destined lovers. Barchester Towers is my introdution to Anthony Trollope, and will not be the last, that I plan to read in the future 
 I needed to replace a lost S4oo we had for about a year. Looked at the SD series and thought them too small for comfort. There is such a thing as too thin to handle comfortably. The S500 is, like the S400, just right in size. Big area on back for thumb so you an even one-hand hold it. Try that with any SD. Pictures are excellent for a hand-held. Not Nikon N70 film SLR good, but plenty good enough for any snapshot purpose. Bought one of last new S500's available at NewEgg abd very, very happy with it 
      Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass is an exemplary representation of both transcendentalism and realism.  Walt Whitman was one of the few writers to bridge the gap between these literary movements and Leaves of Grass was, in essence, his opus.  It represented the author himself and was often condemned in Whitman's time for it's blatant descriptions and incorporations of sexuality and homosexuality.  However, years later it came to be appreciated for what it is truly worth as an exquisite culmination of people, emotions, and the democratic spirit.      Of the many themes covered throughout the 438 pages in the ninth edition of Whitman's masterpiece, symbolism was often used to represent allegory ideas and situations.  In "O Captain! My Captain!" the captain symbolizes Abraham Lincoln and America is ship.  In the captain's death, Whitman is alluding to the fact that in the absence of strong leadership guiding the "ship," there will be a lack of order and chaos.  "Song of Myself" was, on the other hand, explicit in the ideal it depicted.  All fifty-two sections discuss intricacies of semi-specific people or types of people; they come together as one poem and are all part of something larger.  Whitman believed not only in the individual being but also in a larger being that everyone and everything was a part of, in other words the oversoul.  "Song of Myself" is truly filler in the gap between the literary movements because it is so thoroughly transcendental in meaning, yet so precise in describing reality.     Emerson's was completely justified in praising Walt Whitman's work because it is still today very profound and extremely important in respect American literature overall.  Unfortunately a fairly high mentality is required to take in his poetry for all its meaning and worth.  Maturity and openness is key because often criticism of Leaves of Grass spurns from prudish and thoroughly conservative readers 
 What a cool book! I think it is funny how the doorbell keeps ringing and ringing. I can learn how to show equal shares 
 It is just beautiful! Loreena McKennitt has a wonderful voice, and the way she displays it is just amazing! She's not one of those who seem to think their voice is much greater than it really is so they just scream all through the album, she uses her voice to harmonize 100% with the music. I find her music the only one I can listen to and concentrate and relax to at the same time, without getting bored. It works for all ages, all times of the day, anyhow, anywhere, anytime 
 Maurice Castle is working for the Secret Service. In this bizarre profession, he has to deal with leaks, security checks, tensions and suspicions. As Maurice approaches retirement, he realises that some of the decisions he made in the past are now having very serious consequences. In this beautiful novel, the reader discovers what the life of a secret agent is like: he is lonely, isolated and becomes almost neurotic. Greene lays bare a machine, the Secret Service, which overlooks Maurice's subtle and secret motivations that impel him. The characters are beautiful, full of tenderness, excitement and doubt.  Mr Tim Pigott-Smith's performance as a reader of Graham Greene's "The Human Factor" in this audiobook is truly stunning. His voice is very pleasant and his vivid reading adds a further dimension to this already excellent novel 
 "Abel`s Proof" is a nice little book which tackles with the unsolvability issue in mathematics within the context of Niels Henrik Abel`s proof of the unsolvability of quintic equations with radicals. The text is an enjoyable account of a rather important  subject in the whole history of mathematics in some 200 pages, and the quality of writing is laudable. The mathematical details and clarifications are given in boxes along the way, and the book in general is blended with numerous mathematical figures and portraits.   A firm high-school background in basic algebra should suffice to grasp the whole material, yet it has a real potential of teaching a noticeable chunk of mathematics to almost anyone along with valuable comments on its subject-matter.  I recommend this book wholeheartedly to anyone who has some genuine interest in going one step beyond the conventional popular science writing. And the price is right of course 
 I'll admit that I had a lot of expectations after Velvet Elvis. Being a Christian my entire life having read numerous books about faith I wondered what Rob Bell would bring to the table this time. Sex God, yeah that's it. I loved the look of the book and I think that it's worth buying just for the cover but you want to know what's inside...  Rob does a great job of giving us a new perspective on sex without being preachy. Using real life stories and examples he shares his insights on the faith and gives us some understanding into sex. One thing I appreciate is his knowledge of the context of the scriptures. He studies numerous books which he shares with us what he has learned. Many stories we read in the Bible are great, but when they were spoken in the context of that time they make a lot more sense. He breaks a few stories down and does a great job of getting us to take a look at ourselves. In my walk of faith this book if anything got me to open my eyes into the importance of unconditional love which I'm striving toward until the day of perfection.  I would give it a 5 but It's not the best book ever although it is totally worth buying and reading. I highly enjoyed it. My favorite book on Christian living is Driven by Eternity from John Bevere. 
 This is the best tattoo book I have purchased so far (and I have bought quite a few). The pictures are full color, full page and beautiful. From the basic to the outrageous and everything in between, if you are into piercings or tattoos this is a book for you. I took this book to my tattoo salon and it was a fight to get it back from the other clients, and my tattoo artist. This book caused me to do some stuff my moom isnt going to like, but heck, I am a grown-up and I can always wear a turtle neck! I totally, completely recommend this book

 One day, Anna goes to a party with her best friend Ellen; there, they drink alcohol and visit the other guests. On her way home, Anna gets into a car accident, seriously injuring Ellen and Cameron Polk, her brother's girlfriend and the most beautiful and popular girl in school. Sadly, Cameron dies from her injuries. Anna blames herself for what has happened and begins having nightmares.  While celebrating Thanksgiving with her aunt and uncle, Anna's family hears about a peculiar form of therapy called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). Shortly thereafter, Anna begins seeing a psychologist and learns that she's been suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Once the EMDR therapy gets underway, Anna begins seeing the real problems in her life --- her relationship with her brother, her low self-esteem, and the fact that her family is living in fear because of her very controlling and abusive father.  WRECKED paints a beautiful and haunting picture by providing readers with a deep understanding of a teenager's mind. Today, thousands of people suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Hopefully they will be able to get help like Anna did and learn how to live a normal life again.     --- Reviewed by Ashley Hartlau 
 I have no interest in learning a martial art and wanted some easily learned steps to apply, should I get caught up in street crime (I am going to a country, for work, where street crime is high).  I knew a few of the tactics listed in the book (go for the eyes, groin, larynx or carotid artery / jugular).  These were taught to me by an OTC instructor in college.  This book is practical advice that can be learnt fairly quickly.  The chapter on the winning mind is great.  The book is easy to follow, has enough illustrations, and gave me just what I wanted.  Great book 
 This book was the staple of my rocking chair reading as a child, and it spurred my imagination in a dozen ways. First my mother read them to me, then the book became my own. Thirty years since I last pressed my face to its pages, I raised it with my Creative Writing students this morning in modeling a poetry exercise about how words first impact our lives. There is something other-worldly about the illustrations here, too -- surreal perhaps, even unsettling in the way the best art is. I don't pretend that the verse or the images are cutting edge, or high art, but there is in them something wonderfully off-kilter, and soothing at the same time 
 The late Prof. Carroll Quigley,of Georgetown University taught former President Bill Clinton ALL he knows-or so said Clinton at the 1992 Democratic convention.I've had this book for 30 years and its contents NEVER fail to amaze me.If yiu want to know the truth about the Cecil RHOADS sociey,Clinton was a member,or the anglophile Council on Foreign Relations(CFR),Bill was a menber of it too,READ THIS BOOK.Prof Quigley,who died in 1978,was an insiders' insider,he also had an influence on the late Sen.

 Evan Thomas presents an outstanding, extraordinarily researched, and easy to read narrative of one of the Pacific's greatest sea battles in `Sea of Thunder: Four Commanders and the Last Great Naval Campaign 1941-1945'.  Uniquely, and most interesting is the balanced research it is clear Thomas completed in order to share a vivid picture of the mind-set of the combatants at sear: The U.S. Navy appeared to have a view that the Japanese Navy was not up to their combat ready level, and the Japanese Navy viewed the U.S. Navy as being made of individuals not willing to sacrifice for their beliefs. Obviously both perspectives were wrong; Thomas gives understanding of actions based upon these perspectives in a manner never told before.    The Battle of Leyte Gulf, the focus of Thomas' work, is history's largest and most compelling naval battle. Writing from the perspectives of four officers: William Halsey, who commanded the U.S. 3rd Fleet; and Cdr. Ernest Evans, captain of a lowly destroyer, the U.S.S. Johnston; Adm. Takeo Kurita; Adm. Matome Ugaki, readers and historians alike are about to embark on a breath-taking journey onto the high seas of the Pacific where brave men sacrificed in the name of their country. 
 It's a great CD. I'm fascineted with the songs sung by Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog. I recommended to all that like of a good music 
 This is an excellent book, once again showcasing Dr. Twerski's gifted understanding of human behavior and his masterful ability to translate the complex building blocks in life into understandable, recognizable, and workable terms.  This book transcends hope and places clear, easy to follow solutions at our feet.  The vignettes are rich in character and Dr. Twerski's personal experiences validate his expert insights.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this book as a gift for anyone because it is a power-packed very easy read.    
 I watched this documentary on IFC a month ago, and while the credit were running I was on amazon ordering the CD. I have played it almost everyday. This is wonderful, even my 16 year old think its good, after I told im the backgound of the band, he was amazed. This is a must for music lovers 
 JON KATZ really puts it together in this book.  Vary easy to understand. Jon adds his personal experience plus his friends and case studies. He explains dogs behaviors and why they do what they do! Really changed my thoughts on dogs. recommended all dog owners 
 Marion Fontana is an inspiration to all.  I am not quite sure how she found the energy to go to all of the funerals AND fight for the firefighter causes. I am sure that her husband would be so proud of her.  I hope and pray that Mirion and Aidan can piece their lives back together and find happiness that they deserve. She is a very talented writer and her book is an excellent read.  One of those books that you keep on your bookshelf as a reminder when your life seems to be a little bumpy!  An amazing book.  Thank-you for sharing your story.    
   Altough this album came out many years ago, the choas and organized madness that layers this piece still overwhelm even the most hardcore of tablist heads.  even to those outside of the scratch community in the more "public music" mindset that appriciate it for the concept album that it is may still not understand the audio of the album unless they accompany that with the dvd film that was spawned by the album.  This cd is....for lack of a better comparison, hip hops "Tommy", its "Rocky Horror Picture Show", or even "the Wall" to really praise this piece.  To say it so few words, this is not a hip-hop concept album. but rather, it is THE hip-hop EPIC.       
 This is a stellar album by an artist that has defined himself in a totally alternate format from this work. His ability to convey the feeling of these songs make them as great as the orginal aritist versions.  'Good Year For the Roses' almost brings tears to ones eyes with his heartfelt delivery.  The drunken, 'Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down' allows Elvis to open it up a bit and lend his style of punk to a traditional country song. But my favorite is Sittin and Thinkin. Elvis fans and fans of true 'old school' country should love it! Will go down as one of my all time favorite albums 
 This is the second "Inspector Banks" mystery I've read (though it's the first in the series), having started with number eleven. Comparing the two, it's obvious the author has matured greatly in a dozen years. DCI Alan Banks has been in Eastvale, a Yorkshire market town, for only six months, having transferred from London in search of a less hectic lifestyle, and he's beginning to be accepted by the standoffish Northerners. Then he gets caught up in the murder of a semi-senile old woman as well as a series of burglaries, the latest of which ends in a rape. Then there's the peeping tom who's been frightening women as they undress for bed. Add in a disturbingly attractive psychologist and the denizens of his wife's camera club, and you have a nice, complicated, multi-leveled mystery novel filled with generally well-realized characters. There's a certain stiffness in some of the dialogue but this is an auspicious first offering in a very overcrowded field 
 Kinhasa Zaire...1974...One of the most publicized and adored fights of the 1970s, and what better writer to depict the settings than Mailer. This book was a tough find until '96 when the legendary documentary, "When We Were Kings" was released. Mailer's descriptions of the fight throughout the film were compelling enough to make me search out his read.  Many people forget that the fight was postponed for two weeks by Foreman's camp, and the fight almost didn't go off, which leads to chaotic story. Mailer's settings in the Zaire heat and his descriptions of icons such as Hunter Thompson, George Plimpton, Jim Brown, and Don King roaming the lobby of Zaire's Inter-Continental Hotel are so good that you'll feel as if you've been thrown back for two weeks through a time-machine to 1974. A true time period when sports was straight-up for men's men  Now, I'm not so into the romaticized Ali depictions seen through the eyes of Michael Mann, 'limo liberals' and other misinformed academians, and I will never adopt the modern day pre-fabbed tributes to Ali. Accompany this read with a viewing of "When We Were Kings" or with a read of Thomas Hauser's "King of the World" and Mark Kram's "Ghosts of Manila", and you'll catch my drift.   Avoiding a Ali tribute, Mailer loves the sport of boxing, and it shows throughout the book. "The Fight" is a great read that depicts a chaotic time, Zaire, the characters and the life surrounding the classic fight.. Lead with a right-hand jab, and pick this read up. -BD 5/0 
 Anglican bishop N.T. Wright is something of a "rock star" in the rarified realm of modern Christian theology. In this short book  he attempts to answer the question:  "What authority should we assign to Scripture and how should that authority affect our lives as Christians today?"  The really tough part is answering that question in full view of the scientific revolution and rise of (deeply cynical) post-Modernism. Those powerful intellectual currents have poured over our world like a giant tsunami, ripping apart much of the simplistic thinking that passes for popular theology today. So how do we reconcile our world with the unique circumstances and role of Scripture, most of which was written thousands of years ago?  Wright suggests that Scripture is a living, breathing presence in our lives that must be encountered and re-read and re-examined by all Christians on a regular basis, be they conservative, liberal or something in-between. Wrestle with it! Challenge yourself and others -- even your clergy. Get in arguments and struggle for validation. Meditate, pray and ask God for greater insight.  We are, he says, the next act of a great drama that began with Genesis and continues right now in our very lives, both as individuals and as communities of faith. The Bible, Wright insists, must always be read in the context in which it was written -- not disembodied to fit some convenient purpose or ideology. In other words, don't let someone snap a verse here or citation there to "prove" God's intentions.  Years ago, while working in a very conservative town in the Midwest, I overheard a young executive complaining that the TV networks always seemed to air Cecil B. DeMille's movie "The Ten Commandments" during Easter week. "What does the Exodus story have to do with Easter?" he exclaimed. "I can't see any connection there. I guess it's just some kind of Jewish thing."  Wow! It's amazing what that statement says about our collective ignorance and our failure to educate each other in Christian history. N.T. Wright's little book is definitely a step in the right direction.  Final note: Wright's narrative style is sometimes convoluted and difficult. If you have trouble with his style, skip directly to the last chapter where he outlines the core of his argument 
 I love Jayne Castle/Ann Krentz's futuristic world and this was no exception.  Very fun and the play between characters is something I really enjoy.  I do wish she would do more of her flower series (i.e. Amaryllis, Zinnia, Orchid 
 If you like your fairy tales totally authentic and not Disney-sized, you will love this one!  It's Snow-White with all the scary parts left in--the wicked stepmother asking for the liver and lungs of the dead Snow-White, the prince falling in love with a dead body---it would have been a little much for my sons had they not been 8 and 11 at first reading!  As it was, they liked this a lot---perhaps because I don't let them watch horror movies and this is as close as they get!  But besides that, this is a beautiful book.  It's an interesting set-up, with all the writing on alternate double pages and the big picture spreads on the others.  The pictures are extremely detailed and wonderful to look at.  However, if you are doing this as a read-aloud, it's sometimes hard to give the pictures their due, as the kids are eager to hear what happens next and you have to turn to the page to read that.  It's the sort of book you would need to have around the house a lot, so they would be able to look at it at their leisure.  I would say this is most definately for ages 8 and up or so!  It's a gorgeous book, and a more compelling story than the fairy tale I remember 
 This book is up there with Eckhart Tolle's books; Adyashanti is a poet and a clear channel for anyone who wants enlightenment, rather than mind trip city! It is an amazing book 
 As with "Barbarians at the Gate", Helyar makes what could be a boring topic into an enlightening read.  A walk through baseball's past from a business perspective, looking at the issues that shaped the game we  watch today.  If you're a true baseball fan, check out this book 
 Young women who live in the midst of a culture based in artificially manipulated beauty and warped ideas of women should be given this book upon entering adolescence.  This book details the horrors of surgical alteration and acts as a warning that women must combat the unnatural and unfair expectations of men.  Through concise and often humorous commentary, Greer gives many aspects of a man-driven culture a good tongue-lashing and inspires women to turn on their aggressors to tell them that no woman deserves the persecution of a male-imposed perfectionism.  I would highly recommend this book to any woman who found that upon entering the adult world, life was not quite the shining castle and the prince on the white horse she thought it would be 
 This is a terrific little pod.  I'm very pleased with it.  As with all Toshiba products I've owned, it's built well, looks good and does everything it's supposed to.  The only hitch is using that awful Windows Media Player 11 as the sync software.  I switched to Real Player to do my syncing and file maintenance, and it works great 
 Perhaps if Cale wasn't so eclectic, he'd be better known  as one of only white  guys to perform truly natural,relaxed blues.  Question: how come nobody seems to know the right words to the second verse of "Goin' Down",(including Cale), 
 Lots of laughing in this book- My eight month old loves it.  She gets a big kick out of knee-slapping rolling-around-on-the-floor laughing scenes, which of course are played up by the reader for her benefit.  Give it a try 
 Take a motley assortment of thugs, thieves, pickpockets, and prostitutes guarded by a company of red-coated marines and supervised by a handful of bickering officers, set them down half a world away on an unexplored continent, and what do you have?  The beginning of a new nation, Australia.  Thomas Keneally, author of "Shindler's List" and other books, relates the curious enterprise based on official records and personal journals of some of the participants.  There is much specific detail about the men and women of the colony.  As exciting a tale as those of the first settlements of Virginia and Massachusetts.  
 Nowadays men and women take up gardening, landscaping, and natural science. But this wasn't always so. In ancient times, particularly in Rome, women grew and sold flowers. But it wasn't considered the best of jobs. It was in fact a job that gave a girl a bad reputation. She didn't just sell flowers. She also sold herself.  However, over time, growing flowers came to be considered as o.k. as growing fruit, medicinal and vegetable gardens. Monks grew them at monasteries. Nobles had them grown around their castles. So too then did wives in their respected capacities as supervisors of households. Men worked also with plants, but as part of their jobs as doctor, guild member, pharmacist. Some women worked, outside the household, with plants. But this only happened if they were the wives or widows of guild members.  However, flower gardening slipped out of women's hands for a time during the 17th and 18th centuries. How did that happen? And how did women once again become respected flower gardeners?  Men took over, because flowers became a commercial success and a political symbol, on a large scale. This might not have happened, if people had taken the advice of Olivier de Serres. De Serres wrote le theatre d'agriculture et mesnage des champs in 1600. He advised the French to grow well-known and wild flowers that needed little money, care and attention. He particularly pushed growing chamomile, daisies, hyssop, marjoram, mint, sage, thyme, and violets.  However, anyone making decisions about large-scale flower plantings chose what became known as florists' flowers. These flowers needed money, care and attention. These flowers dominatd gardening for the next two centuries, despite de Serres' good advice. These flowers were the demanding, exotic and expensive anemones, carnations, hyacinths, irises, narcissi, ranunculi, and tulips. But in France, these flowers meant money and influence for any with the CULTIVATED POWER to grow them.  French King Louis XIV's properties were known for their gardens and their flowers. Flowers were also the subjects of the carpets, embroidered seats, paintings, and tapestries he owned. Because flowers were in such demand outside the household, men took over the growing and selling of flowers.  The consequences were longlasting in many regards. Exotic flowers, such as tulips, became widely grown and known. Gardening was perfected as a science and art, with accurate and clear recordkeeping. Ancient knowledge wasn't lost. What grew naturally in France was considered less interesting and profitable than what had been grown in ancient Greece and Rome.  The flower trade brought the world together in a marketplace. What grew naturally in France was considered less interesting and profitable than what was being grown outside Europe. The flower trade helped bring about economic and political stability, after many years of bloody civil and religious wars. Flowers, such as the fleur-de-lys, united people around the central figure of the king. The noble and royal gardens also brought in admiring and important visitors, royalty, and diplomats.  But this was all part of the centralizing rule of the sun king, Louis XIV le grand. It was all part of trying to pull the different regions together so that all would recognize Paris as the capital and the king as the final power. But the next kings, Louis XV and particularly Louis XVI, couldn't keep up the pace. People might have put up with beautifully kept up and sometimes edible flowers planted on top of good crop land. They couldn't accept good crop land turned to gardens falling into disrepair. Exotics had become familiar. Flowers were no longer symbols of a clever monarch. The French revolution turned the country in a more practical direction: everyone should have beloved King Henri IV's promised chicken in every pot, grow plants that had always grown naturally in the region, and eat their own bread.  After the late 18th century, women once again took up gardening, landscaping, and natural science. In our day, there's probably not such a seesaw between men and women in those fields. There's also probably not such a seesaw between exotics and natives. Plenty of people would listen to a modern-day de Serres' advice. But also plenty of people would try for gardens balanced between native and non-native plants 
 A great view of a Cuban traditionalist hetrosexual, and a homosexual of the arts who loves his nation.  The Gay artist hides his actual ambition, (a bit deceptive) for his yearning to be free, and his love for the straight man.  Enough support cast to add a bit of flavor to the picture.  It's ending is on a wonderful positive note.  Each gets what they want in some form, or fashion.  Sounds like some homosexual dreams even here in America --- to be free, & totally equal!  Are people free in the US is up to one's interpretation.  ENJOY THIS FILM! Hey the guy does get the girl.  See, something for everyone 
 Some reviewers see this book as a "gloom'n'doom" "Malthusian" feeding of technophobia, but I disagree.  Look at the news - reports of job losses despite increased productivity and corporate profits are not going to go away.  Technological advances make this an inevitability.  What Rifkin ultimately questions is how we deal with that - we could either head towards great social upheavals because of mass unemployment leading to people being unable to provide for their own basic needs, or we could enjoy a cultural and social rebirth where people are free from wage slavery and are free to pursue meaningful and fulfilling endeavors.    Rifkin's surveys of the development of the third sector (NGOs, arts, sports, social services, religious organizations, etc.), proposals for the guaranteed annual income for everyone, usage of time dollars, and increase in volunteerism does not indicate that he's some kind of paranoid nut who's screaming that the sky is falling - in fact, he comes across as being more cautiously optimistic.  These are the similar ideas about a work-free (meaningless work, that is) future that R. Buckminster Fuller Robert Anton Wilson and Bertram Russell have written about.  If some might think that this book is "leftist anti-corporate propaganda", it is not - it's quite non-partisan; he may espouse the idea of a guaranteed annual income which most might distastefully find "socialistic", but from the capitalist point-of-view, how can consumers buy products to support a corporation's profits if they don't have any money in the first place 
 Rap music today is a tragic lack of creativity. Its not real hip hop. This album, brings back the good feeling that is real hip hop. Honestly, The Light is a song that never gets old, thats real. If you don't have this album, get it. 
 Dr. Gary Habermas received his PhD from the University of Michigan with a speciality in the philosophy of history.  Dr. Habermas is very devoted to historical methodology.  He has shown this in class (being a student in his philosophy seminar entitled 'The Philosophy of History and the Historical Jesus').  In class Dr. Habermas spent several weeks on historical methodology, and his book on the historical evidence for Christ has an entire appendix on historical methodology 
  For such a long time, I have hunted and searched for a book about virginity and the purpose(s) behind it. Just about all Christian single books were about dating. Gift-wrapped by God is an excellent book for women (and men). The book talks about the reasons God intends for us singles to keep our virginity. In a world where having sex in or outside of marriage is the majority, those who are not having sex feel outcasted and often contemplate if refraining from sex is worth it. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS. It is not just about giving yourself physically to your future spouse but it is about giving your unindivided attention, your total self to God. Refraining from sex is your worship to God. The book even talks about renewing your life back to God if the gift has been unwrapped. There are several study questions, poems, scriptures, and life stories to encourage singles to continue the path of purity. I recommend this book to every single. Every single should find out about his/her gift wrapper, for we are all gifts from God. 
 I never really dug Bob's "blue collar" mentality, but his Silver Bullet Band truly WAS hot as a jumper cable at a Georgia funeral.  And I was able to tune out his "Ramblin' Gamblin' Man" stuff when I started (huh-huh-huh) "going out dancing" every weekend in '78-'79; that song "The Fire Down Below"....well, let's just say, the song could be interpreted more than ONE way (wherever you are, Doreen, you were absolutely the BEST).  And I'm babbling, but that's OK, because I purchased "Bob's Best Vol. I" for all those songs that had, indeed, ignited the fire down below.  And the finest two songs that Bob had ever written (well, for Rock and Rollers like me), "Fire Down Below," and "Her Strut" just.....weren't there.  I swapped the cd for a used copy of "Night Moves."   Ah, but just a couple of months ago, somebody at Capitol or whoever must've received some "feedback" or something, because here's Vol. 2 - and those coveted two songs are #2 and #3! Maybe "Rock and Roll really doesn't ever forget 
 A good thriller, that was very Grisham.   Delivered on exactly what you read Grisham for.  
 The shorts presented herein are very fine and funny material, even the shorts that aren't real L&H shorts per se because they either appeared together but hadn't been teamed yet or because only one of them were appearing.  The strongest material of course comes from the two proper L&H shorts, 'Liberty' and 'We Faw Down'; I also very much like 'The Lucky Dog,' the film in which they first appeared together, even though they were nowhere near getting teamed yet.  'Love 'Em and Leave 'Em' is the original silent version of what later became 'Chickens Come Home'; but for the difference of roles (Ollie and not Jimmy Finlayson plays the blackmailed husband running for mayor in the sound version), it's such a practically word-by-word and gag-by-gag retelling it's uncanny.  'Bromo and Juliet,' the Charley Chase short in which Ollie appears as a police officer, is very funny and enjoyable too; it's a criminal shame that today this great funnyman and performer is all but forgotten.  'Along Came Auntie,' which was rescued from near-decomposition, is also enjoyable, but overall I'd peg it as the weakest of the six shorts presented here.  Of course the material on the discs in this collection are fantastic, but it just seems like they were assembled without rhyme or reason, like by theme or chronological order.  There are however a few minor flaws; it appears that this DVD is like the others in this collection in that it just starts playing right away, or at least it does so on my computer's DVD player.  You have to click the Menu button on the control bar to be brought to the main menu to select the short you want to see yourself, and if you're only interested in seeing one, four, and six, say, you have to repeat this every time instead of having it automatically start and the beginning and not display the menu by itself until the final short is over.  The background music, even if some of it may have been the original backing soundtrack in theatres, can also become repetitive and monotonous.  Sure it's not EXACTLY the same throughout every short, but it's not very varied either 
 This is without a doubt one of the greatest acoustic guitar albums ever.  Ralph Towner's 12 string and 6 string excursions are beautifully recorded and performed to perfection.  The opening, "Spirit Lake", is as dramatic as any Aaron Copeland composition.  The imagery and drama of the piece is absolutley stunning.  His interpretations of John Abercrombie's "Ralph's Piano Waltz" and "Timeless", are other album highlights.  The latter comes very close to surpassing the original version, which is no small undertaking.   Ralph Towner's Solo Concert redefines acoustic music, mixing excellent compositions with sophistiated improvisations.  No one should ever buy any other solo acoustic guitar album without buying this one first.    
 I actually read this book several years ago and purchased this copy to give to a friend to explain why China is going to be so difficult to deal with. China thinks we owe them big because of what happened 140-160 years ago. This is not ancient history to them -- it is the present and they are not going to be our friends after what happened then. 
 Ok, I grew up on a Pink Floyd music diet and have owned every single album of theirs and their solo offsprings.  But of all, this one has touched me the deepest.  It was the first CD I got when I began replacing my album collection and it is probably the most played ever.  It is musically very talented at times, albeit with some strange moments, but it always manages to take me to that special place, reminding me of the happy times and great memories growing up.  Clapton's work is the best I have heard from him (IMHO), I just wish he played like that more often.  Listening to anything else from Clapton now seems too restricted in comparison.  I recommend this album to anyone that appreciates music from the heart.  Music is the best natural legal drug and this is a perfect example 
 I was curious to listen to David Zinman and the Zurich Orchestra after all I had read in  the CD guide books and magazines. This is my sixth full cycle (Karajan 1963 and 1977, Klemperer,Bernstein/VPO and Toscanini) and these days is definetely my favourite. Zinman brings new life to the symphonies- period. The Barenreiter edition may play a role in the freshness of the music but the passion of maestro and orchestra makes you feel as if you are present in the music hall, being a spectator of a live performance.  The first symphonies were the greatest surprise for me, and I can now see the maturation of Beethoven, where as the older approaches interepreted these pieces as small "Eroicas". There is no doubt there are better interepretations of individual symphonies out there - ex. Carlos Kleiber on the 5th, Klemperer on the "Eroica"-old style or Furtwangler on the 1952 recording of the "Choral" - but this fact can not overshadow what I find as an excellent set at a great price 
 Just what I would have suspected from a great writer like Jeffrey Deaver..The collection of short stories are written in such a way that I found the endings surprising yet perfect. 
 I came across the Immortal Yi Soon Shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels. Up to this time I had never heard of it, but immediately I was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing. As I continued to watch (it had English subtitles fortunately) I became enthralled by the acting, plot and historical theme. With a little detective work, I learned that I had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over 100 episodes. I told my wife how good it was, and after we watched an episode together, she and I both became die-hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it. We managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television. Nearly every episode was better than 90% of the Hollywood movies out there. If you like, action, drama, amazing three-dimensional characters with incredible actors, intersting history, and some of the best writing I have seen on television, or anywhere for that matter, check this out 
 I am impressed with this book.  It is basically a written "dialogue" between Dinesh and a Student named Chris.  Dinesh responds to Chris' questions and manages to tie in background information and detail that support his positions.  He also tries to keep it light hearted--which helps.  Some who read this in a dour state most certainly don't get it.  On page 102 he nails down the absurd and implausible efforts to populate university education with "proportional" feminist writing.  He makes a very good case that color blindness and merit are the only way to ensure a heathly multicultural society.  On page 216 he talks about how in the short-term Repbulican's need to let the Democrats be the party of the blacks and black demands.  For the long term his advice is to continue efforts to grow the economy, increase national unity, merit and color-blindness.  A phenomena for me personally is that Mr. D'Souza takes issues which I have historically "felt" more than understood and articulates them with erudition I envy.  It is an excellent work. 
 Polchinski's book on string theory is a very well written book about the subject. Also, the problems given in the book are valuable for a further understanding. Using it together with the book by Green, Schwarz, Witten one will afterwards have indeed little problems understanding the papers on this subject. However one caveat: if one reads this book, he or she shoudl be always aware that this topic is still deeply a research subject and by no means settled like mechanics. If this is always kept in mind, then this book is of considerable help in understanding one of the current frontiers of physics 
 If you are into spiritual exploration and you love watching basketball then you will find this an amazing book. This book captures beatutifully how you can apply Zen Buddhist philosophies to daily life (although maybe coaching Michael Jordan is not ordinary daily life ...). Especially interesting if you want to understand how you can use Zen Buddhism to stimulate teamwork. Sacred Hoops gave me many ideas on which to reflect. I highly recommend it. 
 I have been a fan of Aurelie Sheehan's work for many years, enjoying her lyrical prose and deep insights.  Now, with History Lesson for Girls, I'm delighted to discover that she has turned a corner and written a page turner - an engrossing work on many levels.Told with true affection, Sheehan is able to show us the humor in even the direst family situation, yet never exploits her characters.History Lesson is reminiscent of The Ice Storm in that they both include the period of the 1970s as a character.  For those of us who came of age during the me generation we will recognize the landscape that Sheehan has depicted.  For those who haven't, it is indeed a most enjoyable history lesson 
 This should be mandatory reading for anyone doing moderate risk activities, let alone thru-hikers, backpackers, mountain climbers, etc. It certainly made me rethink the things I do when backpacking. It makes fascinating reading, but to summarize what I got out of it: Be sure that what you are thinking of as many years of experience, is not really many years of being very lucky 
 Alan Watts writes a down-to-earth overview of the fundmantals of Zen absent of the latest hype given this recently popular philisophy.  Written before the onslaught of Zen commercialism, he focuses on the essense of the  religion and its profound spirituality which had previously been shrouded  on a veil of mystery and pardox 
 This book is a wonderful Hands-on addition to a colonial unit.  My kids really enjoyed making the projects 
 well I find it informative and almost all of the 'unix' realted programs  where in there 
 Excellent overall view of the events of 1956 in Hungary. Personalized stories are those of other refugie families I met in Austria in 1957-58; or like my family's. Brings the events close for the reader, although slanted toward Cold War view from the West. 
 This book gives a great overall view of Children's Ministry.  It helps the reader realize that Children's Ministry isn't just sticking children in a classroom and teaching them stuff.  There is more to it than that.  Great book 
 Baldacci shows his storytelling mastery.  Saving Faith will not disappoint with this plot driven race to the finish.  A fascinating look into the world of Washington lobbyists and the interests they serve.  Plenty of blackmail and surprising twists. Top notch elements of suspense and mystery will keep the pages turning. 
 it was easy to order and very affordable and they were here quickly...I want to get more...thank 
 me and my friend both watched and we thought Cash money did their best. We think the main point of the movie was showin what they grew up in their past and  what they lived through. As in a southern movie there is a lot of slang or ebonics,senseless profanity and death.if you look past all of that it's a southern staple, believe that dhere. So overall, ya shouldn't worry 'bout the not so good actin', or effects. Just concentrate on the story line.                      YA HEARD ME!                             $$$$$$$$$$$                                  hood,from my head down to my shoes 
 I first attempted AGATB in audiobook form that I got from the library.  I always have trouble paying attention to audiobooks so I don't know why I bothered, but I'm extremely glad I did with this one!  There I was not paying too much attention to the reading, when all of a sudden I WAS paying attention to it.  Something about the words I was hearing grabbed my attention and I was struck by the way the writing style was able to give a surreal quality to the story.  That did it: I had to read the book, not listen to it being read.  Only then would I be able to give the book the attention it deserves. I was not disappointed with my decision, obviously.     The writing is beautiful and atmospheric, dreamy. Many of the situations Gemma and the girls she befriends go through are metaphors representing and exposing the oppressiveness of society toward women. The girls are all going through the maturation stages to becoming women and it was intense reading about how the restrictions in society affected them psychologically and physically. Reading AGATB often felt like reading literature...Take the title for instance.  What is this "great and terrible beauty?"  The girl on the cover?  No, it's the manifestation of power.  Think about that one for a little bit.  Many other thought-provoking and just beautiful quotes abound in this YA novel, and many social themes are addressed subtly and assuredly.  Much of the social commentary is still valid today.  Bray definitely wants teenage girls of this day and age to open their eyes to the fact that our society wants to mold them into certain kinds of images.  She also wants them to look at how they perpetuate these stereotypical images of themselves, simply because they confuse popularity (from conformity to societal expectations) with empowerment.  Even adults can appreciate the challenges Gemma and the other girls go through when facing the evils of the fantasy realm, as well as the evils of the Victorian realm, and pick up on compelling social themes and messages that are deftly and adroitly immersed in a fantasy plot, under the guise of a YA novel.  In addition, I especially recommend reading the extra "reader's circle" questions for discussion - which are very thought-provoking and bring up many interesting points - and the interview with Libba Bray, also very intriguing and gives you a good idea of what the author intended to get accross to the reader through the book.   
 I purchased this and am thrilled with the upper tray.  The lower is not as easy for me because my lower teeth are a bit uneven but none the less, the whitening is so dramatic.  I actually ended up taking the upper tray and using it on my lower teeth for more coverage.  I give this 5 stars, but in my opinion, I would like Aquafresh to re-design the lower tray to match the size of the upper.   The strips and paint on methods never worked well for me.  The Aquafresh product was absolutely fantastic 
 This text is a great resource for any teacher who wants or needs to use music in their classroom. Many times as music educators we are expected to teach in areas we do not feel the best at. As a music teacher this will add to your confidence and give you creative ideas for class. As a classroom teacher, it will help you understand music and music notation beyond what your students need so that you feel confident to teach the basics to your students and use music as a supplemental tool in your teaching. I highly recommend this text 
 A Collection of Wisdom is highly recommended, whether you are looking for a quick reference guide organized by resource and topic, or for a broad overview of various philosphies and 'wisdoms' across history and geography 
 I found this book, with its exquisite pictures, sexy and very entertaining. The women are lovely, sexy and strong, and as a gay woman, I truly appreciate that combination 
 This is one of the earliest and still one of the best introductions to socio-historical psychology, the study of how individual human intelligence develops in interaction with people and the environment.  In concert with  many contemporary approaches in cognitive science today, Lev Vygotsky, A.R.  Luria and A.N. Leontiev argued that human intelligence is  characteristically mediated through objects and social activity.  Humans  think through tools.  Talking to oneself, for example, is not an irrelevant  activity.  Putting one's actions into speech is a way of focusing one's  consciousness on the problem.  This kind of speech is not pointless, but  rather a cognitive tool that gives one a greater awareness of one's own  actions and makes it easier to modify these actions--a point that Vygotsky  proved with research on how children solved problems.  Much of human  activity involves making use of tools, signs, and activities, the kinetic  melodies of action and conceptualization  that make us smart, and through  which we are able to accomplish the uniquely human feats of complex  intellectual action. This is an excellent place to begin studying Vygotsky  and activity theory.  If you like this you will also like A.R. Luria's *The  Making of Mind*, and the classics *The Man With A Shattered World* and *The  Mind of a Mnemonist*, the books that inspired Oliver Sacks' writing 
 This is an amazing book full of color pictures of many of the itmes to be made. However, I do advise you, that this is not a book for beginners. I came to realise this after attempting the Chestnut Puzzle Cake. I knew it was going to be a tough task to accomplish, so I tried it with boxed cake mixes, and frosting from a tub at first. ( No one knew the difference). The instructions are worded so that anybody can make the recipes, and some have illustrations to aide in the task. They are time consuming, but the extra effort is worth it in the end. If you plan on purchasing, and making the recipes, I reccomend taking a picture of it before you consume 
 I suspect that seeing the movie first may have spoiled this book a bit for me.  Being familiar with the characters ahead of time robbed me of the novelty of being introduced to them here.  The characters are definitely the strength of this book, and what characters they are!  From the delicious nastiness of Malfoy and the selfishness of the Dursleys, to the good-natured clumsiness of Neville and Hermione's know-it-all attitude, these are interesting people that capture our imaginations and make us want to know them more.  While the story in this first book is, perhaps, a bit simplistic, the larger story of Harry Potter must start somewhere, and this is our introduction to the people that will help to tell that tale.  I'm looking forward to the rest of the books.. 
 A truly heartwarming tale of a sprit trying to rise. I think it's trying. I also think it's a warm uplifting. The choir of frogs is cute, and I will happiliy listen to them anytine 
 This book has it all, the perfect addition to a Package Designers Library. Krasovec and Ms. Klimchuk have thoroughly explained to how a package is developed and also show the thought process of today's package designer. This book has been a long time coming 
 rose royce was tight my faves are wishing on a star, and love don't live here anymore and can't forget the classic I'm goin down remade by mary j blige, ynv, and more recently camron ooh boy. and can't forget the ghetto classic car wash you ain't ghetto til you jammed off that cut so if you feeling rose royce you should get this and keep daddy rich's memory alive 
 Being a hard rock affectionado by heart, I find myself to be more critical of those bands who do not make a steady rotation as part of my  CD listening diet.  But now and again, when the moment hits, I gather a pleasure from listening  to greatest hits collections from Christopher Cross, America, Orleans, Ambrosia and many others of the same genre.  Upon recieving this CD, I slipped it into my CD changer and couldn't help but start to relax and truely enjoy the soft sounds of what is one of the great 1970s harmonic duos. But what makes this stand out from the others is the cross of the many influences that I hear.  With its simple, plain spoken pleasing mix of country, pop, rock, and southern charm each song lays out a chorus of gentle harmonies, piano, and accoustic guitars.  There is something so unpretentious about England Dan and his partner John Ford Coley, that you can't help but be left smiling.  My favorite track is "Lady," from 1976's "Nights Are Forever," record.  Reading the story of this song in the included insert, I learned that it was about Mariko, a lady the duo met while in Japan.  And it was recording engineer Kyle Lehning's idea to name the song "Lady."  A wonderful line in the song goes like this, "Since I was out chasing a song, I left you standing alone, in the morning light....Lady, do you still seak the mysteries of life, or have you become some business man's wife.  Lady, when you stare up at the stars out in the night, do you still think this old world will ever turn out all right, do you ever think of me........Do you ever think we will share those moments again." My goodness, so simple in its wording, but that, that is what I am speaking of when comparing England Dan and John Ford Coley to their counterparts Ambrosia, Bread, Christopher Cross and Paul Davis.  While all of these bands had some immensely gifted songwriters and musicians, it is the simplicity in the wording of "Lady."  Without having to use long over-indulgent lyrics, we get the point that this was a lady that for whatever reason made an impact on Dan and John's lives.  And on all the songs on this greatest hits CD, it is the same.   And it is the same with We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again," "Westward Wind," "It's Sad To Belong," and the soft rock classic "I'd Really Love To See You Tonight."  Even thoughtful pieces like "The Prisoner," which is a moody soulful song that opens with what sounds like a Recorder/Flute, allows Dan and John to speak of the Bahai'i faith founder, Baha'u'llah, without coming on "preachy."  But instead "The Prisoner" comes across as an earnest feeling of a faith that the two had made a big part of their personal lives.  Each song is written quietly and with their amazing vocal talents, the two bring each piece to life.  Decades after Dan and John have left the charts of America, these recordings are timeless.  Listening to them, I remembered a time long ago, when I was a teenager discovering girls for the first time, cruising Napa's Jefferson St, in my Z28, and hearing these classics songs that will forever have a secure place in pop music history.  And that is not at all a bad legacy to have left behind...........   
 Changing tone from the Sherlock Holmes tales, Doyle presents us the eccentric and irascible Dr. Challenger, a scientist that has travelled in the Amazon basin. One day (or so he says) he finds, in  a remote village, the drawings and testimonies of a deceased American explorer, which allow him to think of the preservation of plants and animals from the Jurassic Era, in a secluded selvatic spot surrounded by a natural basaltic wall. But it happens that, in the European scientific circles, the affirmations of the egotist doctor have been recieved with laughter and despise. Nevertheless, a young and foolish journalist, compelled by his demanding girlfriend to look for adventures and glory, decides to believe in him. After a stormy session at the Zoological Institute, a commission is formed to try and find the spot. Besides the reporter Malone, the commission includes the skeptic Prof. Summerlee and the adventurer Sir John Roxton. After many adventures, the four explorers find the spot. It is a true trip to the remotest past. Isolated by its geographic and climatic conditions, the Jurassic Era has survived. It is a world of dinosaurs and the strangest survivors of millions of years ago. There are some gigantic but thankfully vegetarian dinosaurs, as well as the hideous creatures who eat them. There are pterodactiluses, sea-snakes, etc. But the greatest surprise I will leave for you to read by yourself.   This is a delightful entertainment by the gifted Doyle. The fascinating world of European Edwardian science is merrily portrayed, the adventure is a lot of fun and the characters are memorable. Much recommended 
 The Optika MP100 Pro Photo Monopod is surprisingly sturdy, functional and well-made.  It is supplied with a reasonably decent quality zippered nylon case with carrying strap.  No, it is not "professional grade", but it is something every amateur photographer can use for weekend shooting.  I've used it both with digital still and camcorder, where it offers respectable improvement in long-distance shots (versus trying to hold the camera still, or propping it up on the roof of the car, a not-nearby-enough fence post, and so on.)  Certainly a LOT handier than the old tripod!  I bought two, keeping them ready-for-action in the trunk of my cars.  Highly recommended 
 The Breakfast Club, one of the best movies out there. Timless no matter what's your age or what year you were born in your sure to love this movie! :- 
 Every once in a while we stumble across a book, movie, person, or event that somehow changes our lives.  This book had that effect on me.  Cheri Huber has written a book in longhand, "to be read with the heart and not the head", and has somehow managed to point out with gentleness and compassion how our conditioning has brought us suffering.  I love how this acts as a wake-up call and not a scolding.  I love how your eyes get opened, yet you don't get a feeling that you have to run out and "change".  I wish this were required reading in schools across the country 
 These are first sketches that prefigure the later and greater work and, as such, they may be useful as an intro to the "Waste Land." Those with no desire to return to that godforsaken place will find these discrete bits more digestible and not lacking in Eliot's uniquely haunting music. Among my favorites are "Interlude in London" and "Oh little voices in the throats of men." For those interested in tracing the voices in Eliot's "echo chamber," there are copious notes detailing his allusions and borrowings.If you are a serious Eliot connoisseur, you will be tickled by his long-lost bawdy verse 
 This is a beautiful story about an idyllic childhood and the loss of innocence.  The Kite Runner follows the story of Amir, the son of a wealthy businessman in Afghanistan, and Hassan, the son of Amir's father's servant. As children the boys are inseparable until a horrible event changes them and their lives forever.  Amir and his father flee to America during the take over of Afghanistan by the Soviets.  While in America Amir continues to be haunted by the tragic childhood event while he finally grows close to his father.  Events lead him back to Afghanistan and eventually Amir finds a way to redeem himself.  This isn't a book about politics nor does it feel like a lecture, instead you are given a glimpse into the tortured soul of a man who wasn't there for his best friend.  A man who spends his life trying to live up to his fathers expectations and always feeling like he has fallen short.  You can't help but identify with the characters in this novel even though they come from a culture vastly different then our American culture.  The timing novel also coincides with current events and makes the people and city of Afghanistan come alive.  
 Moshe Dayan was born in palestine to Russian immigrants and was thus a Sabra, a palestinian jew.  At an early age he guarded the kibbutz Deganiah along with other youths against local Arab marauders in the Galilee.  His namesake was another youth named Moshe (Moses), an immigrant from Russia who was attacked and killed by marauders while he was on his way to get medicines for Moshe Dayan's father.  The first few decades of twentieth century life for jews in palestine were back breaking hard work; for Moshe Dayan's family, they worked to transform mosquito-infested swamplands into lush, fertile farmlands and battled bouts of malaria regularly like many other zionist pioneers.  The foundation of the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) was the Hashomer (the Guard) formed in 1909, a few years before Dayan's birth, which gave rise later to the Haganah (the Defense) and Palmach of which Moshe Dayan and Yitzhak Rabin were members.  These forces for the jews in palestine were indispensible to the jews' survival in many ways.  He was groomed for leadership at an early age trained militarily by the English general Orde Wingate and by the zionist leader, Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion.  Dayan is known mostly for his role as Israel's defense minister and his military service.  My curiousity about him was peaked by my trip to Israel in 2000.  I thoroughly enjoyed Dayan's autobiography.  It was interesting to read about Israel's early history from the vantage point of one of Israel's most famous defenders.  
 I have played guitar for well over forty years but only during the past five have I poured myself into learning jazz guitar.  Jody Fisher's method is an outstanding guide.    If you diligently work with through it's pages you will master an wealth of material.  A serious student will learn how chords are structured, a vast array of chords in many voicings, diatonic chord scales (which are a cornerstone of jazz theory) modal playing and improvisation.    The lessons are well organized so that a student who knows how to practice and works with passion and persistence can succeed in mastering this challenging but beautiful way of playing. The CD which accompanies the book is straight forward and helpful in giving you material you can play over so that you are playing the material in real time as you would with a teacher or another guitarist.  I can say that my playing and knowledge of theory has improved tremendously.  This is not a method for the faint of heart but if you are looking for a way to grow in you playing I would recommend this book whole heartedly. I'm looking forward to diving into the rest of the series.     
 Preceded by the landmark 2-l.p. "The Payback" and prior to the popular "Get Up Offa That Thing" and several other impressive studio efforts, "Hell" somehow got misplaced somewhere in the  Soul Album Pantheon. It continued the trend of more mellow, melodic, and  lyrically deeper James Brown music, probably the result of some Soul  searching for a less strident sound - the "riffin' - ravin'"  James seemed to suddenly transform into a more considered artist.  (Ofcourse, that is a matter of taste - I'll still listen to "Mother  Popcorn" any time of day!). In any event, this second in a row 2-l.p.  set contains some of his most complex and impressive tracks: the  attractively arranged opener "Coldblooded"; the title tune, which  should have become a staple of Progressive F.M. at the time; "Sayin'  And Doin' It", to me a ready made Top 20 duet with Lyn Collins;  "Don't Tell A Lie About Me And I Won't Tell The Truth About You",  a slow funk with one of the most entertaining intros in music history. As  far as the expected recuts, my favorite is the third remake of  "Sometime" (originally recorded in 1958 as "It Was  You", then done as "Sometime" in 1969)- it's a simple,  affecting ballad. The much-revisited "I Can't Stand Myself (When You  Touch Me" is here presented as "I Can't Stand It '76', and it's  8:08 of controlled mayhem - everybody's got to hear this one, if only for  the JB/Maceo/John Morgan interplay 
 Dylan interperts these traditional blues and folk tunes as good as he interperts his own material. My favorites are Blood In My Eyes,Delia and Love Henry, but every song is a gem. I would prefer to see him perform these songs solo, than to see him perform his great songs from the 60's. Really 
 i listen to a lot of different types of metal and i have to say out of most hardcore bands this one reminds me of hatebreed which is a good thing i love hatebreed and these guys are worth more attention do yourself a favor and buy this album if you like hardcore meta 
 I just finished watching "Inside Man," and it reminded me of this movie - which is far better. There's probably not much sense in my trying to add to what all the others here have already said. If you enjoy twisted thrillers, sharp acting, and trick endings, then this is the movie for you 
 A guy gets shot into space and returns to Earth as a crusty, cockeyed spazzbo... and he spends the whole movie stumbling around and bumping into things. Pure genius... if you need sleep, BUY THIS MOVIE NOW! 
 If you have ever REALLY been in love, or wanted to be, you will relate like a bulls-eye to this film. I can't think of one thing that could be changed to improve this movie, and I can't say that about any other film.  The devotion of a mother to a husband lost in war, a little boy to an art and to the provider of that art. A town to the images from a far off and very different world. Then this little boy becomes a man constantly looking for the devotion from a woman, that ideal love he discovers from collecting film edits over many years. In life, he can only find love and devotion in the images on a screen. There is great joy and great regret, the director and writer play your emotions like a drum. Don't miss this, buy it, give it to people you love or to someone who needs to understand the difference between love and simple lust or infatuation. You laugh and you cry, I'm a guy hardened by the bumps in life and it brought tears streaming down my face. Get this, I have a number of different copies, but on Super Bowl Sunday, it was shown on TCM, and I found myself unable to turn the channel to the game, it's that special and engrossing. Enjoy, Steve Gilbert, A 
 Easy to understand with numerous illustrations and very good explanations.  I think the unique style with which this book is written, will help even a student who previously had bad or little knowledge of the different  sides of the subject of Biochemistry 
 This had much more than I thought it would - fun, action/romance/relationship movie that has something for people of all ages.  The additional features disc was a lot of fun and gave us a new appreciation of all the work (and fun) that went into making this movie 
 Like the CD for "Snow White," this splendidly arranged remaster includes not only the few (yet classic) vocals ("A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes," "Sing, Sweet Nightingale," "The Work Song," "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo," "So This is Love") and a song that never made it to film ("I'm in the Middle of a Muddle"), but all the ambient background instrumental music that wasn't released on the original vinyl, carefully arranged according to its original playing order.  Scenes flow through your mind as you listen, and you resolve to replay your video at first opportunity.  Track 10, "Locked in the Tower...," includes wonderful mouselike skittering music that evokes perfectly the image of Cinderella's rodent friends scurrying through the walls.  Like so much classic Disney soundtrack music, these pieces are so perfectly matched to the action that you understand why the studio gained the place it did in popular culture and the critical mind: Disney and his people never thought of themselves as making "just kiddie movies," but as craftsmen and perfectionists 
 I picked this up on a whim.  I had a gift card to a local book store and remembered finding the movie adaptation quite entertaining.  The result was a character study that blew me away.  The subject matter of the mountain gorillas Fossey studied was only part of it.  The person that came out in book was the true catch for me.  Dian Fossey was as human as anyone else.  A truly driven and flawed person who impacted science across the world 
 What can I say? I've been listening to Dulli since the Whigs days and he just keeps evolving, hybridizing music and building using his resources of amazing musicains...The guy's a genius and if you can't tell that from the album see him perform live and try to prove me wrong.. 
 This is an outstanding resource  -- an excellent and comprehensive introduction for non-profit administrators who want to learn more about fundraising, but also a fresh perspective for professional grantseekers 
 The Double Helix was a one of the books on my high school biology teacher's reading list for the class. The name itself, The Double Helix, had shied me away from reading it; it sounds like some boring old book that will describe the structure of DNA in some very big and boring words. However, after finally reading the book, I completely changed my thoughts on this book. I found the novel to be an easy and exciting to read in an almost fictious hero-like story.  Watson's story is not just a mere account of the events that occurred, but it also contains many of his personal thoughts and views of the events. Watson's purpose for writing The Double Helix was to explain that scientific research was a combination of "the contradictory pulls of ambition and the sense of fair play." Watson involves the reader in the "race" of the DNA structure with Linus Pauling and in the underhanded use of Rosalind Franklin's X-ray data. I, like many others, was sucked into the thrill of Watson's first-hand account of this dishonest race. During many points in the course of the novel, I was anxiously waiting to turn the page to see what Watson or Crick might do next. As Sir Lawrence Bragg puts it in the foreword, "I do not know any other instance where one is able to share so intimately in the researcher's struggle and doubts and final triumph." The Double Helix was not only a good read, but also it has reinvigorated my spirit in the field of research, especially the active field of genetics. My first year of college courses in chemistry and biology had began to turn me away from research in particular areas, for the courses just did not seem to interest me anymore. However, this book has provided me with a new avenue into the exciting world and life of scientific research; I am again looking forward to going into the genetic research field. I observed a very interesting point in the book, which is that all the data and diagrams that were discussed throughout the novel are also taught in our chemistry classes; it is in this fact that I find science's beauty, that only 50 years ago this data was used to solve the structure of a totally unknown molecule/idea and is now taught in elementary chemistry classes. The Double Helix is an exceptional novel that I recommend to all 
 Falwellian Fundamentalists and Borgian Liberals will find much to hate in this book, as will hard-line scholars who will no doubt demand footnotes, endnotes and references.  As a popular presentation of the story and tenor of the Hebrew Scriptures (or Old Testament) this book is a resounding success.  It presents the Mr. Cahill's perspective on this history in a clear and even persuasive manner.  The vital contribution of the "Jews" to human destiny is plainly set forth in beautiful prose from cover to cover.  
 If you want to understand subversion, this book will take you through all aspects and it will give you the knowledge you need to plan your own implementation.  The online version is good and for things you would like to have a better solution than what the book describes, looking them up in the current online book may show that the feature you wanted has already been implemented. However, the value of having your own paperback version cannot be overstated if you need to know the product well or you're responsible for planning an implementation of it 
 This overall was a pretty good book and like most World of Darkness material put out by White Wolf it was packed with Information and Ideas.What I liked most about this book is the "Sample" Precinct that takes up about 1/3 if not more of this book. They have put a lot into the NPC characters, which are ready for use upon opening the book. The book itself is not essential to have for a WOD game, but is filled with a lot of practical real life applications of Law Enforcement, which DM's and Players either abuse or fail to put in. Anyone whom has played WOD has either been or had someone in their party that practices reckless abandon and can kill whomever they want, even police. Now one thing which I think needs to be said, and lets give our "boys in blue" some credit. If you kill a Cop you become a "Cop Killer" in the eyes of all other Law Enforcement and you have just signed your name up for a Lawful Version of a Lynch Mob, this book addresses this beautifully.  I would recommend this book if you want your players to remember that they still are vulnerable even with all there supernatural powers, and to give a much more Real feel to Law Enforcement in your game. I also enjoyed the Merits; especially one, which specifically is meant for those, characters who want to be cops and the Status/Connections that go with it. 
  A Room with a View is a delightful novel by E.M. Forster.  Is is a bit of a romance and was probably realistic fiction in the time period in which it was written.  The main character is a young lady named Lucy.  Lucy and her cousin Charlotte have traveled to Italy, and they meet a lot of interesting characters in their hotel.  The Emersons are a middle-class father and son who offer to give up their rooms to the ladies because the rooms have wonderful views.  Lucy learns a lot in Italy about herself and upon returning home becomes engaged to Cecil Vyse.  The Emersons and Cecil have dramatic effects upon Lucy's life after she returns home.  She discovers conflicting love within her life, and she learns that home is a lot less perfect than she had always pictured it to be.  Lucy observes that ". . . even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about-religion-was fading like all other things."  Lucy struggles to find out who she is, what she wants, and if the rules of society are to be followed in all aspects of her own life.  Lucy finally discovers her beliefs and decides whether or not to follow the trends and manners of society. I would rate this book relatively highly.  It is only two hundred and thirty pages long, but the language is difficult.  It is a good book because the reader can relate to the characters and because it is a romance, which most girls like to read.  However, there is quite a bit of philosophy, which makes it hard to understand and it is written in the language style of the nineteenth century.  I had to read some of the paragraphs multiple times to grasp their meaning.  Wrestling with the language is a good vocabulary and thinking exercise, however.  A Room with a View is a good novel to read, but the language makes it a lengthy and difficult book to understand 
 Ellis' book makes the life of Washington come alive.  The narration on the CD is well done.  Worth your time 
 As an art student studying the techniques of the masters, this little book has been invaluable to me. This is for anyone who seriously wants to experience Manet's genius. His little florals leap off the page! The printing is good, too. Faithfully shows detail and tone well. While nothing replaces seeing these works in person, this book is one every artist should have 
 Once again, I have enjoyed a beautiful BBC period drama based on a classic novel.  George Eliot's Daniel Deronda tells the story of Daniel (Hugh Dancy), an honorable young man who believes himself to be the illegitimate son of an aristocrat.  Sparks fly between him and the beautiful, adventurous and spirited gambler Gwendolen Harleth (Ramola Garai) when he gives her back the turquoise jewelry she forced herself to sell in order to cover her gambling expenses.  Attraction ensues between them, but things get in the way.  In an effort to save her family from poverty and keep herself from turning into a governess, Gwen marries the controlling, cold-hearted Henleigh Grandcourt (Hugh Bonneville)  in spite of knowing about his horrid treatment of his mistress and illegitimate children.  Her marriage is a horrible one, for Grandcourt is determined to break her spirit. And Daniel Deronda's life isn't the same when he rescues a young Jewess (Jodhi May) from a suicide attempt.  As he searches for the girl's family, he is forced to learn things about his own parentage and experiences self-discovery.  This production, like all BBC productions I've seen, is gorgeous in every possible way.  The costumes, the setting, scenery and acting are top notch.  The backdrop of London society and the Jewish community in England during the mid 1870s are quite insightful.  This miniseries centers more on the characters and their route to discover themselves more than anything else, which is quite refreshing. I knew I was into something wonderful when I noticed that Andrew Davies (Pride and Prejudice '95, Wives and Daughters, Bridget Jones's Diary) had adapted this story.  The acting is also great.  Hugh Bonneville stands out the most as the villain.  There were times that he didn't have to say a word to convey his hateful presence.  I am impressed with this actor.  He had a small role in the movie Notting Hill and I had no idea how talented he was until now.  The dark and handsome Hugh Dancy is also great as Daniel Deronda and Ramola Garai brought Gwendolen to life in more ways than one.  She gave the bratty, selfish heroine much depth and complexity.  She is also quite a beautiful actress who kind of reminded me of Cameron Diaz.  As for the story, I enjoyed it very much, but I don't like the ending.  I began to read the novel years ago but never finished it, so I have no idea how the novel ends, but the series ending left a lot to be desired simply because I felt there was more chemistry between Daniel and the third part of the love triangle than with the one he supposedly loved.  I felt no spark between them and they seemed more like friends than anything else. So their ending up together caught me by surprise.  Alas, I nevertheless enjoyed this wonderful period piece.  The DVD quality is quite good too. I recommend this beautiful, albeit short (only three episodes) BBC miniseries 
 Of course... it's still not the same as reading the book..... But as far as Audio Books go, it was wonderful! I love this story!!!! 
 I first heard this album on vinyl and I couldn't help but think to myself could this be one of Jeff Beck's greatest works ever? The reason for asking is because that it's not only Beck's pyrotechnic guitar work that's the biggest highlight of the album but musos Jan Hammer(who would go on to score two hit instrumentals, THEME FROM MIAMI VICE and CROCKETT'S THEME) and Simon Phillips(who would join Toto) contribute on keyboards/synths and drums respectively, and contribute they do! Anyway, one of Beck's greatest works? To be frank, you be the judge 
 As both a cynic and a son of the American West, I appreciated this book more than some people would. It has the further virtue of being short. It could be set anywhere in rural America, as long as there were some Native Americans nearby.  This was the summer reading assigned by one of my student's teachers. I think it's excellent for that purpose, introducing young adults to adult realities from the point-of-view of a gradually disillusioned child narrator. The book is not overly difficult, but it is challenging enough to be worthwhile to students.   Comparisons to Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" are apt, though Lee's classic is definitely more entertaining, and includes many more issues, many more points of view, much more depth and complexity. "Montana 1948" will never be a classic on that level, but it is a fine book to read, and very fine for students 
 This book is absolutely brilliant. It is a transcript of the conversations of Joseph Cambell and Bill Moyers. It is a fairly easy read, yet the ideas and genius of Campbell are ingenius and transformative. Reading this book, it brought to life the meaning and magic of myths and stories. I would recommend this book to everyone. Every person will walk away from reading this with something incredibly valuable. 
 Fred Wesley is "THE MAN". Here is a musical funk legend who has really paid his dues. He was the glue that kept the Funk going strong despite of James legendary (and at times... annoying-as-hell) super-ego and his abusive (mental, emotional, and sometimes physical) tyranny ways that interferred with the indivdual creative freedom of the most talented musicians the God has ever put on earth.  James invented Funk which I'm not taking away from him, but he definitely didn't do it on his own (thanks to the talented musicians of Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker, Alfred 'Pee Wee" Ellis, St Clair Pinckney, Waymon Reed, Richard 'Kush' Griffin, Jimmy Nolen, Al 'Country' Kellum, Clyde Stubblefield, John 'Jabo' Starks, Melvin Parker, Fillyau Clayton, Bootsy and Phelp Collins, Bernard Odum, Sweet Charles Sherrell, Johnny Griggs; the talented singers of Marva Whitney, Vicki Anderson, and the late great Lyn Collins; last but definitely not the least, I can't forget Bobby Byrd because if not for him, James life would have taking a bleaker turn since Byrd and his family not only helped James get on parole from his stint in prison, but got James into Byrd's gospel group which he later became the frontman of and would led him to becoming the well-known legend that he is today. There are other James Brown musicians names that I can't remember but had a major influential impact on builting the structural foundation on the sound we now know as 'Funk'.  I know the list was long but these singers and musicians deserve far more credit than what they're getting now since some of the musicians have already passed away while not getting their proper dues that James was (please forgive me...) too egotistically selfish and arrogant to do so which upset me deeply (I'm sorry James, I tried to hold it in since I have alot of respect for you but somebody had to give you a reality check). Had James at least shown some respect, appreciation, a little more recognition they more than deserved, and mostly important, knew how to at least control his ego, he and the rest of the band could have easily overthrown the 'Motown Dynasty'.  Anyway, this book honestly puts everything on the table with his experiences as a professional musician as well as how shady the music industry really is 
 Dray's account, while often disturbing reading, is an essential for anyone who seeks to understand the lynching phenomenon in the United States. Scholarly, but accessible, the history's gruesome recountings of lynchings are balanced by the tales of those individuals and organizations that fought, often at great personal peril, to bring an end to this national disgrace. This meticulously researched volume is recommended for the professional as well as the lay historian. It is a cautionary tale, but ultimately one not without hope.    
 My 2 year old won't leave home without this book.  He amazes me everyday with the new things he can say just by reading this book.  He has memorized where "goldbug" is on every page.  It is a must have in any library!! 
 This book is an excellent tool for gaining an understanding the broad  implications of color's effects on humans.  It deals with everything from  the scientific to the mystic.  It is well organized and easy to understand 
 The Dark Tournament is drawing to a close. Toguro has powered up to 100%, and is disappointed that Yusuke can't compete with his awesome power. He begins sucking the souls from audience members, hoping to anger Yusuke, but it doesn't do much. There is only one thing left to do. Toguro takes the life of one of Yusuke's friends. Now, Yusuke is enraged. He doesn't know what to do. He begins to blame himself for the loss. He powers up and attacks.. 
 If you do, READ THIS BOOK!  A friend of mine who hasfibromyalgia introduced me to Dr. Gerson's book.  I also havefibromyalgia.  Ten months ago, I thought I was going to die.  I was sosick that I couldn't work, I could barely take care of myself and Ihad to give away most of my possessions to move half way across thecountry to stay with family.  Now, I'm feeling much better and my lifehas improved dramatically.  Much of my progress stems from the thingsI learned from this book as well as my WILLINGNESS to implement them.I highly recommend this book!.. 
 i remember i used to chill on the block and bump this cd all day, reminds me of the old times.  kriss kross delivered dope lyrics over tight beats!  this is a must have for any fan of real hip hop 
 The book I ordered was in great condition.  It arrived extremely quickly after I ordered it.  I was very satisfied with my purchase - overall a great transaction 
 I think is a "must" for any beginner, for a low price you can have almost all the different size of EP. Try them for a few months and then when you will be completely sure what do you want and buy the EP that you need.  
 This is KE at their finest.  The songs on this album carry a meaning which is a welcome change from CDs that just babble on and on about nothing but blood and dying and the grave.  Jesse's vocals are better than Howard's in my opinion.  It's too bad Jesse left the band and started a band called Seemless, who aren't even that good.  The best songs on this disc are Fixation on the Darkness, My Last Serenade, and Life to Lifeless.  
 This was issued under the Long Now Project, with which Brian Eno is very involved. In fact, the monies raised through this cd go straight to that foundation. It is a series of different bells, with an explanation provided in the insert as to the tonal differences and how bell sounds have developed over the centuries. This lines up well with the fractals and loop projects with which Eno has been involved in the past, as he studies the points of intersection and variations/differences as the sounds progress. Not really ambient but the kind of sounds that don't dominate a given setting. Would expect to hear this in a museum or performance art setting. Recommended, if not only for being so unusual.    
 This is such a cute, humorous and honest story; a very entertaining and easy read. 
 Jug was a class act with a heart as big as his physical size and tone.  Chicagoans greeted him like a war hero on the two occasions he appeared just after doing time at Joliet-- the second an especially cruel and unfair sentence of seven years for a parole violation. Because he usually followed Sonny Stitt--the "most perfect" of all players--in their tenor battles, he had the advantage of playing to low expectations--and he rarely failed to rise to the occasion. In fact, just being able to match Stitt was sufficient to assure a victory.   Stitt, the saxophonist most identified with Charlie Parker and reputed to have been bequeathed the "keys to the kingdom" by Bird himself, would seem to outmatch Ammons.  But those listeners with longer memories or inclined to do a bit of research would know better than to underestimate Jug, the son of the highly regarded Kansas City boogie woogie pianist, Albert Ammons.  Gene was still in his teens when Billy Eckstein hired him to sit next to Dexter Gordon in the same big band that included Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Kenny Dorham, and Fats Navarro, not to mention Charlie Parker, Sonny Stitt, Wardell Gray, Art Blakey and Sarah Vaughan! At the end of his sets in the late '60s and early '70s, Jug used to love running down the line-up for his audience, all of it building up to his dramatic punch-line: "And what were all of these musical geniuses doing night after night?" (Pause) "Holding whole notes while Mr. B was balladeering on his hit songs, "I Apologize," "I Want to Talk About You," and "I'm Just a Prisoner of Love." (Pause) Who was a prisoner?"   The present RVG remaster captures Ammons at an optimal time. Following his last stay at Joliet, Jug would be greeted by a musical scene radically different from the one that he had left--Coltrane, Hendrix, Joplin not to mention the Beatles and Stones had reshaped the sonic environment he was accustomed to. Unfortunately, Ammons tried to adjust with uncharacteristic altissimo shrieking and forced elocution leading to unmistakable intonation problems. But Boss Tenor, recorded in 1960 and with the supremely gifted, exquisitely tasteful Tommy Flanagan on piano, finds Ammons with nothing to prove and doing what he did best--creating beautiful, heart-felt yet logically-constructed melodies and producing a sound that for many listeners has never been equaled--big but never "hard," simple and slightly raw but too lyrical and personal to be mistaken for R&B.  True, it was gospel and blues-derived but free of any Motown shine and polish.  Recently I read a review crediting Ammons with inspiring R&B sounds of pop saxophonists like Junior Walker.  If there's any question about the difference between a Junior Walker and a Gene Ammons, go directly to "My Romance," more full-bodied and sensual but no less sensitive than Bill Evans' version on the original Vanguard sessions. Ammons takes the tune through once, entrusting Richard Rodgers' poetic melody to the breathstream of the tenor's seductive voice, as reassuring as it is alluring.  In short, it's as good a sound as the tenor saxophone is capable of producing.  So, too, in a battle of tough tenors Ammons could play one note for the hundreds spewed forth by a Sonny Stitt or Johnny Griffin.  Invariably, it was the right note 
 This isn't the last and only history of America you'll ever read or need.  This is an addition to other texts, an important missing element in our collective education.  History used to be told from the point of view of the winners, of the uplifted, and of the heroes.  That is no longer the case and we can thank Howard Zinn and this seminal work for that.  What makes People's History of the United States different is that it's forward with its bias - this is told from the p.o.v. of the downtrodden and embattled of society and it tells of their heroes who weren't battlefield generals or blue-blood presidents, but instead they worked in factories or toiled fields or attended town-square protests.  This book is leftist, sure, but within its pages you'll find that other history, official versions of history, are slanted the other way, rightist, or rather 'might makes right'ist.    To hate this book is to ignore its scholarship and message in favor of one's own idealogical bias.  Don't you think that we need to incorporate all sides into our education so that an informed decision and position arises free of the shackles of ignorance?  I do.  Howard Zinn does.  This book isn't anti-American or unpatriotic, but instead it is the embodiment of all that is American and patriotic because here we are able to look at our nation and ourselves with a critical eye toward constant improvement and we are able to recognize what is right and what isn't and move forward always taking the best we have to offer, while abandoning the worst.  At least that's the theory.  This book is a permanent part of my reference library and represents the important scholarship being pursued in a nation of freedoms.   - CV Ric 
 Wendy Pfeffer has a talent for making difficult science concepts understandable to young children.  This is a lively and very kid-friendly book with cheerful illustrations that kids will enjoy and learn from 
 I read this book when I was in 4th grade in 1993 and 14 years later, I was searching for this book for my classroom because I remember how much I loved it.  This book pre-dates Harry Potter by several years, and I've been trying to find this particular book because it enchanted me when I read it in my teacher's library.  I would definitely suggest this book because it has everything the HP series has (if you like that), but is unique and well written.  Certainly worth a try.  
 I began reading this book with trepidation, because I worried that a book about the Marines and basketball might be a little too masculine and juvenile even for someone who tends to enjoy books with that character, but I was pleasantly mistaken. This is a great book--not just good, but great--about a career Marine who has established himself as a hero in war, leader within the Corps and one of the most bombastic, foul mouthed and party-hearty personalities anywhere, but a man who has no idea how to alter his personality at home. His family, which dutifully follows him around the South, admires his professional abilities and follows his orders almost without question also live in terror of the man who rules with an iron fist and absues them emotionally and physically. Bull Meecham is truly one of the great characters and personalities from any fiction I've read.  The other members of the family, however, are also just as valuable and interesting in this book. Bull's son's attempts to be a man, his wife's attempts to rear her children with Southern charm and grace despite their father, the oldest daughter's attempts to be an independent woman despite both of her parents. The Great Santini goes further, however, and explores racism in the mid-century South, the power of sports in youth culture, the troubled existence of military families, etc.   Pat Conroy is a beautiful writer who creates lifelike characters, produces huge laughs and equally large tragedies, and never lets a dull moment slip into this book. This is one of my favorite books I've ever read and will highly recommend it to anyone I meet. 
 The Ries's really knock ad agencies and advertising in general to make their point... one also gets a sense that they aren't happy that some clients did not listen to them.   Definitely a worthwhile read for any one interested in marketing 
 One of the most important parts of a reliable model railroad is the unseen benchwork that underlies it. This book is an excellent introduction into how that benchwork is built. It covers several different styles and shows how they can be integrated together, each doing what it does best.  It is a good introduction and all that most people will ever need but I like Linn Wescott's book on the same subject better. 
 A wonderful and thoughtful book by the author on his master, T.T. Liang. Reminds me of my Shifu, Mr. Chiang, who also spent time studying with one of TT Liang's teachers, Hsiung Yang-Ho. I highly recommend this to all Taiji players out there, whether just starting out or a seasoned student/teacher 
 Gulley Jimson (Alec Guinness), an artist, has just been released from prison and he does not waste any time to begin painting again. However, painting is not a vocation that pays the bills unless you have someone who buys your paintings.  Mr. Jimson is fully aware of the monetary difficulty for an artist, but it does not concern him.  After an incident with a previous buyer, he meets the Beeder's who want to buy a painting from him.  Somehow the Beeder's get more than what they asked for. Horse's Mouth is a light-hearted trip into the philosophy of an artist 
 It is closing time at a New York Museum. Two brothers are lost in the long corridors and hallways of the big museum. They find a stair case leading to the dark subbasement. One boy pleads not to go down, but the other says  that they are going. Then they go down, not knowing they will never return.   This is a very good and very intense. If you are into horror and suspense,  read it! It is not for the squemish, and it is very long read. It is told  in such detail that you feel you are in the story. The movie and book have  no compare, the book rocks, and is the best read i ever read 
 My mother had came in on part of the movie when my son made a comment. He shared how he really enjoyed the movie and would be a great addition to the martial arts collection. He was right.Van Damme is truly more human in this role.  I recommend this to anyone looking for action and drama, Van Damme style 
 This book launched a whole subgenre--fantasy books in which a group of three to five children (usually mixed gender) cross the boundry between the everyday world into the world of fantasy. It is the inspiration behind CS Lewis's Narnia books, Edward Eager's books, and generations of more recent novels. And it happens to be a wonderful read! My eight-year-old adored it--she's a huge Harry Potter fan (another series in Nesbit's debt) and thought this one was fabulous, though the Victorian language did slow her down a little 
 We had ordered this product as a retirment present for a co-worker who was leaving in about a week so we even had Fed Ex shipping.  The product kept showing up as in Order Status & never updated until almost a week later when it was delivered.  Product arrived in excellent condition but we were wondering if it was ever shipped...Amazon or Retailer needs to update shipping info instead of leaving product showing Order status & not shipped 
 I've always felt young at heart even after turning 52..but never knew the ins and out of finding and keeping romance. Tom Blake recommended I read, "Young at Heart." This book is Great! I've read it once, twice, and now again so that the messages become ingrained and spontanious.I can't beleive how nieve and stupid I've been about my relationships with men. So many errors and mistakes. If you're a single, divorced or widow woman approaching 50 or 50+ you've gotta read this book! Keep it near your nite table for review. Dr. Zukerman Thanks a million for writing a book that women "redating again for the first time can truely use!" "This book gets a 10+ from me.&quot 
 I've been a bible-believing, born-again Christian for more than fifty years. I've got exactly one test for deciding on whether to listen to a preacher - is it scripturaly based. Joel cites scripture for every point he makes. If you're looking for someone to preach hellfire, brimstone and the evil in man, he's probably not for you. If you're looking for someone to reaffirm the Good News and its place in your day to day life, Joel may be a conduit through which God can speak to your heart.  I've never heard Joel say that if you do right, you're going to have material things. I've obviously missed that sermon. I have heard him say to be happy with what God gives you. I have heard him say that travail is only a test and is to be counted to joy. I have heard him say to stop listening to condemnation and claim your birthright as a child of God. I have heard him say to be kind to others, be encouraging to your family, and to be gentle with yourself. Listening to Joel is a joy to me as it helps me discard some of the legalism and condemnation that I had built into what was an endlessly playing record that I was no good. I have learned to accept myself more because of Joel. It had been hard for me to be a better Christian because of my poor self-image. It was hard to accept tht God loved me, every single day, even when I failed, when I didn't love myself. By learning to accept myself the way that God accepts me, it grew natural to love myself more and, oddly, love others more as well. I grew more accepting (as Jesus was), more understanding (as Jesus was), and more giving (as Jesus was). Yes, God could have freed my heart without Joel. But I am not audacious enough to try to limit God on how he chooses to teach me.  My life has improved in a thousand ways since I opened my heart to a belief to a positive, fulfilled walk with the Lord, including financially. But, the financial ways are the LEAST of what I got out of it. It's possible that I have less income that I consider to be mine. Oddly, as my income increased, I found new ways to share more of it with others. But I doubt it. I truly believe that God finds ways to provide more for me than I can ever give away. God, not Joel. Would I have passed the test about what to do with new finances if it hadn't been for Joel helping me to see how I fit in as a child of the King? Maybe. Maybe not. I was pretty comfortable with the old me that only wanted more.  If it bothers you that Joel teaches you to be positive, you might want to examine Jesus words. He was full of positivism. So was Paul. Neither was well off financially but both were wealthy beyound the dreams of men.   I didn't write this to tell you how great I am. Or even how great Joel is. I wrote this because my God, My Lord is the original Positivist! Because believing in the two great commandments isn't wrong. Because sin is to be overcome, not wallowed in. If it's wrong for me to praise God for helping me to pass a few of the old tests and feel good about facing new ones with the positive attitude of a victor, then I'll just stand on the Word and wait to be judged by the only One who can.  If you think you're no good, buy this book. If you believe you're a failure, if you hurt because of past slings and arrows, buy this book. If you say you're a Christian but can't quite practice it in day to day life, buy this book. I will never be sorry that I did.  I apologize for the length of this review 
 624 pages packed with the best of the best! It's like having all of your best friends at one party! Guaranteed sleepless nights. This book is a must for anyone who enjoys good horror. I also recommend, Steward's--"Tales  of Dirt, Danger, and Darkness" a new fresh, up and coming author 
 What can I say I love this movie, it has open my eyes about life in the streets and life as a whole. Its a hardcore movie, you get a message throughout the whole movie. The best part that I can say it was when DMX was going to shoot the muslim man. muslim man talked to DMX and opened his eyes about life. Thats I feel now about life..... 
 While Philip Pullman is working on the Book of Dust, the new novel set in Lyra's world, this short story may help to ease the pain of all the readers who are desperately needing a Lyra fix.  You should not expect anything other than a short story: it's well written, makes certain small scale revelations about Lyra's fate and hints to the new developments in her life, but overall this is more of a beautifully designed coffee book, rather than a full scale work. As long as you are willing to accept this fact, you will be very happy with Lyra's Oxford. The insert with maps, list of books and catalogues and many other treasures is very interesting, and I am glad I got this little red book for myself- and it would certainly make a great gift for any Pullman fans 
 This is a great book.  Helps to give insight for yourself as well as those you manage.  It helps give creedence to having your own style and that company success isn't dependent upon a formula for sales but working with individual style and strength for success and employee satisfaction 
 While this story may be longer and more complicated for the small child, the illustrations are magnificent! I suggest reading it over the course of a few nights at bedtime and let your children enjoy the magic 
 I bought this book for my girlfriend and she said that if she didn't have it she never would have passed some of her college classes last quarter 
 If you are a fan of the Tick, then this is a good video for you.  There are 36 episodes of the Tick all told, though, and this one is in the bottom 25%.  Of course, there are only 2 The Tick videos released, this one and The Tick vs. The Idea Men.  If you are looking for the other 34 episodes I'd recommend writing Comedy Central and complaining or downloading them from Gnutella 
 Julio Cortazar is a revolutionary but one far from home and not a political revolutionary but one that roams the further reaches of the psyche, just beyond where civilization says it is safe to go. Every single one of his many short stories is worth reading(so, if available, get all of them). His novels I find too experimental and mired in his theories but in the short story he shines like very few others. Some of his best are told through a childs perspective and all of his shorter fictions in a way take you into that kind of place where wonder still outweighs any learned way of seeing "reality" which in Cortazar is always in quotes. Cortazar likes to take you out of your normal context and give you a whole new set of associations, a whole new world to walk in. His novels are difficult but his stories are not. They invite the best kinds of speculation but they can also be appreciated at a glance. Cortazar is reputed to have had a very large record collection, mostly jazz, in his Paris lair in the sixties. I think he is one of those authors who would have been very interesting to know. Hip to the way peoples perception of the world were changing at the time, but persistent in his personal quests which led him down many strange avenues. To this his stories will attest. A note: Cortazar is sometimes grouped in with Borges and there are some good reasons why but I prefer Cortazar. Both play games with logic but Cortazar pleases both the mind and the emotions. The effect is more subtle 
 Terrific easy to read peek inside this bestselling author's world.  The book doesn't go into oceans of detail about something that I've always been curious about: Specifically how she wrote before she developed her current style, and what influenced her back then.  Collaboration by friend and daughter are helpful in rounding it out.  Great read overall 
 "Moonlight" is my favorite song on this record that is full of my favorite Bob Dylan songs. Just imagine a honky tonking riverboat gambler with a guitar and a touch of irony in his voice and you have the master who comes up with such words, like "Doctor, lawyer indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief, and who does the bell toll for, love, it tolls for you and me." Old words mingled with new words which captures the essence of this album, old style infused with a touch of today. Still, I imagine someone fifty or sixty years ago, hearing this record for the first time, from the whimsical" Tweedle Dee" to the dirge like "Sugar Baby" that is so reminiscent of "Dark Eyes" the song that closes "Empire Burlesque, would recognize Bob Dylan as a contemporary. "Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love's not an evil thing." What great lyrics there are on this record you'll never be able to get out of your mind. "It takes a thief to catch a thief," and Bob Dylan must be a thief, because he sure caught me 
 Best book I ever read.  No favorite colors, films, songs, artists, authors, weather patterns in my life - but one book I'll call the best, the favorite.  Twenty-five to thirty years ago I read it over and over again until it's eventual disintegration from use and from its own weight.  I still have yellowed clips of paragraphs, retyped (on an IBM Selectric, thank you) and carried in pocket or purse to remind me to change my angle of observation from time to time.  Plenty of reviews here to tell you the story, I'm just here to praise it. 
 "100 Events" might better be titled, "100 20th century mostly-American events that LIFE has pictures of."  Nothing wrong with that of course, but it would make for a more accurate title.  The book unfolds in classic LIFE format, with full page and double-page layouts of famous events. Some are truly momentous and have potential world-wide historical impact. The discovery of the structure of DNA will affect the way human beings heal, diagnose and even propagate. Dr. Christian Barnard's first heart transplant in 1967 also changed the way we see the human body - less as a unity than as an array of interchangeable parts. The dropping of the atomic bomb dramatically changed the nature of warfare and the way that all nations must learn to relate. And the walk on the moon in 1969 was a technical achievement that truly did astound the world and perhaps even paved the way for an end to the Cold War.  But Marilyn Monroe modeling a bikini? The Yankees acquiring Babe Ruth? Louis Armstrong? Madonna? The U2 Incident? Even the 1969 Woodstock music festival is a questionable choice.  Whatever.  The pictures are fun to look at. The events may spur debate. Which 100 would you choose? LIFE could have done worse. 
 This movie is about a boy who gets badly insulted at a school dance in Junior High he ended up getting beaten up by a bunch of macho boys and all the popular girls who asked him to dance are all forgiven and there isnt any consequences.  Many years later they all become succesfull people struggling with work and relationships. When one of the friends turns up murdered at the hospital where she works they start to think that the boy that they insulted as come back to get them. They dont remember what happened to him and have no idea to what he looks like. Denise Richards, Marley Shelton, Jessica Cauffell, Jessica Caupshaw, David Boreanaz, and Katherine Heigl star in this terrifying movie. The good thing is you get to see Denise Richards character Paige Prescott in a bikini. Soon the killer starts attacking all of the girls in a mask in bizarre places. For example in a jacuzzi at the spa, in a morgue while doing an autopsy, in an art gallery when taking a quick break. The deaths are pretty vile and brutal there is lots and lots of blood spilled everywhere you can tell this movie was filmed very quickly and rushed into release. The attack of the killer is very predictable and there is only one twist at the end when Marley Sheltons character finds out that her boyfriend Played by David Boreanaz was the one who was behind all the masked killings even though she was friends with them he let her live because she didnt hurt his feelings at the dance. Denise Richards character bites the dust hard i believe its after the art show when she goes to take a bath in the jacuzzi the killer attacks her with a nail gun and tries to suffocate her she shows a lot of ressistance to the killings but he still shows no mercy the nail goes right into her shoulder and then finally the kille throws the gun into the water which electrocutes her. It was very scary. But the movie itself isnt scary it wasnt as bad as Urban Legends: Final Cut or I still know what you did last summer. It was still a very good movie over all. This is not a movie to watch on Valentines day its a movie to watch around Halloween and isnt really meant for kids below 14. This is a teen slasher flick but it is indeed violent and it can easily scare people. Parents trust the R rating on the back and dont let them watch it. Its mainly for adults to laugh over. The weird thing is that Denise Richards was listed first on the credit line up and she was 3rd to last to get killed. It was bizarre. But still this movie was really good and not really scary it was like a freaky sho 
 I have just finished this book and keep thinking about it.  It's a real adventure, with a pair of wonderful brother and sister characters whose journey was so touching and real.  I rate this book up with the Four Gated City and the Children of Violence series.  It's just a great, totally relevant story, especially considering issues of civilization, climate change, and progress.  Read it 
 I was lucky enough to live in a town when I was a kid that had a great radio station.  No top 40, just great music.  Exposed me to a lot of music that nobody else played.  I was lucky enough to hear songs off of this album, bought it when it first came out, and then saw him in concert!  He was great, and I was amazed that he was playing a cheap banged-up Harmony guitar, just like I had bought at Sears for about $50 (yeah, you could buy guitars at Sears back then).  I saw him on a concert tape or tv years later, and he was still playing that old guitar.    Just saw him on the "Crossroads Guitar Festival" DVD.  I would get this album and that DVD.  
 The begining of the book is a bit slow, when the author is introducing the characters, but once that is done hang on to your seat.  This is a very exciting story line.  I definatly recommend this book to those that like a book you cant put down 
 This album is really good. I recomend it to any Soul Asylum fan. But some one who is not, I dont think they would like it to much. However I really enjoyed this album 
 The work of hotel design and planning is different from other architectural works; it requires an indepth understanding of hotel business. Therefore, the hotel architecture became one of the toughest job for architects. (Another job is the hospital architecture.)  However, this book proposed design guidelines for a hotel fit to the business pattern. First, it explains various types of hotel properties. Second, it shows not only design guidelines for facilities but also planning approach methods for location selecting and size determination. Finally, if you read this book, you can consider efficient management system of the property from the early phase of design.  Among numerous books on hotel architecture, I think this book is the most outstanding resource 
 Very practical and very readable.  Not at all pedantic.  Chapters are generally short, but packed with information.  Book is being used as a text in a Writer's Digest class.  Section breakdown by number of chapters: The craft (9), The art (8), The process (8), The genres (9), The marketplace (7), plus 14 interviews with current writers.  The book is great, but surprisingly, it contains more than a few typos and grammatical errors 
 Kubler-Ross teaches us how to understand the death of a family member or loved one and how to cherish the final moments with them 
 This movie has some ladies in it that I really like...Alexis Bledel and America Ferrara, so I decided to give it a try.  The storyline is about a pair of "magic" jeans  that are shared by the group...and of all the things that happen to them while they have the jeans in their possession.  Of course, it IS rather unbelievable, and is totally fiction, but it does render a smile or two.  It's definitely a "chick flick" but it is a good one for friends and sisters to watch together!  Pop some popcorn, pop in this movie,  get your Ya-Yas together, and enjoy 
 Children of the River, by Linda Crew, is an excellent book. It illustrates the numerous ways that cultural differences influence the lifestyles of many people in the U.S. It tells the story of Sundara, a young girl from Cambodia, who flees to the U.S. escaping the violence and chaos of her home country. She must leave behind her family, her brother and sister, and her childhood sweetheart, Chamroeun. In America, she meets an American boy, Jonathan, who accepts and embraces her cultural differences. Sundara must struggle with keeping true to her Cambodian way of life, and the grief of not knowing whether or not her family is still alive. It is a moving story that I enjoyed reading and definitely recommend. 
 I'm always amazed by "reviewers" who want to brush aside unpleasant news by calling the truth "partisan smear".  This book had me at the outset and I appreciated the long quotations from personal letters, citations from the public record, and yes, friends and family, including "blind" quotes that have the ring of truth 
 A hasty Hare relentlessly bullies a shy Tortoise, "By the time you finish picking those spring flowers it will be winter . . . By the time you get there, the stores will be closed."  A reluctant Tortoise (pulling his head inside his shell) is encouraged by his friends to accept Hare's challenge to a race and they help him get in shape.  Tortoise maintains his pace while Hare races ahead.  Indulging in a series of breaks that include snacks, the overconfident Hare falls asleep and is awakened from a dream of his victory to find the crowd cheering for his opponent.    
 This is an excellent portrayal of the Enron fiasco. It utilizes footage and sound bites, and interviews, it's absolutely amazing what happened! This film is a must see for everyone 
 What a great guide. Rick Steve's told me so many chill, off the beaten path things to do in London and then I picked up my Party London & Paris guidebook and hand the most fun and social days and nights. What a great combination of books.  I can't wait to go back 
 Like film awards, book awards rarely go to an artist's best work.  Usually if a picture book has won a Caldecott medal you can sift through the author and illustrator's other books and inevitably find something far more deserving.  This is true of almost every author/illustrator, save one.  Ed Young has had a varied and fabulous career.  From his spectacular "Seven Blind Mice" to his insipid and poorly drawn "Turkey Girl" he's run the gamut from "Yippee!" to "Bleach!".  But his Caldecott winning "Lon Po Po" falls squarely into the "Yippee!" category.  To my mind, it is his best work.  A stunning edition of the Chinese tale of Lon Po Po, this story weaves elements of Grimm Fairy Tales with "Little Red Riding Hood" and comes out swinging. 	 One day a mother leaves her three daughters to visit their grandmother on her birthday.  Before she leaves she instructs the girls to lock the doors soundly after she is gone.  The girls do so but a wily wolf has overheard that the mother will be leaving.  The wolf disguises himself as an old woman and knocks on the door.  When asked who he is, he responds that he is their grandmother (or "Po Po") come to stay with them.  The children foolishly let the animal in and he quickly douses the lights.  After many questions about the supposed grandmother's bushy tail and sharp claws the eldest and cleverest daughter catches sight of the wolf's snout and must find a way to save her sisters.  Not only does she succeed, but she also finds a way to get rid of the wolf forever. 	 In the dedication of this book, Ed Young writes, "To all the wolves of the world for lending their good name as a tangible symbol for our darkness".  This was written in part, I suspect, to appease the wolf lovers of the world.  Much like the old fairy tales of European folklore, this tale has its fair share of violence.  The wolf's end, for example, is a particularly nasty way to go.  And because it has been created so realistically in this book, I suspect that there are probably some animal advocates who will take offense at his death.  Nonetheless, we're not dealing with reality here, people.  We're dealing with fairy tales and in these stories wolves are (as Young himself said) representative of our own evil. 	 The story is translated by Young himself and is done beautifully.  The words in this tale sing.  Yet even the best laid plotting can be undone by poor illustrations.  In this particular case, you've nothing to fear because Young has bent over backwards to bring you absolute breathtaking beauty.  Combining watercolors with pastels, the book is simultaneously gorgeous and frightening.  It may take a couple readings, but if you look carefully in some of these pictures you will find wolf images hidden in the landscapes and backgrounds of a great many scenes.  The first spread in this book is of the mother leaving her children.  As she goes, the land beneath her feet is shaped like that of a wolf's nose, the cottage the eye of the animal.  Often the pictures are separated into threes, giving the book a formal feeling.  Finally, the pictures of the girls and their enemy are excellent.  Sometimes the merest of glimpses of the wolf are scary enough to drill home what a threat he is.  You really do feel scared for the children when they cuddle up with their supposed grandmother in bed, only to find her to be a hungry beastie. 	 The "Little Red Riding Hood" story is all well and good in and of itself, but it always lacked kick.  "Lon Po Po" has more than kick.  It has bite.  It will enrapture small children and give them tangible forms for their darkest fears.  It will hypnotize any reader, drawing them effortlessly into its deeply interesting story.  Of all the Caldecott winning picture books of the last 15 years, this one is my favorite, hands down.  
 VERY sad, i cannot believe the jury gave Jason what they did. I do think Jason could have left though. He WAS over 18, i mean killing her was stupid in my opinion. I think the DA could have been a little more understanding, all of his abuse history was barely even brought up in the trial and his lawyer well sucked, i kept thinking of things i would have said if i was his lawyer!  Anyway's this book is an addicting read and you won't put it down 
 this is one of my favorites in this genre, lit adaptations. Hannah Taylor-Gordon is superb, the story is a great lesson, and the locations really fine. 
 While I have not yet built any of the birdhouses found within this book, some of the design concepts are excellent!  I've got to build some of these birdhouses!!!  A truly unique castle-type birdhouse is found within this book......eye-catching indeed!  I like how the book explains that what's attractive for humans isn't always so terribly appealing for birds......wherein the author proceeds to provide plans for "plain" birdhouses all the way up to cosmetically appealing birdhouses.  Worth your money 
 I attached the remote to the instrument panel of my motorcycle. The iPod is safely tucked away in a saddle bag out of the elements. No wires, no fuss, no muss. And you can't beat the price! No interference. Never had a problem 
 When this movie came out, I was twelve years old and horribly afraid of being caught out as not old enough to see a PG-13 movie without an adult. In spite of that fear however, I saw this movie no less than seven times in the theatre alone. Now at almost 23 years old, I can say that this movie still makes me giddy with enjoyment. I love Liu Kang, Raiden and especially Reptile. Annihilation didn't come close to matching this movie. They couldn't keep the actors from the first film, Johnny Cage died in the first five seconds and the actor who had replaced Christopher Lambert as Raiden was terrible. But this movie, this movie captured my imagination over and over again and will likely continue to do so 
 This is an excellent volume. The explanations and content are very clear and thorough, and the photographs are also very clear. Anyone who is prepared to pay attention should be able to see what is going on throughout. There's good coverage of basic training for strength and speed, as well as the various types (finger, wrist, muscle-grabbing, etc.) of Chin Na 
 Imitation of Christ was highly recommended to me and it did not disappoint 
 Maurizio Pollini's late 1970s film recordings of Beethoven Piano Concertos 3 and 5; Mozart Piano Concertos 19 and 23; and Brahms Piano Concerto 2 have it all: great pianism, beautiful playing by the Vienna Philharmonic, magnificent conducting by Karl Bohm (Beethoven, Mozart) and Claudio Abbado (Brahms), all adding up to one thing: a beautiful experience.  These DVDs are a feast for the ears: great audio, and the eyes: great video.  The 1970s Unitel films used in this DG release have held up very well in the vaults: there are no glitches or imperfections in the picture.  The camera work is also excellent, and serves the music being performed.  In my perception, Pollini plays all the concertos here with an Italian grace and charm, relying more on Classical elements and a "lean" approach, than a more Romantic, heavy handed approach, especially in the Beethoven and Brahms works.  I think also the sound of the Bohm-led items is slightly fuller bodied than Abbado's Brahms, but the sound in all 5 Concertos is very good.  For about $30.00, you can't go wrong with this release.  Pollini's playing is beyond reproach, and to see the Vienna Philharmonic musicians playing is wonderful, too.  There is no audience, and the recording venue:  Vienna's Musikvereien, has wonderful acoustics - one of the best concert halls in the civilized world.  It was worth alot to me to see Karl Bohm smile at Maurizio Pollini at the beginning of I, of Mozart's Piano Concerto 19 with it's humorous, scherzo like theme which begins the concerto.  Highly recommended 
 As other reviewers have pointed out, this is as much the story of New York City since the 1960s as it is of Rudy Giuliani. I ordered it to read more about the mayor since he has become a serious candidate for president. The story of the city and its problems was almost more engaging. The left liberal political culture had run the city into the ground. CUNY, the "poor man's Harvard" had collapsed into a city-wide babysitting service. Teachers who had graduated from CUNY were illiterate and were training an illiterate generation of high school "graduates." The author points out how Giuliani became aware of the magnitude of the problem when protest signs held by teachers were filled with misspellings. I also learned a lot about Al Sharpton I wish I didn't know. The fact that Giuliani was able to master this collection of anarchists and hustlers and hacks, and get things done, is a great testimonial to his talents. The errors he made are also on full display so this is not a partisan hagiography. The mayor is there, warts and all. An excellent biography of Giuliani and of the city, itself 
 I can understand the polarity of opinion about this book. And you certainly don't want to be reading Thomas Hardy while listening to Leonard Cohen. Don't dismiss the negative comments out of hand - Hardy is probably not for all tastes. In my case though, as a student disinterested in reading, this novel turned me into a reader. It has a "heavy" style, but I think it was this depth that appealed to me most - that, and the obvious devotion Hardy felt toward his beloved Wessex (strange how this passion of the author for his countryside seems to me more forcefully written than most other stories where passion is thematic). Of course I have since read all the Wessex novels but this remains my favorite, and probably my favorite novel of all. Still, not an easy recommendation 
 It is certainly THE BIBLE for construction. Boy, I sweated it! But, if you can get through it, it is certainly worth the efford 
 I am surprised that multiple reviewers have not been able to read past the second page of this book before coming online and writing a review to the extent of "SKINNER'S DAUGHTER IS ALIVE!!!" Don't you think that if you, random hokey of the world, realize that B.F. Skinner's daughter is alive, than the person writing this book would also know? Perhaps not.. But! If you continue to read past page 2, past the interview with Skinner's other daughter, past the various places where she emphasizes that both daughter's are alive and well, and that Skinner was not such a bad man, then maybe you can come to the conclusion that Slater doesn't know what she's writing about. Don't let her style of writing confuse you. She is not only writing a book on psychology but also telling a story with a personal narrative. Read past page 2 
 An extremely well-written piece by a wonderful novelist. Not only does Huxley is able to convey his mescalin-induced thoughts with pungent pervasiveness, but also sets the wheels of human curiosity into motion, as to make one wonder about the possibility of a parallel world of "infinite and divine" all around us, readily available at the touch of our fingertips. As a society, we whould be grateful to Huxley's catatonic introspections and mapping of the human psyche 
 It is not often a film brings together an excellent cast, superb story and ground breaking special effects.  This movie makes you think what really makes us human.  If we are made of flesh and bone, possess logic and function in society, we must be human.  But what if a machine has these same exact traits?  Are they human as well?  This is a great movie built from a great book while I highly recommend.  I only wish it has a bit more action 
   What Peters writes is undoubtedly correct if you want to get on in the new workplace.  If you don't have the backing of wealth and/or family ties then behaving as he suggests is probably one of the best ways of attempting not to sink to the bottom, or near bottom, of the wage heap.  However, in order to succeed by his method you have to do a little bit of self deception.  You have to pretend that the old way was bad, and that the new way is free and in the original American craft/mercantile tradition.    Peters spends quite a lot of time attacking the old way of jobs for life and workplace security as being boring and unfree, so this seems to be an important part of the technique you must apply to yourself (of branding yourself).  What he doesn't emphasise is that in the old system you had the security to be free.  You could pretty much work as you pleased, you could leave the work if you found you hated it, or it was too oppressive, and get new work reasonably easily, you could partially avoid authority because no-one cared as long as you looked like you were achieving something.  If your marriage was in trouble or your kids were ill, people would cut you some slack - you could have some kind of workplace community, mutual knowledge and mutual support.  You had unions, so you could stand together and try and make sure that you got decent wages and that not too much of your life was sacrificed to work, or workplace injury.  You and your boss might even get on with each other.  Not true in his method.  With the new workplace you have to please and appeal to your masters all the time; compete all the time, otherwise no work.  No work, no money, no record, no status, no more work.  And, of course, even though this may be the only way to work nowadays, it will not be successful for everyone anyway.  The system requires catastrophic failure to motivate success - blame it on lack of skill, lack of talent, lack of hard work, lack of work - what ever you will, it's no responsibility of the masters.   The laws will go into place to make it so, if they haven't already.  He also attacks the social security system for demoralising people.  Perhaps he has not seen too much of the demoralisation produced by starvation and no money, or perhaps he dislikes it because it did mean that people could leave their work if it was bad and look for something else.  It meant people were not desperate if they lost work or their company went bust, they could survive without having some do-gooding religious group prying into their lives.  Sure, some ingenious people used it to be free and do what they wanted, art, surf, look after their kids, set up a business, get an education, become self reliant and that is a undoubtedly a bad thing, but most people used it because they had to.  Indeed you might think that the more work becomes temporary and unstable, contracted and job to job; the more everyone might need social security, the more it might support the system.  But not if you want most people to be desperate to take anything and to be really subservient.    So this is freedom.  Sure even in slavery you could be free in this way, you could say `yessir', `yesmam' as quickly as possible.  You could be as pleasing as possible, as appealing to the whims of your masters as possible, you might become entertaining and useful, and in return you might get an ok life - you might even be allowed to breed and own something.  Peters recommends this life for us all.  So it's up to you.  Do you take Peters on board and learn to bow and curtsey, deceive yourself and be cute, or do you take up some kind of political action?  That's the only choice really. 
 the good  -it has fairly good graphics  -the franchise is very real and you can play it up to 30 seasons.   -it has a bunch of new features that madden 05 didn't like, the truck stick and nfl superstar  the bad  -once you've played this for awhile you'll realize that john madden and al micheals say the same thing every game. it get old.   -when you look into the crowd in a game, the graphics suck. it looks like a big blob of colors   overall it is a really fun game. i hope madden 07 will be better though.  
 Referred by a friend, I read this book. It immidiately attracted my attention. Through practical stories and examples, it brings the dry classic economic theory in life, yet profoundly. After I read this book, my view point get sharp to see how the business work and how to deal with the daily life. Why we struggle to make comparative advantage, how to reward the employees? This book opened my mind in my practice business world, and immediately we feel the inovative change. This is the single book mostly affected my life. A philosophy with Math principle. 
 Predident Jimmy Carter's courageous new book, "Palestine,Peace Not Apartheid" has gotten much undeserved fallout for its truthful telling of Israel's theft of Palestinian land as the basic cause of the ongoing Mideast Israel-Palestinian conflict. He is the first and only US politician of national stature to tell the truth to the American people about Israel faults. As an evangelical Christian with probably unsurpassed historical involvement and perspective on this conflict among US politicians, you might wonder why he is getting vilified for this important book. This book explains why. Read it---after Carter's book 
 Before I purchased this book, I read the other reviews and I am so glad I did!  I have purchased loads of books, magazines...anything "kitchen" and found this to be the most informative.  Everything that isn't covered in the others IS covered in this.  This is the only book you need, if you just want to look at ideas, or if you really want to KNOW what you need actually need to know.  All I can say is...you need this book if you want to be informed about a new kitchen!!!! 
 Although I am an adult, I've enjoyed all the Christy Miller stories.  Christy is the sort of person I would have loved to have had for a friend durin high school, and I think many girls can relate to her.  The pacing of the stories is sometimes a little slow, and the supporting characters, especially Christy's parents, should have been much better developed.  Still, the stories are so enjoyable they are well worth reading 
 I've never seen a book that covers more(or half as many) forms of sparring as Ultimate Sparring by Jonathan Maberry.  It's front-loaded with a lot of great information on rules, first aid, history, etc., and then moves into a style-by-style guide of sparring methods that really does cover the topic.  I'm impressed.  Very impressed 
 I picked up a copy of this book on my recent trip to Greece. In my time away, I was hoping to acquaint myself with the various works of the famous prophets.  When I found this book, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had the complete translation of Garencieres.  His original book is quite rare and considered to be an antique.  I almost managed to acquire a copy once, but it ended up going for over $5,000.  This is a historically significant translation since it is one of the earliest modern English versions.  Garencieres worked in the 1600's and couldn't slant the translation to fit modern events.  It is enjoyable to compare his work to the modern "masters" of interpretation 
 Like most people, I ridiculed Riverdance and everything of the like.  But working in a store that sold this, I was absolutely floored by how awesome Michael Flatly's Feet of Flames was.  This can not be compared to River Dance or Lord of the Dance (precurors to Feet of Flames).  This is much more a show; kind of like the difference between Cirque Du Soleil's Saltimbanco and Quidam.  The production value skyrockets and makes anything else (before it) look archaic.  Feet of Flames showcases MORE than just Celtic-style dancing.  There are musical numbers by both a female duo and a solo singer.  There IS some sort of story involved but I never focused too much on it.  The dancing is fantastic.  While the show is geared around Michael Flatly's skills, he does allow his other dancers to have some of the spotlight.    The interviews/making-of is quite insightful.  Who would have though that Flatly loses several pounds (of water/sweat) during each performance?  It's a wild show that showcases just how profitable 'riverdancing' can be.  The sheer energy of the show, the performers and even the crowd will make you want to dance along with it 
 Never let it be said that Greg Iles writes the same book twice.  The man apparently doesn't realize that once you become a bestselling author, you should find a formula and stick to it.  That's good news for his fans. I've read four of his novels so far and have enjoyed each of them for different reasons. But one thing they all have in common-they're all great.  The Quiet Game may be one of his stronger works. I admit I read Turning Angel, the follow-up novel with protagonist Penn Cage before I got to the Quiet Game. But I will give Iles credit-Turning Angel is a novel that features the same characters but doesn't ruin the ending of The Quiet Game in any way.  My reading of Turning Angel first may have made the first few chapters go a bit slower than I'd like (I already knew all the characters in play and so to meet them again for the first time wasn't exactly a page-turner). The story starts slowly, putting all the pieces into play within the first 100 or so pages. Then, it takes off. Penn Cage returns to his hometown of Natchez to help his daughter cope with the loss of her mother. And to help himself deal with it. While there, Penn starts to dig under the surface of some unresolved family issues and undercovers a powderkeg. His father is being blackmailed and when Penn resolves this, he uncovers a far more horrifying conspiracy of silence that leads all the way to the highest corridors of power in the United States. As Penn uncovers the truth, he and his family are placed in greater danger, but that only reinforces his resolve to dig deeper and solve the mysteries at the heart of the novel.  The highest compliment I can pay this novel is that in the last 100 or so pages, some revelations start to come fast and furious that could make you roll your eyes and say, "No, really, come on on!" Instead of that, Iles sets them up well and really makes them feel authentic. Iles takes what could be cliches and makes them new again.  This is a great novel, easily on par with Turning Angel. I will have to save Turning Angel is a bit better but that's only because it grabs you by the collar and doesn't let go until the final page. But the common element to both novels is Iles superlatives storytelling skills and how the novel lingers in your mind long afte the final page is turned 
 This is really the last of the Clouseau films.  The others were cobbled together after Sellers' death and are not as enjoyable.  This film is actually quite fresh and very enjoyable.  Not only are the regulars in attendance, we get to meet the people who provide Clouseau with his fabulously ridiculous disguises.  It turns out that there is a store that provides them and is owned by one Professor Auguste Balls (done to a T by the remarkable Graham Stark).  In this film, Robert Webber plays Phillipe Douvier, who is a gangster that his peers think is losing his edge.  So, he kills Clouseau as a demonstration that he is still a powerful man.  Well, everyone thinks he has killed Clouseau and that leads to most of the delightful humor in the film.  While the familiar elements of Dreyfus and Kato are here, everything is twisted pretty hard and kept fresh even though they are familiar.  We get to find out more about Kato and what he turns to once he thinks Clouseau is gone.  Amazing stuff.  Dyan Cannon, at her most stunning, plays Simone Legree (ho, ho, ho) who is Douvier's mistress / secretary.  The mighty Dourvier is afraid of his wife who demands that he end his relationship with Simone which, of course, makes Simone angry and reckless.  Douvier intends to have her killed and she is inadvertently saved by the already deceased Clouseau.  Fireworks ensue.  When you get all this plus an inflatable parrot, how can you go wrong 
 Sam Elliott at his best ... again ... and Katharine Ross is as natural to his character as one could ask for. If this couple don't form their own production company they are missing a good bet 
 Greg Garrett is a wonderful storyteller.  This journey is told with tremendous ease despite the sorrow that Clay Forrester is immersed in.  The only thing that would make this book any better is a soundtrack as a companion to the musical journey of this story.  I loved it 
 When I started reading this book, I could not put it down until I had read 219 pages; I had to force myself to go to bed in the wee hours.  I finished it the next night.  The use of extended narrative and minimal dialogue actually became quite enjoyable as I read on.  I am awarding five stars to make up for at least one one-star sourpuss review.  This is a marvelous historical novel, and it deserves five stars anyway 
 ("M.D." in this case stands for musical doctor...)  Those of us who have seen DR live know it is an experience unlike any other.  Onstage, she makes her own rules and then breaks them-- seeming to constantly reinvent her songs/voice/ musical identity, all the while maintaining an intimacy with the audience that is as easeful as it is proufound/magical.  I think that she does a number of  very radical things with her music in general, and that her particularly radical style is exemplified by her performances on stage, and here in this album.  When I say radical, I mean:  somehow during the creative process of performing, she makes the radical choice to include the listener/audience over and over again EXPLICITLY in her creation.  She has, I think, an innate and extremely rare understanding of the nexxus of human emotion and art (who else would dare put forth an album as raw and complex and contradicory as "Art and Survival'?) and is able to use her talent to make the final product far more than the sum of its parts.   She goes beyond her role and status as an entertainer, giving medicine to her audience, medicine that lives on in the human heart long after the concert is over.  Ironically, it's this, the most astounding aspect of her musicianship, that makes her most vulnerable to criticism.  Most will agree on the dazzling voice, but: one reviewer of this album called "5 Chapters"  "self-indulgent"; others have claimed she is too experimental and not a "true" jazz singer.  I, myself, referred to some songs on "Bridges" as "didactic" (see review).  It was listening to this live album that made it click: refrains "Testify" and "Mista" now are embedded in my consciousness, self-activating affirmation chants that I hold dear in times of spiritual/emotional crisis.  These songs annoyed me when I first heard them!  Now I understand what she's doing:  disobeying the sacred unspoken tenet of the European sensibility, that says we must "show but not tell" in art.  The tenet the enforces the division between the experience and the expression.  In the live world with DR, there is no division:  when she greets the audience, she's singing;  when she introduces each and every member of the band, telling stories all the way [left out on this album :(   ], she's singing; when she talks about her start in the music business, her love of singing, her family, her heart being broken, she's doing this singing-talking thing that as far as I know is completely original to her, at least to the extent that she does it.  And the singing is beautiful, and the talking is interesting-- thus, again-- more than the sum of their parts:  the synergy of her miraculous presence and talent.  Unmatched.  She's THE singer for this millenium.  I'm running out of room here but the truth is that Dianne is the queen of jazz...and the doctor of our broken hearts.  Let us praise her.. 
 A great book to remind you to stay observant of people's  actions.  This book will teach you how to persuade your customer more often to go in your direction.  It also is about staying ethical and effective.   Love this book 
 A remarkably original book. The illustrations are well wrought, and the story contains some of the most evocative I've heard in a picture book. Describing Novio Boy's collar, the book says it was, "a leather one with real gems that sparkled at night when cars passed in the street". The cats themselves are a twinge odd. Drawn with cat bodies but human eyes, teeth, and moustaches, they are just disturbing enough to keep the pictures interesting. It's a colorful book as well, full of beautiful swirling scenes and bold shapes. The use of Spanish throughout the text is seamless as well, never striking the reader as out of place or jarring. This book would read well with other stories that incorporate more than one language in their text. Or, kids could read it with other picture books that take place in Hispanic communities. Or, it could be paired with other stories where hungry preying animals fail to get a meal. A beautiful book to read aloud to groups 
 Though not as well-known as wings as JG 52 or JG 26, Jagdgeschwader 51 'Molders' was one of the Luftwaffe's top units. John Weal relates the story of this illustrious unit in this 'Aviation Elite Units' volume from Osprey.  Possessing more Knight's Cross winners than any other Jagdgeschwader, JG 51 flew combat from 1939 to the bitter end, chiefly on the Eastern Front. Flying Bf 109s and then FW 190s, the wing scored over 8,000 victories. Wing aces included 'Toni' Hafner, Heinz Bar, Richard Leppla, Karl-Gottfried Nordmann, Gunther Schack and, of course, Werner Molders,   Molders, Germany's finest fighter leader-tactician and the first Luftwaffe pilot to score 100 victories was an intriguing individual. Commanding JG 51 from July 1940 to July 1941, he set a fast pace for the wing, especially when JG 51 was committed to the Eastern Front. A devout Catholic in the service of history's most evil empire, Molders was nicknamed 'Vati' (Daddy) by his men. Upon his death in November 1941 while serving in a staff position, the wing was given the Honor Title 'Molders.'    JG 51's combat exploits are well summarized in Weal's 128-page book. Over 100 photos and nine pages of color profiles illustrate the wing's life, times and equipment.   As far as I know, this is the first English-language history of JG 51 so, if you are interested in Luftwaffe fighter wings, this is a must-have book.  **** As a personal aside, I wish the Osprey Elite books were a bit longer in length so authors could devote some space to catching the spirit...the flavor...the character of the units and their aircrew 
 I just want to write and let everyone know 'On Killing' is an awesome book, not only for elite military and law enforcement, but for dispatchers as well, or anyone who has a spouse in the military or law enforcement.  'On Killing" and Daves sequel 'On Combat' are both awesome books that gives the reader a good insight to how the body [both mentally and physically] reacts to being in the line of fire.  Both books are also good books for the dispatchers behind the radio to read.  I speak from experience on the police dispatcher angle.  It really helps put things in perspective, to know what my officer's are dealing with helps me behind the radio and makes sure they get home safely to their families.  It also helps put into perspective the feelings that you go through when you work a major incident, or even one that isn't major but plays in your mind, or as Dave describes it as the 'puppy rearing it's ugly head trying to get in the screen door'.  Both books help with this and goes through the feelings you might be going through, and puts it in perspective.      Dave is a great person, a very enthusiastic speaker who selflessly gives of himself and his time to reach out to people world-wide.  He trains and teaches them, and prepares them for that time when the wolf comes knocking at the sheeps door, which is when the sheepdogs, our 'Warriors' who answer the call who respond bravely to the call for help and are there to protect the flock!!     I am writing this in hopes it might help, to write what's in the book would be giving away the true meat of the matter!!  Both books are great and highly recommend them as a must read!!    Hooah...And may all the "WARRIORS" be watched over and guarded, those abroad who are our swords as well as the "WARRIORS" at home who are our shields!!    "Sabrhawke" 
 Joan Baez delivers an enchanting performance on her collection, "Gracias A La Vida" (Thanks to Life). I owned it many years ago (in the 1970's) on vinyl. I was so pleased to find it on CD through Amazon.com. Her Spanish is impecable, and her delivery of such traditional Spanish folk ballads such as "La Llorona" (The Weeping Woman), "Guantanamera", "Cucurrucucu Paloma", "De Colores", "Las Madres Cansadas", and "No No, Nos Moveran" is no less than entrancing. Her crystal clear, bell like tones only add to the ethereal experience of this homage to latin culture. Baez lovers will cherish it. Even those unfamiliar with her work will find it hard to resist. Largo vive Joan Beaz! - Lily Marlowe - Denver, Colorad 
 Another winner by Koontz.  A bit strange, but still a good read 
 This movie kicks butt. Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely terrifying as Ace. That guy can act, no s**t. I totally forget I am watching an actor. He is so cruel that his presence hangs over the whole movie and meshes with the summery-yet-dark atmosphere that it gives it a great flavor. You just know they're going to meet him at the end the whole time, and that creates great suspense. Wil Wheaton pushes a line or two but does OK, he has a tough role. Much better than Wesley Crusher.   The best part of the movie is that it is so true to life. We were all ten years old not so very long ago and that person still lives in all of us.  The lighting is really good: most of the film is shot outdoors and if it's augmented by stage lighting they did a good job, it looks like natural sunlight most of the time.   [...]  I just have to say this. When River Phoenix fades out at the end it is just plain CREEPY in light of what happened to him later. I get the shivers every time I watch the whole movie only to come to this part. A completely unintended piece of writing that became the twist that just makes watching this movie an unreal experience. This is one of my favorite movies. :   
 www.AbsolutePunk.net  Blake Sennett is gonna grab you by the bootstraps and giddyup off into the sunset with your country heart, assuming you've got one. Finally answering the question, "What would Elliot Smith have sounded like if he dug up his old lap-steel and watched too many old Clint Eastwood flics?" (not that anyone ever actually asked) the Rilo Kiley guitar-man lays down part breathy emo cry-baby and part baroque alt-country ballad and ends up with something either simply endearing, overly glitzy, or a combination of the two.  A relatively far cry from Rilo Kiley counterpart and love interest Jenny Lewis' nakedly melodic solo debut, and also from The Elected's electronically pampered premiere, the sophomore Sun, Sun, Sun bursts with a sense of relief and exuberance. Despite Sennett's always meek vocal quality, the arrangements on this disc flood forth like rays of sunshine through the clouds, unabashedly hopeful and maybe even celebratory. You've got to imagine that an artist titling his record as such isn't dwelling on the gloomy side of life, and while bluesy at times, these songs certainly won't get you down. As Blake says in the soulful "Did Me Good", "I've seen trouble come my way/I've seen many a dark day/But I've seen the sun comin' up in your face." Each song seems to develop a cheerful mantra of sort, as the choruses repeat phrases like "It was love," "I'm not going home, I'm already there," "You did me good," and "I'll be your man."  In the vein of Bright Eyes and similar projects, there is a wealth of personal story-telling going on in the verses, making for a distanced listening experience, which really sets the instrumental work on display. The abundance of clean licks, rhythmic keys, and an expressive brass section will charm your ass relentlessly, but by the time track 11 or so rolls around, the luster starts to feel too familiar, and you might find yourself wishing Mike Mogis had been back on board for the second go-around.   Call it pageantry, or call it an artist merely expressing radiance, Sun, Sun, Sun shines vibrantly throughout. Perhaps there is no song as thrillingly sweet as Me First's "A Time for Emily" and perhaps the record as a whole is lighter fare than the last. Still, you can't fault a man for making a big cheery record, especially not when it's crafted by hands and hearts as skilled and delicate as those of The Elected.  -www.AbsolutePunk.ne 
 I have to say I really enjoyed this book.... no it's not Hemingway but it is fast moving and held my interest from the first page.  For a first time novelist, I give it two thumbs up.  I have certainly read worse by more established authors.  I read the entire book on a flight from Paris to Chicago and it was one of the fastest flights I have even taken.  Thank you Bill for an enjoyable story.  Will we be seeing more of Ashley Van Buren and Tommy O'Malley?  I sure hope so 
 I found this book extremely insightful and gentle at a time when I needed a book to be just these things.  It is written in a style that is both general and very specific at the same time.  It spoke to my loss very keenly, but I felt it spoke to the concept of grief quite articulately and gave much needed permission for grief on one's own terms.  I am going to get a copy for my sister and I recommend it as a condolence offering or for anyone who has lost a loved one.    
 Lily Yu and her werewolf (lupi) bondmate, Rule, may have escaped Hell, but they are not through with demons. While some may in jest suggest that demons run the government, when officials are truly making deals with devils, the Secret Service turns to Lily and Rule to help put a stop to it. They, in turn, enlist the help of a sorcerer, Cullen Seabourne, and former "dizzy," Cynna in dealing with the magic. Making matters worse is the fact that Rule is suffering from a magical wound that will not heal and is making him lose control of his inner wolf. The four allies find themselves in a deadly contest to keep an ancient demon from acquiring dangerous lore, threatening life as we know it.  **** The world Ms. Wilks overlays against the one we know is an exciting one that becomes more fascinating as layers of it are revealed. Seeing the continuing evolution of established relationships is intriguing and only makes you want to know the characters more. Adding new faces and plots is done in such a way as to enhance the old, not detract from, or ignore it. Moreover, Ms. Wilks shows just enough sensuality to give us romance to go along with the fast-paced, tense action, but does not go into excessive graphic detail. For these reasons and others you can only discover by experiencing the novel, Ms. Wilks is a true master of her craft. ****  Amanda Killgor 
 After I read this book I reordered three more.  One for every one of my adult children.  I have recommended it to all my friends.  It is such a great success story.  I visited NYC 20 years ago and it was scarry.  I have been there several times recently and it is delightful. He really did transform the city like no other leader before him.  In addition he led the nation through 9/11 with strength and dignity (while fighting cancer!)    A great book I can not recommend highly enough 
 This is a well researched, well detailed,(some might say exhaustive),decently  written biography of the life , career ,loves and death of Natalie Wood, who is one of the most beautiful , gifted,legendary actresses in Hollywood history. The book even reaches   far back into Natalie's parents history ,long before she was  conceived. And Finstead certainly has a warm,reverent, affectionate ,respectful feeling and tone towards her subject which   is not  always present in biographies. That doesn't mean  the book is without its flaws though.Far from it.  Despite the books length,I feel it only  skimmed over parts of really fascinating areas of her life like her friendship with James Dean , areas that could have been much more deeply explored while shedding too much light on what I felt were less significant areas of her  life by comparison such as people she  had a few casual dates with. The most serious fault of the book is its reporting of unsubstantiated speculation and rumor in the breakup of her first marriage to Robert Wagner. Instead of making clear that it was speculation and rumor, the book treated it as cold, hard fact. Another serious flaw of the book is its detailed printing of the Wagners' boat Captain Dennis Davern of the events of the night of Natalie's tragic death. From what I understand, Dennis Davern has changed his story several times,is not seen as reliable and his motivation is largely financial. The book basically makes a lot of nasty accusations towards Robert Wagner with almost no proof whatsoever to back them up. I think thats pretty unfair since he was cleared of any wrong doing by the Police not long after Natalie's drowning and he was the undisputed great love of her life.  Another thing about the book that is annoying is sometimes when she uses quotations its almost impossible to determine who is speaking. I do give the book credit for shedding a lot of light on important areas of her life that have been somewhat unknown in the past,like her two early intense love affairs that her Mother broke up and her Father's desperately unhappy , frustrated life.  Overall, a nice tribute to Natalie because of the feeling with which it was written but not  entirely fair or accurate to some important people in her life 
 In this fully illustrated and remarkably brief book, Hawking provides an overview of the state of theoretical physics at the dawn of the 21st century. The often dense text is supplemented by biographical details, witty asides, and (especially) luxuriously reproduced introductions.  Hawking covers a lot of territory in 200 pages; he hopes to provide brief, non-intimidating summaries of recent concepts and new frontiers in science. There is astonishingly little text, and at times the pithiness, compactness, and occasional "cuteness" may work against readers' understanding; there's perhaps too much shell and not enough nut here. Some sections are so cursory that I suspect they will fail to make any sense at all to the untutored reader. (This is especially true of several of the passages on imaginary time, event horizons, and brane world models.)   The text is aided greatly, however, by the beautifully rendered four-color illustrations. Even if the concepts presented by these drawings seem fuzzy at first, the creativity and humor fused into Moonrunner Design's artwork will attract, engage, and occasionally tease readers who might otherwise be frightened by the sight of a quadratic equation.   Overall, then, the book might have far more value as a refresher course for the beginner rather than as an introduction for the uninitiated. Yet it's certainly conceivable that somebody new to this material might be intrigued enough to explore these subjects further. If you're looking for a book that will flesh out the concepts presented here, I strongly recommend (as does Hawking) Alan Guth's "The Inflationary Universe" or Brian Greene's "The Elegant Universe. 
 Not only do I thoroughly enjoy the provocative "Orphans Preferred," but I was fortunate enough to have Chris Corbett as my advisor, journalism professor, and mentor in college. He is a brilliant, hilarious, talented writer and journalist who weaves an intricate web of fact and detail. His specialty is anecdote. "Orphans Preferred" takes an almost forgotten subject and re-invigorates it. Never boring. 
 I bought this book to give to one of my kids as a reward for doing a great job on report card!  I haven't given it to my daughter just yet but I have read the book and thought it was really great.  A nice book for children in the ages of 6ish to 8ish.  
 In Las Vegas, anything goes and usually does.  A new reality show is coming to town Teen Idol, a program that involves teens competing in two age groups to become queens of their respective divisions can be picked.  Unknown to Lieutenant Carmen Molina of the Las Vegas Police Department, her daughter Mariah entered the teen competition and made the cut.  Molina reluctantly allows her daughter to go for the two weeks in house event but worries because someone is mutilating the advertising posters and a girl was killed on the site where the audition occurred.  Molina asks Temple Barr to go undercover and enter the contest as a teen so she can watch over Mariah; she agrees because Max is nowhere around and hasn't been in quite some time.  Her friend Matt is in Chicago looking for some clue that will lead him to the identity of his biological father.  A serious of mischievous threats culminates in the murder of the contest's dietician.  Temple with the help of her feline companion Midnight Louis investigates to stop the killer from murdering others.  Carole Nelson Douglas always keeps her series fresh by taking her characters in different directions and CAT IN A HOT PINK PURSUIT is no exception.  For long time fans, secrets are finally revealed and the heroine makes a life alternating decision.  The story is told in the third person point of view except when Midnight Louis is on stage and he gives his first hand perspective.  This writing technique is deftly handled by Ms. Douglas so that this charming and entertaining mystery is a must read for people who like creative and riveting amateur sleuth tales told mostly by one with a tail.

 Steinbeck's novels are some of the most powerful statements about American culture available on the planet.  But who knows the writer?  Travels with Charley lets readers get to know John Steinbeck, how he thinks, what he believes in, all with great wit and intimacy.  Steinbeck is a very funny man.  I even learned a new respect for poodles.  What else could you want in a book 
 I think Gertrude Stein is a supreme literary artist of the 20th century, and this anthology offers a wide range of her work, which ranges from poetry to essays. Her writing is difficult to penetrate, but in her case, and I rarely say this about abstruse writing, it enhances the effect. It's as if underneath words lies the human being itself, in all its feeling and rhythms, and language is a mere shadow of this self. Her words are like paths crisscrossing around the being, so that the reader can eventually see the whole. Magnificant artist. She also was apparently a good person, having befriended Hemingway, James, Picasso and others. A+ 
  THis is a perfect introduction to Soundgarden.  I highly reccomend this to fans of grunge, post-grunge, post-metal, etc.  Also, if you're a fan of Audioslave and you haven't yet checked out this band, this one is for you.  A sides provides an excellent sampling of their work which covers from their early sub-pop days therough their big grunge period with tracks from Superunknown, riught up to their final album, Down on the Upside.  It even includes one previously unreleased track from the Down on the Upside recording sessions, "Bleed Together."  I can't say enough about soundgarden.  Cornell's lyrics and vocals and Kim Thayil's guitar are all brilliant.  Aoundgarden stands with Nirvana as the greats to emerge from the Seattle music scene 
 I normally prefer romantic / comedies but this movie is definitely one of my favourite movies ever.  This movie has a bit of everything in it.  My entire family loves it 
 This is the story of Tysen, the ultra conservative Sherbrooke brother of this series.  When he inherits a Scottish castle he meets Mary, the local bastard who has been left a big dowry from her late father.  Of course, they fall in love (was there any doubt).  There is a really hilarious scene in which they travel to the city to find out how big her dowry really is.  If you have read any of the Sherbrooke series, you will enjoy this book 
 As owner of an ad agency, I can tell you -- reading this book is ESSENTIAL to anyone who ever wants to be taken seriously in advertising.    It would be easy for you to think that a book on advertising first published in 1984 would be so out of date as to be obsolete today, but in this case you would be wrong.  No, it doesn't cover Internet ads, cell phone text message ads, electronic ads in elevators and taxis, or other recent "innovations," but the lessons here apply to ANY media - old or new.  That's part of what makes this so indispensible, especially if you ever hope to own and run an ad agency.  Some of the chapter titles alone say exactly what you'll find here: - How to produce advertising that sells - How to run an ad agency - How to get clients - The secrets of success in business-to-business advertising - 18 miracles of research - Is America still top nation? - What's wrong with advertising?  The straightforward style and clarity of message you read in those titles is indicative of how Ogilvy spoke in person, and how he speaks throughout this book.  And unlike the actual text books foist upon me in college, these chapters are written by someone who actually lived the life and made a serious fortune doing it.  This is not a technical "how to" book, of course, but knowing the principles behind each of these topics BEFORE reading the technical how-to is extremely helpful.  There are those who look through this book and think the ads Ogilvy talks about -- his own and others' -- are "quaint" or out of fashion, but that's just creative hubris and small-minded ignorance.  If you really pay attention to what Ogilvy has to say, and view the featured ads in context, you'll see how applicable it still is to reaching people...and selling to them...today.  Reading this book may not make you great at advertising, but NOT reading and learning from it will weaken your chances.  Good luck

 Stargate Atlantis is in my opinion, the best Scifi show out there.  The look and feel of the show is amazing, and the characters have depth and appeal.  Remember to watch the show LIVE in the U.S. too, that's the only way the ratings will count!  Remember, we have to keep the ratings up to get the show renewed for further seasons 
    Being experienced in the chaos that poorly managed change can create within organizations, I fully appreciate the concise and insightful approach to managing change that Dr. Beitler takes in his book. Morale, productivity, and service all suffer when change adversely affects an organization. From the start, Dr. Beitler takes a strategy driven approach and helps the reader to understand obstacles and resistance change agents will encounter.      My favorite part of the book is "Write down everything you don't know". Wow! This is a powerful concept. Performance Appraisal ranks a close second. Honestly appraising the performance of an employee may be uncomfortable at times, but it is essential to managing change effectively.     Having completed countless change projects, I found myself nodding my head and laughing in places at the accurate, real world examples that Dr. Beitler uses. There were Aha moments too when he described incidents that helped me understand my own experiences more fully.     I highly recommend this book for any person who is or aspires to enter the field of management. As managers, we are all agents of change. Strategic Organizational Change prepares the manager for what inevitably lies ahead.   
 if you have never read alain de botton, i would recommend reading "how proust can change your life," "the art of travel," or "consolations of philosophy" first, as they are, in my opinion, his best writing.  this is not a bad book at all, i just don't think it is his best effort.    this wasn't too bad, it was well organized and well researched.  Some parts became very dry and academic, and it felt like something was missing, as if his heart wasn't fully in this book.  He introduces the five main reasons we feel anxious about our status in life, then gives five solutions to dealing with the anxiety, however, at times it seems he is reaching for causes or solutions.  There were some good points made, and he uses enough history, art, and poetry to make his points, which add to the fullness of the book, but it still seemed, at times, a bit contrived.  i liked the book and enjoyed it, it shed some light on why we act the way we do and it was entertaining and well written.  i just think it wasn't up to par compared to his previoius books.  
 I am a huge fan of world war 2 first person shooters. I've been with the genre since the begining of medal of honor. since then, not too much has been more impresive to me than call of duty. It was a wonderfual game and still is. Call of Duty 2 was even better. Does this new game maintain the stellar streak the series is on? in a word, yes. Although, it is alot more of the same. But then again, why mess with a great formula? Call of Duty 3 works because it is exactly what the original game was built around, sheer intensity....and also alot of fun. But then you might say, well i've played COD2, are you saying its the same? Yes and No. The basic mechanics are the same and the few newly added gameplay elements do little to nothing for the overall game so in escense. Yea, its the same game. But this time around the levels are bigger and look o so much prettier. Honestly, these are some of the most amazing visuals on the xbox 360. I dare say it puts my beloved COD2 to near shame. The lighting and texturing is beautiful and the explosions are heart stopping to behold. The life like graphics are complimented by a brilliant musical score. Oh, and if anyone should wonder about the ingame soundeffects, just pop in a previous call of duty game and imagine it amped up even more. Seriously, the battlechatter has never been so nicely integrated. COD3 is yet another amazing world war 2 game that will certainly keep veterans of the genre happy and content, meaning on the edge of your seat. The newly implimented rag doll physics and destructable enviroments will make sure you stay there too. I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone who has played a world war two first person shooter and enjoyed it because what we have here ladies and gentelmen is the latest and greatest, the best that money can buy 
 It may seem fantastical that a Black woman is involved with Scandanavia but that is her heritage. Reading Passing made me wish that I had lived in Harlem in that era so I went back to the library and read as much as I  could on Black America in that area at that time.  It made me do research  on the Dunbar Hotel here in Los Angeles.  The scene on the rooftop  restaurant was riveting and even I grew uncomfortable with the staring  scene. Quicksand was a totally different tragedy and just as compelling.  Imagine having that much uncertainty in your life, educated or not. I can  see that if the time period had been different and the book was turned into  a movie by Tarentino, the main character would have surely turned to hard  drugs and some form of retaliation by murder 
 The Stones have never made a complete dud, but I just think the 60's albums were the most fun. "Beggar's Banquet" is sort of the "unplugged" concept (with the odd very electric exception), but it doesn't get soft in any way. There is some country, folk, blues, rock, and it is played so damn pure! "Sympathy for the Devil" is great, just as dark as any Black Sabbath tune, and likely the song you'll buy this for. "Stray Cat Blues" is not blues at all, but a great hard rock tune. After that, it's mostly acoustic numbers, but they hit you HARD. It's more mature than the earlier stuff, darker than what came later, and it's one of the best things ever made. Not particularly experimental, it falls through the cracks when critics make their "best of" lists, BUT, I would say this is the BEST non-metal hard rock album of all time. Also the best album of 1968, and that sais something 
 This case is a good solid case, with a very pretty design. At first I was skeptical about the 'bulk' but it fits on great and looks AMAZING. I have recieved numerous compliments on this case. I gave it 4 stars, however, because when you do drop the case (when it needs protection) the front part pops off 
 Bakunin's political beliefs rejected governing systems in every name and shape, from the idea of God downwards; and every form of external authority, whether emanating from the will of a sovereign or from universal suffrage. He wrote in his Dieu et l'Etat or God and the State (published posthumously in 1882):  "The liberty of man consists solely in this, that he obeys the laws of nature, because he has himself recognized them as such, and not because they have been imposed upon him externally by any foreign will whatsoever, human or divine, collective or individual."  Natural laws being thus recognized by every man for himself, Bakunin's reasoning went, an individual could not but obey them, for they would be the laws also of his own nature; and the need for political organization, administration and legislation would at once disappear.  Bakunin similarly rejected the notion of any privileged position or class, since "it is the peculiarity of privilege and of every privileged position to kill the intellect and heart of man. The privileged man, whether he be privileged politically or economically, is a man depraved in intellect and heart."  Bakunin's methods of realizing his revolutionary program were no less purposeful than his principles. The revolutionist, as Bakunin described, would be a devoted man, who allowed no private interests or feelings, and no scruples of religion, patriotism or morality, to turn him aside from his mission, the aim of which is by all available means to overturn the existing society.  The dispute between Mikhail Bakunin and Karl Marx highlighted the difference between anarchism and communism: While both anarchists and communists share the same final goal (the creation of a free, egalitarian society with no social classes and no government), they strongly disagree on how to achieve this goal. Anarchists believe that the classless, stateless society should be established right away, as soon as possible. Communists believe that such a thing would be impossible and that the anarchists are too idealistic; the communists want a more gradual transition towards the classless and stateless society, involving a transitional stage of democratic government and planned economics, which they call "socialism".   His works are erudite and forceful and should be read by anyone interested in polictical science and/or philosophy 
 Well written, exceptionally easy to understand and more importantly not just another vacuous theory book. It is applied modeling, which is what makes the book a very engaging read. One of my top two Kondratiev wave picks.  
 As Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet I have put on cooking demonstrations for Le Creuset in Singapore, and this is one of my favourite cooking utensils because it is two in one. Why? Simply because the Tagine dish you cook in, is also your serving dish. I love to cook my original recipes like Tagine of Chicken and Apricots or Beef and Prune Tagine. The cavity at the top is for you to put ice cubes or water so it cools the Tagine funnel allowing the steam to condense and roll back down the sides. Tagines have been use in Morocco for years and is a perfect way to cook with very little water and at the same time seal in all the delicious flavours. The exotic Tagine is also a conversation piece when you bring it out to serve at the dining table. And...when you open the cover and your guests get a whiff of all the incredibly appetising smells that have been hitherto imprisoned, they will swoon with delight. Add some salad or couscous and with your Tagine you'll enjoy a splendid meal. Made of solid cast iron you can use it for all manner of stoveware from magnetic induction to electric. I also use it in the oven to bake my Tagine or even to make that classic French dessert Clafoutis. Enjoy!

 this book presents hundreds of asanas, with beautiful illustrations and eminently understandable instructions.  despite what the back cover says, I don't think I would recommend this book to a beginner.  there are many other books out there, such as How to Use Yoga or The Sivananda Companion to Yoga, that provide more of the background and advice that a beginner needs.  this book is basically a catalog of poses.  unless you have a solid basis to work from it's probably not for you.  but if you have been practicing yoga for some time and are familiar with most of the poses and techniques, this book would be a great addition to your collection 
 Harry Bosch is a detective working for LAPD's Open Unsolved Unit. Marie Gesto's 1996 disappearance, a case to which Bosch was assigned when he was in Homicide, was never solved. Her clothes were found neatly folded on the front seat of an abandoned car parked in the garage of a vacant luxury apartment but her body was never recovered and the case has eaten at Bosch ever since. Thirteen years later, Raynard Waits was pulled over in his van in the early morning hours in Echo Park but the traffic stop turned out to be far from routine. The officers discovered two trash bags in the van that contained the dismembered body parts of two women. In an effort to avoid the death penalty, Waits and his lawyer, Maurice Swann, negotiate a deal with the prosecuting attorney, Rick O'Shea, in which Waits confesses to nine murders including Marie Gesto's and promises to lead the police to the location of her long buried body.  But every good detective knows that the devil is in the details and there are a few things about Waits' story and the structure of the deal that just don't ring true for Bosch. So despite all evidence to the contrary, Bosch persists in the investigation, gets in a lot of faces and takes us on an amazing roller coaster ride to the astonishing solution that has avoided his grasp for so many years.  Echo Park is a brilliant piece of literary craftsmanship that isn't so much thriller as hard-core, rock solid police procedural - gritty, sweaty, dynamic, realistic, fast-paced, exciting, political and filled to the brim with a wealth of informative detail. But, make no mistake about it, the plot is still a hard-driving page turner and doesn't let up for a single page from start to finish. An old acquaintance and working colleague, FBI agent Rachel Walling, provides Bosch with expertise in psychological profiling and fleshes out Connelly's story with a romantic twist that ends in a much more down to earth fashion than we've come to expect from more run-of-the-mill novels.   Congratulations to Michael Connelly! He seems to be moving from strength to strength. The Lincoln Lawyer was outstanding, Echo Park was superb and there's certainly no indication that his momentum is flagging!  Paul Weis 
 This not-quite-debut novel (Fellowes wrote several romance novels in the mid-'70s under the name Rebecca Greville, including "Poison Presented" and "Court in the Terror") ought to appeal to fans of his 2001 Oscar-winning script for the film Gosford Park. A straightforward satirical comedy of manners set among the upper classes of mid-'90s England and those who aspire to join them, the book is a frothy comic brew which skewers both parties with the kind of pitch-perfect subtle writing that it seems only the British can pull off. The story is quite simple, a pretty woman from an upper middle-class family whose mother has pretentions decides to ensnare a hugely wealthy and dull aristocratic man in order to "marry up" into the upper classes which still hold such a mystique and importance in British society. The man's mother, a formidable Marchioness aims to prevent this from occurring but fails. The young woman discovers that life at the top isn't as exciting as she anticipated and runs off with an handsome actor to great scandal. Will anyone find happiness at the end?  This is all more or less narrated by a semi-aristocratic actor (clearly very much like the author) who is able to move between all worlds due to his upbringing and career. He starts the book as a friend of the young woman and a very passing acquaintance of the young man, and ends up becoming a bridge between worlds and at the latter stages, a kind of discreet go-between. It is his penetrating sardonic insights and the witty formulations thereof which lend what substance there is to this otherwise straightforward love story. Much of the novel involves the narrator spelling out the unspoken rules of the game for the reader in deliciously mocking detail. The main flaw in most satire is that it is too broad or unsubtle, but here the narrator's mockery of the artificially preserved world of the aristocracy is all the more effective from its insider position. To be sure, the characters are mostly "types" without a whole lot of substance or depth to them (the boorish rich pig, the nasty arriviste, the brisk no-nonsense wife, the ice queen, the social climber, etc.), but that's kind of the point as well. A great deal of the satire is that these upper crust people have no personality, that they are all just filling the roles they've seen before them and imagine will extend after them forever. Ultimately, the book is somewhat bittersweet in that the writing is quite amusing, but one can't help but feel slightly sorry for how unhappy so many of the characters are (even if they aren't particularly deeply drawn). On the other hand, it's not too hard to feel like it's a case of them getting their just desserts... 
 Me against my brother provides the reader with not only an understanding of the conflicts in Somalia, Sudan, and Rwanda, but it is also a personal tale of the author's experiences in Africa.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in Africa or international relations. The descriptions are often depressing and heartwrenching, but it instills in the reader that the developed world must do more to help ease the suffering in Africa 
 The Fifth Elephant is a City Watch novel of Discworld, where the newly proclaimed Duke of Ankh-Morpork, His Grace Commander Samuel Vimes, goes to Überwald as an ambassador, looking for fat deposits caused by the legendary crash of the Fifth Elephant into the regions of Überwald. However, problems in Ankh-Morpork arise, and Captain Carrot is left in charge of the watch. Mr. Sonky is found dead in his vat for making rubber thingys, and the replica of the Scone of Stone, the crowning seat of the dwarves made of the famous dwarf bread, has been stolen.Vimes leaves with Lady Sybil, Sergeant Detritus, Corporal Littlebottom, and a helpful "clerk", Inigo Skimmer. At Überwald, the actual Scone is stolen, and all the dwarves look shifty. There's also some werewolf trouble, and Sergeant Angua of the Watch comes along too. Captain Carrot follows, leaving Sergeant Fred Colon to lead the watch. Needless to say, with all that power, he goes around throwing his excessive weight around. The sugar lumps keep disappearing...  A great Night Watch book, the suspense is all right, but there are some surprises and such to keep any reader happy. A good book to be read, just not over and over again 
 this is a thought-provoking book about self-injury and healing. the book is well-written and very descriptive. many narratives are used in the text, and this helps to create a greater understanding of individual experiences and struggles. this is important because each of us experiences things in our own way. that perception then becomes reality for us. once that happens, we find ways to deal with the emotional intensity that this can create. for many, the coping mechanism of choice is self-injury. self-injury is very difficult for many people to understand--even those who self-mutilate often come to treatment without a real understanding of why they harm themselves. once you understand the chain of events, you can start to better understand the compulsive nature of this behavior, the way in which the self-injurer sees self-harm as the only alternative, the only way to obtain some relief from the present experience. one caveat--i disagree with the authors' depiction of self-mutilation as NOT a manifestation of addiction. in my work with patients who self-injure, it has become very clear to me that this behavior feels very compulsive and can become habitual. also, in line with the AA model of treating addiction, patients most often do better when they recognize the power that self-injury has over them and start to explore the origins of their psychological pain in an attempt to stop expressing this pain through self-harm. information on the SAFE Alternatives program is also very helpful. statistics regarding success and healing are very encouraging, and these authors clearly have a good thing going. another excellent read is marilee strong's book *a bright red scream: self-mutilation and the language of pain. 
 The authors of this book helped me get started in online IPO trading.  I followed their steps and am finding huge success with IPOs!  On my first trade, I bought 100 shares at $12 and sold at $20.  I was pleased with this  profit, because it was considerably more than I get from other "short  term" investments.  I waited for the right IPO to "freakin'  hit!" as the authors say, and hit one that made me over $11,000 profit  in about two hours on the first day of trade.  I STILL can't believe it!   The book clearly details everything you need to know and do to get into  trading IPOs online.  If you have more questions, the authors even have  their own website where you can contact them and get your questions  answered.  They know their stuff!  What a great book 
 I highly recommmend this book. The characters and situations are multidimensional and very believable.  It shows us how far some of us will go to deny the truth to maintain the status quo 
 In "Climate Considerations in Building and Urban Design" based on the natural factors and environmental capacities, there are very useful techniques in terms of thermal comfort achievement and energy saving. Passive solar systems including greenhouse, solar chimney, thermal roofs and wall, with simple and clear explanation are presented in this book. This is recommended basic book and perfect reference for all students that they are studying in thermal comfort and passive solar systems in architecture.  Finally for those that like to know how to use the natural possibilities to achieve thermal comfort in building, Givoni presents a clear reference with good figures and brief explanation.        
 Back in the early 90's En Vogue was a quartet that consisted Black California Cindy Herron, Maxine Jones, Dawn Robinson, and Terry Ellis, and just like many other early 90's groups they blended Hip Hop & R&B and En Vogue did it with great results. They were one of the most succesful girl groups since Supreemes, but apart from the 60's group En Vogue didn't have 1 leadsinger but 4. The 1990 Debut album was a decent success, and it gave them 2 hits "Hold On" that hit #2 on the Billboard charts and "Lies", but "Funky Divas" from 1992 was clearly the album of their life and the hit singles were only getting more and richer. Funky Divas delivers a great blend of diversity (Soul, Pop, Hip Hop, Dance and Rock), intellegent pop lyrics and hit singles, it also completely filler free. Infact it gave them 5 hits.  Funky Divas starts with a funky number called "This Is Your Love", although it got a long annoying interlude it's a very catchy song that mixes, soul, funk and pop. The lyrics say "This is your life, You Got To Live it Your Own Way", second song is the well known "My Lovin',(You're Never Gonna Get It)" a catchy girl power pop-soul song that I bet most people have heard. "Hip Hop Lover" combines what this early 90's Soul era was famous for, R&B and Hip Hop, it also feautures a guest rap.  The rocky "Free Your Kind", is a song about prejudices and differences in the society, it came after the Los Angeles Riots and the lyrics couldn't make more sense "Free Your Mind and the Rest Will Follow, be Colorblind, don't be so Shallow". "Desire" is a fabolous slow paced exotic song that feautures horns, and gives a passionate and laid back feeling. "Give Him Something He Needs" a cover of a Curtis Mayfield song, the girls version is cool and jazzy.  "It Ain't over Till the Fat Lady Sings" another Hip Hop Sounding song, but they sound more like Salt N Pepa then a soul group on this song. "Give It Up, Turn It Loose" is great and resembles "My Lovin" alot. "Yesterday" is a cover of the well known Beatles song, (probably the most covered song in history!), This version is completely diffrent though, it doesn't sound like the same song, they make it their own with this soulish version for sure. "Hooked On Your Love" is incredibly catchy musically with it's horns, the song itself is a laid back sexy soul number also a Mayfield interpretation. "Love Don't Love You" another uptempo soul/pop song and "What Is Love" sounds like a mixure of Soul and Dance, ready for the clubs.  Overall, A fantastic album that I'll give 5 starts for it's catchyness and 5 for it's diversity and mixure of genres. This is truly a unique but a little overlooked album from the early 90's when Soul sounded fresh and full of new ideas. Credits to En Vogue and producers Foster/Mc Elroy cause this album got it all 
 Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is an FBI agent who had bungled in his duty of protecting President Kennedy, and has never forgiven himself since. He is now much older, and makes a number of false moves in trying to protect the present President. He comes across as unfit for the job and comes close to getting suspended. Life is hard for poor old Horrigan.  Leary (John Malkovich) is an ex-FBI agent who had the misfortune of thwarting his partner's attempt to murder him on a direct FBI order. He now holds a grudge against the FBI for this incident, and plots to kill the President.  While we are aware of Leary's methodical planning, it is still suspenseful to see if Horrigan can figure it out. The movie is thrilling to watch and is never boring 
 Bram Janssen's review (21.10.03) did it for me and I do not hesitate to give this album 5 stars and I haven't even bought it yet, but am about to!   Like Bram, I too saw (only some of) that video whilst flicking channels one day and it moved me so much that it has haunted me ever since as I didn't even know what the song was.  My musically talented 19 year old nephew had recently told me that he and his other (up and coming) band members were REAL admirers of Johnny Cash - this puzzled me as I, like Bram, had never really 'known' Johnny or his music - I remember growing up to 'A Boy Named Sue' on the radio when it was a hit but sadly dismissed anything else by Johnny as I thought he was just `country'.  How wrong was I!   Having been influenced by my young and trendy nephew (who, incidentally is into Green Day, Muse, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Nirvana but to name a few), I too am now a fan but alas too late to appreciate Johnny while he was still here with us.  I am, however, comforted that he will live on in the younger generation like my nephew.    Rest in peace Johnny and thank you for your music.  Now all I must do is wait for my CD to arrive, listen, enjoy and no doubt shed some tears for you. 
 The entirety of Ronin involves a narrative that exists on just the other side of "real" -- competing political factions vying for a metal briefcase whose contents are a perpetual mystery.  The "good guys", if they can be called that, are a small coterie of mercenaries who were presumably relieved of their legitimate jobs with the winding down of the Cold War.  They're hired by an Irish faction operating in Paris represented by Dierdre (Natascha McElhone) via the unseen "man in a wheelchair", an agent for these "ronin for hire".  (Ronin were the ancient Japanese samurai who were cast out of their fiefdom for failure to adequately protect their liege, essentially becoming free-agent wandering warriors.)  They are of different nationalities, backgrounds, and possess different talents.  Sam the American (Robert De Niro), develops a kinship with the Frenchman Vincent (Jean Reno) and becomes de facto leader of the band. After a planned exchange for the briefcase goes awry, they devise and execute a violent ambush in the streets of Nice to get the briefcase and take out its current possessors.  When Plan B fails, the fun begins.  Through double-cross and intrigue, the briefcase remains elusive.  Plans are revised, payments are "re-negotiated", and hunters become hunted to the point of making for a five-sided chase. Even the Russians become involved, including an unassuming touring figure skater played by Katarina Witt.  It all sounds very contrived and even trite to a degree, but attached to this story are some of the fiercest street gunfights and most exciting car chases any action film fan could hope for!  Many innocents (and vehicles!) become victims, but these adversaries in espionage openly shop, dine, and roam the streets as if they're tourists and the French authorities are on some far-off planet. Through death and deceit, De Niro and Reno eventually form a buddy-buddy duo to exact revenge and extract payment.  "Old friends from high school" appear out of nowhere to aid in the alternating pursuits and escapes. Ironically, actor Michael Lonsdale, who was so great as the assassin-pursuing French Inspector Lebel in Fred Zinneman's The Day of the Jackal, does a marvelous turn as one of these convenient "friends", providing refuge to the pair for some do-it-yourself surgery.  While the hunt and chase is on, viewers are also treated to some marvelous French town and cityscapes, including the ancient Roman amphitheater at Arles and the traffic tunnels of Paris.  Ronin is a film for those who can suspend their sense of logic to allow themselves to be taken for the ride.  Thankfully, nothing devolves into outright camp a la James Bond. The danger of this approach is that for the film to be effective, the viewer must be held in thrall by these contrived characters and their actions to the point of being oblivious to their real-world consequences. De Niro, director John Frankenheimer and company manage to pull it off.  Because of its sheer unabashed cinematicism and no-holds-barred direction, Ronin succeeds in pushing this reviewer's grade one star above average when the film's holes could just as easily have let it fall one star below 
 Chapter on planar graphs is superbly done, with very easy to understand proofs and plenty of illustrations. Overall, a great introductory tex 
 I find this a great book with some wonderful surpises inside for young boys and girls who are just getting into baseball.  They can learn what it means to be part of team and it shows respect to one another. My grandson had a great time with it 
 I ordered two pink trikes for my granddaughters, their birthdays are 21 days apart. They love them!! I could not beleive the shipping time for these trikes, I think we had them within 48 hours after we ordered them. Nothing but good things to say about this order and the products 
 I saw this at what I believe was it's European premiere in Edinburgh. It was like watching a beautifully choreographed car crash - sublime yet horrifying. It's heart is black. It casts no light. Mike Leigh's vision of the human condition is here presented in so bleak a light that it can only corrode anyone who watches it. I recall that it made me feel physically sick at the time and I described it as the antithesis of everything I believe art should be - yet it is, undoubtebly, art. It is a work of brilliance which does not shine. A black, black, diamond. Yet I still believe it should never have been made. Most people live in hope; this film denies that. Whilst there are some who recognise the nihilistic world it presents, most will be shocked by it - and it's greatest disservice is presenting the world as it is to a majority which will deny it, and live their squinting lives not seeing because of it. A work of too, too, accurate brillance 
 Loved this book. Easy to read. Great launch board for discussions on developing your leadership plans etc. First Maxwell book for me and loved it. Currently am reading 360 degree leader. Great book. Good step by step ideas.]  This book is a must read for any leader or leader "in training" 
 In life, one of the big questions you have to answer is "What am I going to do when I grow up?"  To help you wrestle with the concept of what God has planned for you in terms of ministry and vocation, let me suggest an excellent book entitled The Call: Finding and Fulfilling the Central Purpose of Your Life.   Author Os Guinness explores the concept that God has a calling for each and every Christian - a purpose for your life, something that will enlist and enthrall you, even captivate you!  For most of you, your job will not be your calling; for some, it will be.  But what's the difference, you ask - read The Call to find out!  The concept of a calling has been misunderstood and misapplied for centuries.  Guinness even classifies the common misconceptions as the Catholic myth and the Protestant myth.  But the idea remains important, even central, to every Christian's life and there is no time more critical to explore and answer the age old question about meaning and purpose in life than before you chart a course for your life in the waters of your career.  Guinness writes, "[C]alling is not what it is commonly thought to be.  It has to be dug out from under the rubble of ignorance and confusion.  And uncomfortably it often flies in the face of our human inclinations.  But no idea short of God's call can ground and fulfill the truest human desire for purpose and fulfillment."  While the underlying concept of this book may appear to parallel Rick Warren's immensely popular The Purpose Driven Life, the similarity really ends there.  Guinness' The Call is not an "easy read" and is written at the college level, in terms of vocabulary and depth of insight.  This book is worth its weight in gold and your time to read.  Dostoyevski wrote that "The secret of man's being is not only to live, but to live for something definite."  My prayer is that you find that purpose to which God has called you to and prepared you for - The Call will be an invaluable resource in that journey. 
 This book is a great place to start if you are interested in learning about the life of someone less priviledged than yourself. Perhaps it will help you appreciate the simple pleasures in life and everything that you've got. When you reach the end of the book, you'll be glad Jimenez wrote a sequel (Breaking Through).  Written in a language that is accessible to everyone from grade school to adulthood, Jimenez doesn't exaggerate details or go into a lot of long desriptions. It's simply his memories of his childhood in a migrant family. As all memories go, the book does not flow smoothly from chapter to chapter, but rather gives you snapshots of his life, so take it for what it is and don't worry about the chronology.  As a teacher, this book really helped me appreciate the lives and struggles of many of my students (who lead lives similar to Jimenez in his childhood) 
 Sheingate's path-breaking study into agricultural subsidies is not just for farmers. Anyone interested in how policy is made, the role of interest groups, and the moderation of American politics should read Sheingate's incisive and accessible book. Perfect for the classroom, and those who miss it 
 My three-year old son is an avid Thomas fan and this book so closely mimics the videos that sometimes I can hardly tear him away from the book!   It is a great "learn to read" book for preschoolers.  Even my  16-month old daughter easily recognizes the characters in the books from  those that are in the videos.  My son also likes the fact that there are  several short stories in this book (great for bedtime! )  For any die-hard  Thomas fan this book is a keeper 
 I have only been reading DK for about three year now. So I am more familiar with his newer work. I have been trying to read the old stuff and this was pretty good. I thought the twists and turns were almost hard to keep track of, but for the most part "classic" Koontz 
 If asked which American presidency was the most arrogant, the astute observer of American history might reach back to the presidency of Andrew Jackson for an answer, a presidency that was so arrogant that it defied the Supreme Court and a presidency that ultimately drove David Crockett to Texas. If asked which presidency was the most corrupt, the same observer might be torn between the post-Civil War ambivalence of Ulysses S. Grant and the sneaky tricks of Richard M. Nixon. The observer would be mistaken, however, since history is formed from each passing second and that the presidency of George W. Bush must take precedence as both the most arrogant and the most corrupt presidency in American history. One has to ask: What is it that George W. Bush has against the American people? The man is already filthy rich; each additional dollar that he thieves from the American people cannot possibly improve his way of life in any meaningful way.   No, George W. Bush must be a sociopath-our president is mentally ill and must be removed from office. The place for the House of Representatives to begin is by reading Jack Huberman's "The Bush-Hater's Handbook. From A to Z, Huberman documents George W. Bush's malfeasances like a dictionary of abuse. Facts on top of facts on top of facts, "The Bush-Hater's Handbook" leaves nothing to ambiguity or the imagination, it simply documents this sorry presidency step by step, and arranges the abuse in quick-reference style. George W. Bush is guilty of high crimes and must be removed. 
 For years jazz aficionados have enjoyed revealing the great secret that Cannonball Adderley's "Mercy Mercy Mercy" was not recorded "Live At The Club" as advertised on the cover, but was instead made "live" in the studio.  Well as it turns out that original claim had some foundation.  Cannonball did in fact record his band at "The Club" in Chicago, but earlier that year in March 1966.  Those sessions see their first ever release on this CD as "Money in the Pocket."  Cannonball's band at this time was one of the steadiest and most popular touring groups in jazz.  Brother Nat and Joe Zawinul had been playing with him since the early 1960s, and Roy McCurdy was the group's regular drummer at this time.  (Only bassist Herbie Lewis was in the group for a short period, with this his only recording with the quintet.)  The result is incredible chemistry, even if the material leans a bit too much towards the funky/soulful crossover jazz of the day for my taste.  Overall though, this is an enjoyable disc with good sound and great crowd presence, and it should be in every Cannonball collection 
 Psychotherapy is the one questionable practice that still is widely thought of as a medical science, when it is neither medicine nor scientific. Dawes' book, along with Ofshe's & Watter's "Therapy's Delusions," helps reveal the seriously flawed underpinnings of psychoanalysis, that "great confidence trick of the twentieth century," as Peter Medawar put it. Dawes' book basically says that, while talking about problems can help one, one need not pay for the so-called services of "therapists" when a good friend will do. I hope the day arrives when psychotherapy is recognized for the pseudoscience it is and is no longer paid for with our insurance dollars. Dawes' book will help pave the way for a wider criticism of the field, I think. Too bad there are so few books like Dawes' out there 
 This was not only an INTERESTING history book, but Backman is just a very funny guy and that completely comes across in his writings. The footnotes, typically a skipped portion of my reading, became my favourite details.   The man knows his stuff and likes to engage; there's no reason NOT to read this book 
 This dvd is awesome. It covers Michaels disco years through the 1990s. "Beat it" and "Billie Jean" are timeless videos and show you Michael Jackson at his creative zenith. This dvd also includes the full length videos of "Bad" and "Thriller" Lets not forget "Remember the time" with its amazing dance moves and catchy rythem. This dvd compilation makes you see why Michael Jackson will always be the king of pop. I like this dvd out of all of Michael Jacksons dvd releases. "Dont stop till you get enough" and "Rock with you" may be simple videos but I watch both videos and see an innocence in Michael before the Thriller phenomenon. This is the best of Michael Jackson. Sony dvd has done an incredible job on the sound quality of this Michael Jackson dvd. The sound quality on a regular television or theatre system will amaze you 
 This is a great book about a simple concept - which is why it so valuable!  Stories provide context that help us all learn.  This book provides very helpful suggestions for how to use stories to affect behavior in any organization.  I highly recommend it!   
 I am only 22, so my first knowledge of Bob Newhart came from Nick-at-Nite when I was a kid, but even then I fell in love with his work (although come to think of it, I doubt I got many of the jokes).  That is why when I bought this book the first time I saw it on the shelf. As I first started reading it, the book would talk about different routines Newhart had done at the beginning of his career, and I immediately felt left out, because a lot of this stuff I had never heard before.  However, I was pleasantly relieved when reading further, the book actually had part of the routine he was talking about.  Further reading shows all the routines he mentions in the book are reprinted in the story so no one is left out of the joke. This book is a great inspiration to anyone aspiring to work in comedy, because Newhart shares how he went from working part-time jobs trying to break into a career at "being funny" to becoming an award winning comic and one of the living legends in the comedy world. This book also shows a personal side of Newhart, one where you feel you can really connect with him.  The glimpses he gives into his personal life shows he really is a guy just like the rest of us.   In one part, he talks about how one day he came in and his wife was mad at him, he couldn't think of what he had done, and it turns out she is mad at him because of something he did in a dream, and even though it was only a dream, it still sounded like something he would do.  When I got to that part I made my wife read it and said, "Remember doing that last week?" All around, this is a great book.  Many Hollywood types would flaunt their achievements or exaggerate their accomplishments, but not Newhart.  He presents a straight forward,  entertaining account of his career from the beginning up to today. 
 The title is a bit of a misnomer - it's not the questions that are avoided as much as the reasoning that leads to these answers. It's a breath of fresh air to read something from two leaders who just want to follow God without all the hype and additional baggage that's been piled on by the western church culture over the past few generations. Asking questions should lead to answers that eventually lead to even better questions. This book wins on that count.  Frequently Avoided Questions is a book that will find a prominent spot in my "here, let me let you read this" bookshelf. The premise is that of a conversation: the younger Matt props up the question the way those of our generation are doing, and the older wiser Chuck responds with an even-handed writing style that makes me want to have both of them at my table for coffee. Questions on the necessity of the Bible, the tradition of Sunday church, how evangelicals tend to break complex things down to simple manageable lists - these are great conversations that from my experience do not get started because we're either scared of those questions, or scared of the answers.  These aren't easy or pleasing answers, and there's much to disagree with here. But that's what makes for interesting reading and for good conversation. Take for example these thoughts from "Do I have to go to church?" :  "These churches often promise "community" but provide their members with nothing more than structured small groups. The promise seekers the opportunity to find God but supply them instead with programs (discipleship, membership, Bible training, and so on). The fact is, many churches, whether consciously or not, structure their small groups to control people.  "The control these churches exercise is meant not only to keep people coming back to the church building but also to prevent them from developing relationships outside the church that might lead them away from the church. Also they are designed to meet all the believers' spiritual needs (or at least keep them too busy to do anything else) so that members will not attempt to develop spiritually on their own..." (p. 51, Chuck's response)  As I read this, as a person caught up in what's called a seeker-friendly church and who's heading up the small group stuff at our particular campus - this hits me between the eyes and demands a response. I can't shake it off and ignore it - those are valid points, and it's ultimately a valid question. And that's why I've got to give props to ths authors for putting this together. I've agreed with much of what they've written, including the excerpt above, but at times I've stood on the other side of an issue. Whatever my opinion and take, this book flows with grace and gentleness while also being firm about what's at stake.  Ask the questions, and don't avoid the answers. Want to borrow my copy 
 Alan Lomax interviewed Jelly Roll while doing an extensive set of recordings shortly before Morton's death.  He followed up with a number of interviews with people who knew Jelly Roll.  Lomax did a fabulous job of keeping himself out of the way while letting the often colorful information from the interviews tell the story of Jelly's part in the birth of jazz, a story with triumphs, massive ego and ultimate decline.  I read a library copy and am buying a copy for a present 
 I have purchased this book twice, it is an introduction to digital photography, particularly for the fixed lense Nikon SLR cameras (such as the 8700) and SLR digital cameras.  If you have a simple point and click camera you will get some benefit from the book but not as much.  The book provides a photography primer, clearly explains terms, and gets the reader excited about taking pictures.  Additionally it discusses SLR and non SLR cameras, and digital photo processing using Photoshop (a good portion of this book is dedicated to this task, roughly 40%).  This is a great gift for the person just getting into digital photography or someone looking to expand their skills and knowledge 
 I imagine this concert could be the only time that Schubert's four-hand piano music, which was intended to be played at home, filled Carnegie Hall. Levine and Kissin are stars, but the big surprise is their unanimity--it's nearly impossible to tell on this CD which one is playing the first or second part. I heard not a single slip in ensemble. The music is self-recommending to Schubertians, since every work is a masterpiece (the F minor Fantasy is all but obligatory on such programs).  As to style, Kissin and Levine don't tiptoe around, which is gratifying--they take a forceful, energetic appraoch, and their tempos tend to be brisk. At times the phrasing lacks inwardness, but it's incredibly hard to bring out both the poetry and the strength of Schubert's piano writing. Britten and Richter came closer in their live recordings from the Aldeburgh Festival (BBC Legends), but Levine and Kissin are still first-rate. I am not fond of two-paino music (as the pieces are played here, rather than at a single keyborad), finding it too percussive, but this CD kept my attention from beginning to end. Lots of applause before and after each item, by the way 
 Dolores Claiborne is not an easy read. Not because of the language or the storyline. But because of the story itself, which is quite un-King-like. He wrote many books about the supernatural, monsters and the like but few books about the true monsters - human beings. This book's about these monsters and it's more effective and seductive than King's other books. Don't expect any of his "usual" horror here, though.  The book discovers two mysterious death cases and the strange relationship between two woman who seem to have nothing in common. The first death case is of Vera Donovan, the woman Dolores worked for many years and has just died and Dolores is accused of killing her. Dolores and Vera are two women of different backgrounds, and seemingly different lives. The other death case is of Dolores' husband, who died long ago. How the two cases and the two women become intertwined is the key to the book and I don't want to spoil the fun. But this is only the frame.  What's within this frame is a masterpiece. The book is narrated by Dolores who makes a confession. In a one chapter, monologue style. Her confession introduces us to a woman who suffered a lot, whose life was anything but fun; however she possesses a stunning will to live. The characters she describes are vivid and she, herself is unbelievable. The story is a triumph over injustice and false beliefs.  As a man I was surprised how King knows the soul of women and how he knows what women could think of some situations and things (the starting quotation of the book is from Freud: "Woman! What does she want?"). However, the true motto of the book is one sentence from Vera: "Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has hold onto." True. How many people do you know who live this way? I know a lot and after reading this book I seem to show more respect. One never knows what hides behind a faade.  If you want to have a good read, a deep analysis of a soul that's suffered a lot, if you want to have a true catharsis, this is the book to read. You won't regret it 
 This compiliation of fairy stories is amazing! I enjoyed all of them greatly. I liked Tengu Mountain, The Price of Glamour, Never Never, Imersed in Matter, The Shooter at the Heartcock Waterhole, and The Annals of Eelin-Ok the best. At first I wasn't going to read it because it was so long, but I liked it so much it took me 3 days to read 350 pages. I couldn't stop! I liked this book so much because the stories are all so different and unique. The faries are all so different, and so I never got bored. Never Never was the same plot as Peter Pan, just told in the point of view of Captain Hook. If you want to read a book that is fun, interesting, and a great journey, read the Faery Reel 
 Look, man---you work hard, you gotta play hard, you gotta eat hard.   They're not lying when they say it's a jungle out there: you've got Carruthers slippering up the greasy pole with murder in his eyes and a knife in his teeth, 250 pounds of burning ambition fixed on your job & office.   And it's not even that great of an office: a few plastic-metal cubicle walls stuck together with some fuzzy carpet superglued across the panels. And let's not even talk about the deadlines, the quarterly goals, the beatings administered by senior management in Dread Room 101, the Commute to your cheerless tract home in some nameless, Godforsaken burb.   My point: you work hard, you gotta eat hard. You gotta have RAW MEAT to fuel your toil, and this tofu-veggie crapula everybody's touting nowadays just won't cut it.   In the meantime, even scarfing down that Double Cheeseburger with the Works has become a life-or-death proposition: a vicious strain of Bovine Spongiform Encephalits---or Mad Cow Disease, as it is called for its brutal, brain-busting effects on Old Bessie---is sweeping throughout Europe, which welters under the smoke from a million pyres devouring the bones of cows and sheep.   Take "Dead Meat", for instance. Big goopy Irish horror flick, good solid pacing, lots of chewing and throat masticating and all kinds of good, solid stuff. This one gets to work with minimum fuss or muss with a nasty, weirdly claustrophobic encounter in a dark & spooky barn between a farmer and his, uh, moo-cow.   It's at that point when you realize: Holy God! These cows ain't just mad, they're P*SSED!   Faster than you can say "two all-beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese tomato onions on a sesame-seed bun" two hapless tourists motoring through sleep & bucolic County Leitrim, smack into some ambling fool on the roadway, try to get him in their nasty little English car to take him "to hospital", and wind up getting the Irish zombie version of Open Head Surgery.   Man, is any place safe when it comes to tourism these days?   The rest of the flick is pretty simple: survivors of Zombie apocalypse run, bunker up in cottages & ruined castles & woodlands lees, get eaten, get chunks wripped outta them, face death from unhappy zombie moo-cows, unleash some Irish whupa** on Zombie tush, and fall in love.   Kidding on that last one.   Look: this is a low-budget zombie flick that positively wallows in its beer-budget origins and director Conor McMahon has has enough cinematic moxie to really give this one some punch---particularly in these gorgeous, eerie tracking shots that stalk the characters through the woods, into cottages, peer through keyholes, through gaping panels: the triumph of "Dead Meat" is it brings back some of the renegade, guerilla filmmaker goodness---and eeriness---of Romero back in his salad days.   To sweeten the deal, you get McMahon's directorial debut, the indie short "The Braineater", which is insane, vile, and foul: more than enough to warrant giving the "Dead Meat" DVD a shot.   Got brains?  JS 
 If you were stunned by "Gridlinked," and left awe-struck by "The Line of Polity," then I guarantee you won't be disappointed with "Brass Man." Picking up almost immediately after the end of Line, it continues the saga of ECS agent Ian Cormac, and weaves narratives for many characters introduced in the previous two novels - plus several fascinating new ones - into an extremely satisfying whole. Best of all, it brings back one of the most unique and enigmatic of all of Asher's creations - the flawed yet noble Golem Twenty-Five, Mr. Crane 
 Finally!! I had the original book by Dr Cott "Fasting as a Way of Life", and it was practical, and extremely informative about all aspects of fasting.  I would fast about once every 3 to 4 months, for anywhere from 3 to 7 days. It was wonderful! It kept my weight optimal, I felt energetic, and I was only slightly hungry on the second day of any fast, but no longer than that day.  Once I regained my hunger, I always carefully broke my fast as directed, and felt great afterward.  I lost my copy of that original book many years back, and didn't feel comfortable to fast without some reference. But since the tide had turned in public opinion about fasting, and there weren't many sources of information available.  Thanks to amazon.com 's used book sales, I will get another copy, so that I can once again feel the benefits of fasting.  This book is the one that other authors reference as the authority on fasting, and anyone planning to fast should definitely read it 
 A very insightful book that dived into many area's of healing music. A good portion of the book deals with harmonics, and how they affect the body and also how Gyume Monks of Tibet use overtone chanting. A must read for  people intrigued with sounds and their healing properties 
 the meditators bible .... this book provides the guidance of an teacher for getting over many problems that arise during ones meditative practice 
 I really enjoyed the book, from both a historical perspective as well as what "might have been".   However it can't have been too "secret" at the time.  The 1960 book "Dynamic America" (a history of General Dynamics; parent of General Atomic) says (p 376): "...thousand-ton space platforms propelled by controlled nuclear blasts. But at the Laboratory the possible development of such a vehicle is under serious consideration.  Project Orion - whose ultimate purpose is to put any weight anywhere in our solar system - was conceived by General Atomic scientists and is being financed, as a feasibility study, by the Air Research and Development Command of the United States Air Force 
 I brought this book as a study guide to help get my Australian ham radio license. While this book has all the information needed, and a dedicated student could get their license I found it to be structured in a way that did not allow me to read it easily. Maybe modern magazines have a lot to answer for but I really like  large diagrams in colour, with text structured (with headings etc) so that I can skim rapidly over it and then come back to fill in what I have missed. This book rather put me off geting my license.  
 The setting of Venice is as much a character as Marlena and "the stranger".  I wondered if she was really in love with the stranger or was it just the magic of Venice.  It is a wonderful story of unexpectedly falling in love and doing something very impulsive (selling everything and moving to another country) which is a fantasy for many women but middle aged people don't usually go through with it.  Reality eventually set in and if I were Marlena I would have kicked  Fernando to the curb and gone back home rather than deal with all his moodiness.  I think she had a huge amount of patience with and trust in someone she barely knew.  So it must have been true love but she never did explain why she fell in love with him.  If was evident that she represented freedom and noncomformity to him but I never quite understood her motivation.  What the book did do was make ME fall in love with Venice.  I started drinking prosecco and having "aperitivi" every night, cooking Italian and even booked a trip to Italy for this fall!  The story definitely transported me and that always means it was a good book 
 When Valerie finds out that her mom is lesbian, she is devastated. How did this happen to her? Now she will have to choose who to live with, and there's the problem of what her friends will think once she tells them. So when Valerie's dad says he is moving to some tiny country that no one has heard of because of his new job (protocol chief for royal family), she decides to go with him because, let's face it, who wants to live with their lesbian mother and her girlfriend and transfer to a new school? Although Valerie is upset because she has to leave her friends and a potential boyfriend named David, she soon realizes that living in this new country could get pretty interesting, considering there is a young prince her age living in the palace (Valerie and her father have an apartment there since her father works for the royal family). The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because it is somewhat predictable, but it is still worth your money to buy it 
 I actually bought this to cook w/ my 29 month old daughter.  It is great.  The recipies are made for a small portion.  She was able to mix the apple pie ingredients and roll out the dough with a little help.  She was so proud when I took it out of the oven.  
 As they say, don't judge a book by its cover.  At first glance, this paperback book appears to be a lightweight study guide.  Upon reading it, however, you will find it to contain a mountain of technical information.  Every page offers so many relevant details that you will need to read it twice, just to absorb them all.  Fortunately, it is not written in a dry, jargonistic manner.  As the title implies, the scientific principles involved are simplified for easier digestion and application.  This makes the information all the more useful.  And although it is not a full-fledged textbook, a prospective reader will still benefit from having a basic knowledge of chemistry before opening this book, because it is not a kids' book either.  Take some notes as you read, and you will find it be a real learning experience 
 I rated this book a five because it is a fast paced read about my favorite subject--golf.  I must say, however, that the author's writing style is not nearly as good as it was in his first two books.  This one is far too heavy on golf cliches, platitudes and  "clever" Dennis Miller type analogies. It is also a very thinly disquised redeux of Bagger Vance (but then again, I liked Bagger Vance).  On the positive side, the author offers a number of presumably accurate insights into life on the PGA tour.  Despite the flaws, I did enjoy the book 
 Nearly all of the movies made from Kurt Vonnegut's books are simply awful (HAPPY BIRTHDAY WANDA JUNE, MOTHER NIGHT, BREAKFEST OF CHAMPIONS). There is one delightful exception -- SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE. The makers of this film took the time and trouble to make their movie subtle. They accepted the fact that Vonnegut has never appealed to the loud, over-stimulated, self-absorbed, resource-guzzling masses. Kurt's books appeal directly to the depressed, quiet, suffering young men and women who are still in school and can still think deeply about life.  The hero, Billy Pilgrim, is pretty much carried along by the events happening around him. He finally sees the insanity of trying to take charge of his own life and learns to simply accept things the way they are. This is essentially a Taoist tale. Most stories told by Vonnegut are from a Taoist perspective. The hero is dropped into the middle of a meat grinder of a life and told repeatedly that he must not allow himself to be turned into hamburger. But, contrary to his most feverish and guilt-ridden efforts, he is turned into hamburger. When he finally accepts the reality of being a lump of hamburger, life becomes a little easier for him to deal with.  
 Documentary of the life of artist Andy Warhol is a visually exciting rapid fire attack of 60s psychedelia as seen through the life and times of a group of New York City tragically hip, hapless celebrities that flocked around the elusive, indifferent Warhol like a 'Night of the Living Dead' fashion show. It's a seemingly endless parade of Warhol art, movies and photos which ultimately define the world of Andy Warhol. That his art is a pop culture commercial gimmick is a notion long been put to rest and the seriousness of his work is heralded and applauded here, an artist of the 1960s who chose not to run from rampant commercialism, but to turn and confront it. The names of celebrities captured from Warhol's home movies would read like a Who's Who of pop culture but it's Warhol himself who leaves the most lasting impression, a modest witty genius, a serious artist, and a cultural phenomena 
  This is a mini-encyclopedia of Jewish history beginning about the 17th century. Sachar's main emphasis is on the Jews of Europe. Owing to the large number of topics raised by the author, this review is necessarily limited to consideration of only a few of them.   Sachar presents a nuanced view of the Jewish experience in post-Reformation Europe: "These constructs must be judged in the context of their time, of course. If Jews possessed fewer rights than did their urban Christian neighbors, they also bore fewer obligations and enjoyed more privileges than did Europe's peasant masses."(p. 5).  A moderate amount of attention is devoted to the massive pogroms in 19th century Russia. Based on archival research, Sachar rejects the notion that the pogroms of 1881 had been instigated by the tsarist government (p. 199). However, Sachar believes that Tsar Nicholas II was in fact behind the 600 pogroms that took place in 1905 (p. 295). Sachar also recounts the experience of Mendel Beilis, who had been framed on an accusation of ritual murder (pp. 305-309). Beilis received a considerable amount of international support and was eventually acquitted.  After Poland was partitioned in the late 1700's, the erstwhile Polish Jews of eastern Poland became Russian Jews, as described by Sachar: "All attempts by Jews to participate in municipal government were effectively blocked by their Russian neighbors, on the grounds that the Jews engaged in "parasitical" "exploitative" activities among the surrounding peasants, especially through their control of the liquor trade. The latter charge actually was well founded. Accustomed in Poland to function as middlemen between aristocrats' estates and the countryside, Jews had become proficient in buying up and converting harvested grain and potato crops into mash, and mash into distilled spirits, which resisted the vicissitudes of the weather. The peasantry offered a sure and certain marker for liquor, and the Jews exploited it fully."(p. 54).   During the Russian rule of eastern and central Poland, a Jewish bourgeoisie developed in Congress Poland (pp. 70-71). In time, this pitted Poles against the mostly-Jewish industrialists. Of course, Jewish dominance of commerce also occurred at lower levels. Sachar describes the Polish-Jewish conflicts that became widely known soon after the resurrection of the Polish state: "In the 1920's, too, the government found ways to restrict Jewish economic activity. The rationale was Jewish overcrowding in commerce and the professions. Here, in fact, the statistics bore out the charge. By 1922, Jews comprised 52% of Poland's tradesmen and owned 48% of the nation's retail shops (although most of these were diminutive market stalls). A majority of attorneys in larger cities were Jews, and in medicine the Jewish presence ranked second only to the German."(p. 414). Sachar, however, doesn't put any of the foregoing statistics in context: Jews comprised only 10% of the Polish population.  Sachar elaborates on the role of Jews in Communism. On one hand, he cites Alexander Kerensky, who asserted that 99% of Russian Jews were anti-Bolshevik (p. 334). On the other hand, the very disproportionate number of Jews in Communism is striking. Bearing in mind the fact that Jews comprised a small percentage of the Russian population, one can appreciate Sachar's figures on Jewish Communism (the Zydokomuna). In December 1917, 5 of the 21 members of the Soviet Central Committee were Jews, prompting Sachar to remark: "Never before had so many Jews served in any European cabinet."(p. 327). Sachar believes that Jews were prominent in Soviet Communism no less so than they were in the Communist parties of western Europe. By the early 1920's, Jews in the Soviet Union accounted for 15-20% of delegates to party congresses (p. 330), and comprised an even higher percentage of party technocrats (including mid-level administrators).      Unfortunately, Sachar recycles an old canard from WWII-era Communist propaganda. He repeats the charge (p. 551) that Tadeusz Bor-Komorowski, the head of the Polish Underground Army (AK) and later leader of the Warsaw Uprising, gave an order for the killing of Jewish partisans because of their "banditry" and "Bolshevism." In fact, Bor-Komorowski never ordered the killing of Jews. He did order armed resistance against bands of bandits. This has been twisted, without any supporting evidence, into a supposed veiled order to kill fugitive Jews.  Anyone who has actually lived in formerly-northeast Poland during the German occupation will attest to the fact that banditry, conducted by bands of Poles as well as Jews, was in fact a serious problem. As for partisan action, even non-Communist Jewish partisans eventually became subordinated to the Soviet Union. Owing to the fact that the Soviets progressively came out as enemies of the AK, the Jewish partisans and the AK were also drawn into enmity against each other.  Sachar discusses the reparations for the Holocaust paid out by West Germany (p. 630), including the fact that the reparations cover property losses of the Jews. Those individuals and organizations seeking compensation from Poland for WWII-era property losses are clearly asking the wrong nation for reparations.   
 Having found "American Gods" disjointed and too dark, I'd avoided "Anansi Boys" until recently hearing that it is more in the vein of "Neverwhere."  Indeed, although the book includes a murder, ghosts, deadly supernatural foes, and the most ominous flocking of birds this side of Hitchcock, it's great fun.  The mingling of the macabre and the funny isn't quite up to the level of "Neverwhere," but that deficit is counterbalanced by the themes of family and self-discovery in "Anansi Boys." 
 It didn't take long for me to be pleasantly surprised at the high level of scholarship and clearly presented facts, the sort of writing all too often lacking from this area of history.  As the author notes, many technology historians, military historians, and arms and armor writers propagate continuing myths and assumptions that can't be supported when the facts are examined closely.  Here, Hall does the topic justice and it is clear he did his homework.  The chapter discussing the technology of gunpowder was especially interesting, and supports his case for the reasons firearms developed as they did.  I recommend a trip to the Metropolitan Museum in New York to have a look at their firearms, where many aspects of his discussion will further illuminate the items on display 
 If you're after a spellbinding epic, watch one of the Lord of the Rings movies.  If you're looking for an awesomely campy 80's film, complete with cyclops, fire-mares, and flying sword-frisbees, then this movie is for you.  An awesomely good time, but not something I would ever want to watch alone 
 I've been a long time INXS fan and have seen them in concert few times and they are definitely one of the best rock live bands out there in the past 20 years or so.  I don't know why this album got average reviews because there are very strong songs on this album.  The first song "Show me" is kind of weird, so it can throw people off.  But after that, it is one catchy song after another and the more you listen to it, the more you go "wow!"  I really like "I'm just a man."  I wish they had the single version of "Searching" on here also (it's on their double album collection) because it's more of a catchy song than the smooth funky sound of "Searching" that's on this album.  I have all of their albums and this one is probably my favorite and the one I listen to now.  But as an INXS fan, they have so many great songs over their careers and I love going back and listen to them.  Great band 
 Another awesome full length album by the boys from New York, They have kept the true and real death metal aliv 
 It'd been a long time (a decade or so) since I read this Elizabeth Gaskell classic before I watched the BBC adaptation on DVD and loved it.  Rereading this novel was the best decision I could have made because I hadn't appreciated it then the way I did now.  North and South captures the social divide and how the manufacturing and trading industries were revolutionizing in the 1850s.  Margaret Hale, the daughter of a respectable clergyman, and her family move from the south of England to the industrialized northern town of Milton after her father leaves the church because of his conscience.  Margaret is appalled with Milton and the vulgar, uncouth ways of tradesmen and merchants, whom she also sees as uncivilized and cruel.  However, will she change her mind after she meets and gets to know the dashing Mr. John Thornton?  There are many twists throughout the novel.  I was able to appreciate the romance and building of tension between Margaret and Mr. Thornton now, especially after having watched the BBC miniseries and the wonderful Richard Armitage playing Thornton.  Right now, to me, there are four memorable classic literary heroes -- Mr. Darcy, Heathcliff, Mr. Rochester and now Mr. Thornton.  He is gentler and not as brooding here as he is portrayed in the miniseries, but he is as compelling as I had remembered him.  The last few pages are my favorite, especially this line: "While she sought for this paper, her very heart-pulse was arrested by the tone in which Mr. Thornton spoke.  His voice was hoarse, and trembling with tender passion, as he said: `Margaret.' " What a romantic line and I wish it had been added to the miniseries.  The ending at the train station in the miniseries is wonderful (if a bit anachronistic), but it would have been even better if the aforementioned line had been incorporated into the scene.  All in all, this is one of my favorite Victorian classics.  Elizabeth Gaskell isn't quite as known or as celebrated as Dickens or the Brontes, people who had been big friends of hers, according to her biography, but she was a gifted writer in her own right and her talent shows in this wonderful gem which I will reread again in the not-so-distant future 
 Many reviewers have done a great job at eloquently promoting the principles of this book, I won't try again here.  Suffice it to say that if you are ready to become effective in the Lord's battle against Satan in the spiritual realm, this book may well change your life (Yes, The victory is assured, but the battle still rages.  Satan is serious about taking casulties.  Could there be any doubt?) It is no surprise this book elicited some negative reviews.  To even acknowledge there is a spirtitual battle in the world today in this age of enlightenment is not popular, including in many churches.  But denying we are at war does not change the fact that we are. I sure encourage you to read this book.  We need more warriors in the battle, and less commentators 
 My 2 y/o son loves this CD we listen to it every time we are in the car.  The singer has a nice voice, not irritating like other kids music I've heard so I actually don't mind playing it for my son because it doesn't give me a headache!! 
 This is a great first book to read.  It give basic information and some good first steps to help you balance your chakras 
 Great Bible - easy to use and the kids like it and enjoy the "extras 
 I added this to my daughters groovy collection and she loves it.  This was her number one request for X-Mas.. 
 I develop leaders at a University and I'm always looking for the best books dealing with how to be an effective leader.  This book was so good that I'm going to use it as the main textbook for a class I'm teaching in the fall.    If what we say as leaders is forgotten, then we just wasted everybody's time; therefore, it's of great importance that we ensure our message will stick in the minds of the people we hope to lead.  Malcolm Gladwell talk about this in The Tipping Point, but it was probably the weakest chapter of his book.  Thankfully Made to Stick was able to expand on the Stickiness Factor and did a much better job of illustrating it than Gladwell did.  I strongly disagree with the reviews stating how hard this book was to finish.  I didn't find it draggin on, in fact, I had a hard time putting the book down.  It was very easy to read and had many references to studies much like The Tipping Point, Blink, or Freakonomics.  What made this book better than those is that this book had idea clinics where you could actually practice what they were talking about.  These clinics made this book much more applicabale then the others that I mentioned earlier.    If you're want to make sure that what you say doesn't go in one ear and out the other, this is the best book you can find 
 Mr Dando's songs are unbelievable, let me first say this. Are they represented on this album, why not. To be very technical, "is this actually the very best of the Lemonheads?"  -No. Whoever put the album together left out some serious gems like "Stove", "Down About It", and "Paint."      We serious fans get a little sad when we see our favorite band get cut up like this, but the final result is an album that will definitely rock your socks off, no kidding. Although not everything was put on there, some of these songs represent the best rock songs of the 90's 
 I've seen bits and pieces of this movie on Showtime or Cinemax I believe and I thought it would be good to have if it ever came out on Video. I found a copy here on VHS ... I heard from other reviews that this movie is softcore which I believe, but I have to admit there are a lot of sex scenes like one where this guy gets it on with this girl in front of everyone in a bar place and I liked some of the Lesbian Scenes, but they could've been a lot better. Anyway it's pretty cool of what i've seen so you might check it out. I would buy it if I were you cause it's kind of hard to see this movie on cinemax or showtime 
 I'll say it straight out: As someone with only a casual knowledge of Andy Grove, I didn't expect to be drawn into this book when a friend recommended it to me. But I was, which is a testament to both subject and author. Tedlow doesn't delve deeply into Grove's personal life - at least not after his Hungarian boyhood - but as a historian, he does a nice job of providing context and meaning for Grove's incredible journey and career, from the currents of eastern European history (anti-Semitism, Nazism, Communism) that buffeted his family and shaped his world-view to the rough-and-tumble development of Silicon Valley and the tiny chips that have changed life as we know it. If you're a business exec or techie, I suspect you'll find plenty here that's instructive. But I'm neither, and I still read straight through to the end. Because it turns out that Grove's clear-headed, open-minded and extraordinarily nervy approach to decision-making and crisis is as relevant to life as it is to business or technology - as is amply demonstrated in the enlightening account of Grove's response to the illnesses that have plagued his later years. All in all, a fascinating story well-told 
 I really enjoyed this book.  I found myself empathizing with Darcy from the middle of the book until the end.  A great read 
 Wow, what a shocker this record must have been when it came out. The opening song, a reworking of the lovely "Girl from the North Country" is nothing like the original. Sung as a duet with Johnny Cash, this song, like the rest of the record, is pure out and out country. Country all the way. But that's not necessarily bad. Dylan is great when he does folk, he is great when he does rock and he is great when he does country. I really love the instrumental "Nashville Skyline Rag," which kind of reminds me a bit of "The Cough Song," from Bootleg fame. I play this record an awful lot, usually right after I play JWH, in fact I have those two records on the same playlist on my iPod along with "New Morning." These records, for me at least, are very uplifting. I know back then, maybe a lot of Dylan's fans didn't think so, but I bet they all appreciate them now. I know I sure do 
 This is indispensable reading. No joke

 After 20 years of researching a variety of potentially transformative subjects and theories, I believe this is the most hopeful and significant material I've yet encountered.  I'm especially excited about what this could mean for society.  The connection between personal wellbeing and societal wellbeing is clear, and therefore this material's relevance to human evolution is greater than even the revolutionary models of reality described by quantum physics.  Actually, like most great advancements, it incorporates and builds upon many such related discoveries that preceded it.  In the societal context, Lipton's work implies that current concerns like war, climate change, and peak oil are merely symptoms of a far more basic condition native to the individual and which he identifies.  This high degree of applicability gives it the rare potential to be truly world-changing.  Although its message isn't especially novel among enlightened philosophies (the timeless, interconnected nature of self, wherein thought literally creates reality), the modality it describes is, not to mention the obvious benefit of scientifically demonstrating how the process actually works in people and thus how it might be manipulated for personal growth, which is a first in the many attempts to quantify this idea (including quantum physics!).  More on the how-to techniques can be found in complimentary research called Psych-K being done by an associate of Lipton's, Rob Williams.  In fact, the two are strongest when taken together.  Although I'm not saying Lipton (or Williams) is a messiah, I do believe his work could turn out to be the much-anticipated trigger that will inspire a cascade of spiritual awakening among a sufficiently wide population to successfully inaugurate the next stage in our evolution (before we destroy ourselves, that is).  It will certainly contribute to that effect.  I consider it a large part of a rapidly building crescendo in our understanding of ourselves.  It's clear that modern civilization is in a sink-or-swim race against the clock--on many fronts, rapidly converging--and if we don't redefine ourselves soon we're going to lose that race.  Cultural institutions like government and big business will fight to the death to preserve their outdated and increasingly dangerous practices, since those feed the environment that created and sustains them.  That institutional intransigence--our collective thinking based on how we see ourselves, a la Lipton--is the major cause of these threats to our survival.  And since our institutions are just collective expressions of ourselves, it's up to the individual to transform our culture(s).  That's only logical, since we all know the maxim about change beginning at home.  So far, I see no better, more naturally appealing vision of what we can be--and how to make it happen--than Lipton's.  He's translated a long-respected philosophy into something we can actually incorporate into our lives.  Both his and Williams' information have come on scene at just the right time (or just in the nick of time), but that also means that the time for change is now.  Thankfully, you can't help but be transformed by this material, and Lipton's is the natural starting point 
 Referred by a friend, I read this book. It immidiately attracted my attention. Through practical stories and examples, it brings the dry classic economic theory in life, yet profoundly. After I read this book, my view point get sharp to see how the business work and how to deal with the daily life. Why we struggle to make comparative advantage, how to reward the employees? This book opened my mind in my practice business world, and immediately we feel the inovative change. This is the single book mostly affected my life. A philosophy with Math principle. 
      This is an execellent book. On the downside i'm 72 years old so i should have read this 40 years ago.   The author is clear & it's readable for most anyone.   However i think today's readers may find the material dated, with some cliche's that were probably very "hip" in the mid '60's. Yet today i beleive we can con verese with most anyone & arrive at these type mind games on our own without the need of a therapist.     If i were able to time travel back to the '60s, Woodstock, Timothy Leary,...& read this book with "that" mind-set, i would rate the book 5 big stars 
 Have been waiting for a long time.  Its not her best, but a great combo of work.  And as always the voice of an angel is always soothing to hear. Thanks Shawn 
 Paul Rosa is just too funny!  Although he stretches the bounds of believability so far that it's no wonder he doesn't get a response to many of his "Idiot Letters"  it's totally laugh-out-loud funny.  If you need a good chuckle, this is the book for you 
 Very nice. Like the case did not really need it but others fine 
 As a truly odd individual, I can only fall asleep to the best of horror films... I have to say that this is one the best movies for me to fall asleep to. Let me preface this statement: I'm not making the recommendation to all sleep deprived to watch the new TCM, but it lacks enough emotional involvment early on that I rarly make it to mid-movie before I am peacefully asleep (I will say that waking up to the scary menu music/sound effect is slightly unsettling).  The horror aspect is fun and the old/dirty set is just fine and definitely to my liking. When I do make it through the full movie, I definitely don't feel cheated. As most people will agree, I must watch horror movies at night... unlike most I sleep best to those I know I like enough to buy. Saw kept me awake, but it was not so for Saw II... unfortunate loss of sleep that night. This version of TCM just really solved my insomnia 
 Great blender! I use it daily to make smoothies and it never fails. Powerful motor purees frozen fruits great!! Simple--only two speeds. Easy clean-up 
 This is the book I have been looking for.  I have always liked beans and grains but what to do with them other than tabouli and chili? The recipes are for simple basic food, ingredients that can be found in most supermarkets and I don't need my french dictionary !  I had the Red Lentil Vegetable Stew for supper tonight and it was great! 
 Book #25 in the In Death series. In this book we find Eve confronted with a person from her past.   Trudy Lombard is one of the foster moms who took care of Eve after she is found in Dallas.  Eve doesnt share the happy memories Trudy tries to force on her.  When Eve tells her to get lost she tries to get money from Roarke.  Roarke being Roarke tells her where to go and how to get there.  A few days later Trudy ends up dead.  Eve, ever the professional, puts all efforts into solving her murder. Although I agree with the other reviewers that this mystery was easily solved, that wasn't my major complaint. I gave this story only 4 stars because although it was good I expected so much more.  I really thought we were going to get some answers to some questions from Eve's past.  We really didn't learn anything new.  And to me we should have.  This story is really good, but it lacked some insight for me. 
 This is the first episode where we really see the heart of Tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father. A must see 
 I recieved this product quickly and in the exact condition that was explained and the product itself is exactly what I was expecting as well.  I give five stars for a perfect service and a perfect product 
 Defining objectives and how to succinctly and efficiently get to them has improved my business and business approach. I find I communicate more effectively and actually have more time 
 In The New World Of Welfare, Rebecca Blank (dean of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, University of Michigan) and Ron Haskins (senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a senior consultant at the Annie E. Casey Foundation) effectively collaborate to compile and present an anthology of commentaries by a diverse group of welfare experts, both library and conservative, academic and nonacademic, to examine the political, cultural, and social issues arising from governmental approaches to contemporary welfare reform. The New World Of Welfare is an invaluable and much appreciated contribution to the on-going municipal, state and national debates on efforts to redesign and implement effective welfare and "workfare" programs 
 This is one of the books that I have recently read that I find myself mentioning often to friends in conversation. There are many survival stories included that are riviting and will stay with you long enough that you may find yourself talking about it quite a while after reading the book.  The beginning chapters are a bit long on behavioral psychology and neurology and may not be interesting to some people but I felt it did add to an understanding of what followed next with the individual survival accounts.  If you stay with it the stories of survival and the rational the author gives to the survivors (or victims) strategy is exceptionally interesting throughout the major part of the book.  Why did two young fit hikers disappear and were never found again after taking a well traveled trail in Hawaii?  How did someone survive a fall with a broken leg into a 100 foot deep crevass in the highest mountains of remote Peru and was somehow able to summon the strength and ability to crawl out of a seemingly impossible situation and be rescued?  Why did snowmobilers on their way to find help for their friends that were overtaken by an avalance risk their own lives on a joyride over a similar snowbank that caught their friends?   The author brings you into the mind and thoughts of the people caught up in these situations and gives good explanations to what seems to be puzzeling and irrational behavior.  He also summarizes a list of attitudes and behaviors that may be helpfull to anyone in a daunting situation 
 I found this book very useful in continuing not only my general education but also allowing me to read the better works of all time. I have started a book club to read all the books and discuss them.. 
 Written by Miriam Cohen, a defender of the emotional rights of children, and warmly illustrated by award-winning artist Ronald Himler, First Grade Takes a Test is a book for young children about keeping test-taking in perspective. When a lady from the principal's office brings a test to the first-grade class, the children have some trouble because none of the answers seem quite right. For example, one question says "Rabbits eat: [] lettuce [] dog food [] sandwiches", yet young George can't find "carrots" on the list - and he knows that if rabbits don't eat carrots, their teeth will grow too long and hurt them. When the test is over, Anna Maria goes to a special class because she did very well, which provokes unrest and even name-calling "Dummy!" among the other children. It takes the wisdom of their teacher to put the test results in their proper context. "The test doesn't tell everything. It doesn't tell all the things you can do! You can build things! You can read books! You can make pictures! You have good ideas! And another thing. The test doesn't tell you if you are a kind person who helps your friends. Those are important things." First Grade Takes a Test celebrates the importance of all types of learning - reading and math as well as social skills - and the importance of not reading too much into a rigorous but limited test, especially at a young age. Highly recommended 
 The first time I saw this movie, when it first came out 33 years ago, I left the theater after one hour or so, I was bored and confused, perhaps I was too young for this film. Today I consider the Godfather to be the best movie ever, I'm a fan of the film, I know every character and detail. Of course I seen it a hundreds times, in fact it's hard for me to stop watching it every time I start. In time people who didn't like the Godfather the first time, will probably understand that this move is a masterpiece jn accomplishment, every aspect is perfectly well portrayed. And of course you will also love de Godfather II. So wait a few years and play it again 
 Great way to introduce your child to music w/out going the classical or 'Barney' route 
 "Eternal Treblinka" is a very sobering read. It should be required reading in all high schools and available in all libraries. Charles Patterson's excellent book offers a riveting comparison between our historical and continuing insensitive treatment of animals and the horrific treatment of Jews in the Holocaust.   Part I succinctly lays out important historical information about the influence that the domestication of animals has had on our society and the subsequent devastating impact which that has had, and continues to have, on all concerned: the animals themselves, the humans who feed upon the animals and, last but certainly not least, the entire planet itself.   Part II points out the frightening parallels in the practices and rationalizations utilized in the daily slaughtering of millions of animals in the United States and the slaughtering of millions of Jews and other innocents at the hands of the Germans in the Holocaust. I lack the words to describe the effectiveness of that comparison.   Part III then introduces us to people both Jewish and German whose experiences relating to the Holocaust led them to become advocates on behalf of the animals with the goal of bringing a cessation of animal exploitation in all its many forms. This leaves the reader with a glimmer of hope. But time is running out rapidly and unless our continuing support of this culture of violence against helpless, sentient animals ceases, we as a society, and, indeed, the planet itself are on a crash course with irreversible disaster.   Please read this book and then pass it on. The urgency of its message cannot be over-stressed.  
 It seems difficult to think about the Chronicles of Narnia critically from a literary perspective. I recall being read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe (LWW) by my 2nd grade teacher and being entranced by the story. When I finally purchased the Chronicles set for myself I made it a point to purchase the exact same edition from which I was read. Many people, I'm sure, feel this same sort of bond with the books that seem to transcend critical thinking since they grip our hearts so firmly.  A Reader's Guide Through the Wardrobe: Exploring C.S. Lewis' Classic Story challenges us to take a critical look at the first of the Narnian stories. The authors begin by making it clear in the introduction that this guide should be used after initially reading LWW purely for enjoyment. The rest of the book is divided into two parts. Part One contains 18 chapters following each chapter of LWW.  Part One is called the "Guided Tour." Each chapter introduces some aspect of literary device that Lewis utilized, such as foiling, archetypes, foreshadowing. Throughout the chapters reflective quotes from Lewis and Lewis scholars are interspersed to add insight. There are plenty of scattered study questions as well, all of which are geared toward helping the reader think through the different elements in LWW.  Part Two offers extended background information and follows a more typical book format. Chapter 19 looks at how the Chronicles came to be written. Chapter 20 examines the reception of the series, including a number of criticisms that have been leveled against Lewis. The final chapter outlines the Christian elements in LWW. There is also a brief biography of Lewis and appendix on the order by which to read the series at the end.  For the most part, this book pleasantly surprised me. I wasn't sure what to expect out of a reader's guide, since I haven't read one before. It essentially teaches readers how to think about the book, while leaving what to think about it mostly to the reader. The guide was consistently interesting and insightful into both Lewis and literature in general. The authors compliment each other terrifically- Leland Ryken being a literary specialist and Marjorie Lamp Mead being a Lewis scholar.  The only part of the book that I thought could use improvement was the last chapter on the Christian vision of LWW. While there were some noteworthy points made in it, it didn't seem to have the solid structure and flow of content the rest of the book has. With that only exception, A Reader's Guide Through the Wardrobe is an excellent tool for helping those of us already romantically familiar with Lewis' masterpiece to take our affections to the next level. With the insights from Ryken and Mead, I believe I can now appreciate Narnia, as well as other fictional literature, more profoundly. 
 This is a great book for people who have been to Rome or are going to Rome. However, as with most of Hawthorne's novels, some patience is required. I found that the first half of this book moved along quickly and was, in a word, enchanting. The second half was not quite as engaging and the end seemed somewhat abrupt to me. I almost felt that Hawthorne was in a rush to finish. Not that I didn't enjoy it. I was just left on the last page saying, "What? Where's the rest of the book?" I'll admit it though, I'm a Hawthorne fan and despite it's imperfections this is a worthwhile read and one of my personal favorites 
 Whedon's writing is perfect for the X-Men Universe. His knowledge of and care for the franchise is something Brett Ratner (director of the upcoming X3) could benefit from.  The artwork, especially for Beast, is beautiful and fits the characters well. The evolution of his bestial features is well-done and has interesting implications for the future of Dr. McCoy.  A must-have for any X-men fan 
 This book is so helpful!  While I was reading this book, I would find myself saying outloud "This is so true!"  This book will help you to have a clear understanding about what matters in life, in being the TRUE you, and in focusing on what really matters in life.  This book will help you on your spiritual walk, and in how you see daily life.  Buy this book....it will be one of the best you've ever bought.  This book will direct you in the right direction 
 This book was excellent!!! By far, one of the best that I've read by Suzanne Brockmann. I don't know why people were so put off by the Jules/ Robin story. It was very TASTEFULLY done. This is America. Homosexuality is real, whether we agree with it or not. I recommend this book to just about anyone. It was GREAT!!! 
 We borrowed this book from the library at first. We tried many of the recipes and loved almost all of them and so ended up buying it. We have tried about 8 recipes so far and the only one we haven't enjoyed thoroughly was the long beans with dried shrimp (the dried shrimp was not to our taste-buds liking!).  This book just serves as an intro to the veggies used in asian cooking, giving a brief description for each one. It offers only one or two recipes per veggie. And don't be deceived, this is not a vegetarian book! Most of the recipes have meat! (The braised short ribs with hearts of bok choy was great!)  Very delicious 
 I agree with Alan's review above, the title of this book is very misleading. When I first got this book I was quite disappointed that the designs here are not advanced. In fact, they are too easy to fold for advanced and experianced folders (for me they only ranked at too-easy to intermediate level). But just forget about it and then I find this book contains the richest practical origami models in a single book so far. These wonderful models are collected in the first half of the book. We can learn how to fold a purse, a clip holder, a booknote, a bookmarker, etc. In fact now my clipholder and bookmarker are folded as this book did by myself. In my opinion this part is this book's (true) merit. Models in the latter half are a bit trite and too easy. If you are interested on the practical usage of origami, this is a 5 star book. If not, this is only 3 stars. So take an average, 4 stars ^ 
 This updated (2002) Oxford Companion is probably the best choice if you are looking for a serious reference for the many aspects of musicology AND in-depth biographies of the major and minor composers.  This guide gives about 2-4 full pages of text to "the big guys" like Bach, Beethoven and Liszt and only 1-3 paragraphs to the less influential composers like Biber or Locatelli.  But this will probably not be enough to fully satisfy the more serious student's interest (the multi-volume New Grove Dictionary is the place to go then).  The OCM also gives a few pages each to describing the major eras of music (Renaissance, Baroque etc).  Its descriptions of musical terms (like what is allegro, a sarabande dance, a hurdy gurdy etc) are written in straightforward language but are usually not excessively descriptive.  However, some topics get quite a thorough treatment - such as the many aspects of harmony and sound - so the OCM is certainly not any "lightweight" reference. Of course, it all reads in the tone of an encyclopedia and thus does not really make captivating reading for the non-music major.  Other guides to classical music are better at introducing musicology to the newby, such as the NPR Encyclopedia or David Dubal's compelling "Essential Cannon of Classical Music."  But, if you are a more serious music student or listener with a greater interest for in-depth musicology (and already have enough references on the lives of the composers), then the Harvard Music Dictionary is probably the top choice.  It is pure musicology (with the composer biographies in a separate, companion volume).  As a result of such focus, the Harvard Dictionary has more space for more detailed treatment of each music topic.  It is slightly more technical in nature (superb graphs, charts) and academic in its writing compared to the Oxford Companion.  But, either one is excellent and can be had on Amazon marketplace used for about 1/3 the list price 
 The book is good. The crust instructions are great. The author recommends 2 tbsp of starch for berries pies. I made four blackberry pies with two and more tbsp of starch, and it was still runny, fool of juices on the botton, doesn't matter how long you bake. There is no way it would work. I was dissapointed until found  blackberry pie recipe on allrecipes.com with only 4 reviews, and it was the best berry pie I ever had. Add 3 to 4 Tbsps of tapioca instead to all her recipes. Also she recommends to add 2 tsp of lemon zest. I add a pich, and it was very much enough. The author says that she tried most of her recipes fo up to 50 times. In other words: it is not a bible at all, take it as a bse and experiment yourself. Otherwise it has many interesting recipes, will try. 
 This book is a great resource to use when teaching a unit about Map Skills!  I've used this in my 2nd grade classroom and it was successful!  The language is very child-friendly and easy to understand!  The illustrations are wonderful!  A great addition to my Map Skills unit 
 This is a great product.  My son received it for X-mas this year and it is the most excited I have ever seen him.  My husband did all the experiments with him, but he did the actual work.  He cannot spell yet, but drew pictures off what he did and what happened.  After he did all the tests, he rounded up all his friends to show him what he did and how.  They especially loved the snow.  I would recommend this product as a very good first science kit.  Now, I need to find more 
 I read the books years ago. Probably I may have been in school then. But the book still has a great impact on my life. The orphan childhood of Tom, his relationship with his Aunt. His adventures with his friends especially with Huck Finn on whom another book has been written about. I think such a book would really be enjoyed by kids of 13 years and younger. This has and will always be one of my best books ever. 
 Michael Crichton's book PREY puts a spin on where nanotechnology could take us in the near future. When a swarm of nanobots changes it's own directive, the Nevada desert becomes a dangerous place to be.    Julia works at the Nevada nanotechnology facility and becomes so involved in her work that she hardly spends any time at home. Her husband Jack thinks she may be having an affair when he notices that her behavior is changing. Jack has no clue her behavioral changes stem from something much more sinister.   PREY is science fiction meets psychological thriller. In this story, just when you think you know who the bad guy is, the tables are turned. The fast-paced action keeps your heart pumping. Like his other novels, Crichton makes the highly improbable seem factual. Once I started this book it didn't leave my hands until the last page 
 "Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the King that led them to it."  Particularly poignant poetry in these times of pompous presidential sabre rattling and wars based on questionable facts 
 I started reading this book with a low expectation but surprisingly I liked the book when I finished it !. Though it doesn't explain the statistical methods in great detail, its still a good reading for logistics regression based scorecard development. SAS is frequently referred in the text so it's easy for a SAS user.  The chapters I thought useful:  If the reader is not very familiar with US credit bureau data, Chapter 3 gives a good summary and explains the basic structure of the bureau file its importance to consumer finance.   Chapter 4- Scorecard development, Elizabeth Mays describes step by step how a scorecard is developed using logistics regression. More importantly, those who wondered how the final points (say a FICO of 580) arrived at, scaling and assignment of point weights to attributes  are specifically discussed .  Chapter 5 - Variable analysis and Reduction details the information value calculations and commonly used variable reduction methods .  Chapter 13- Scorecard Monitoring Reports describes how to track them using front end and back end reporting. Though this chapter reads exactly like a FICO article on the same subject, its a good reading.   Overall, it does not have the disadvantage many people writing. Depth of some chapters is below expectation - for example Chapter 8 Score based loss forecasting.   I recommend this for anyone in consumer lending business. esp the beginning analysts.  Also check with my site [...] for my recent readings. 
 Best investment I have made in years ! The book is clear, detailed and complete. I recommend it to anyone interested in volatilty models 
 A short but engaging tale-I literally could not put it down. It was a wonderfully written tale, rich with detail and humor 
 All the reviews in audio specialty magazine are correct.  This is a wonderful performance and a spectacular recording.  The depth of instrumentation and voices across the entire stereo stage is breathtaking.  If you synthesize surround sound in your system, you will be amazed at the concert hall ambience you will hear.  You will be envolped in a world class performance.  Buy this CD.  You will be thrilled 
 I have found that this book contains almost every cookie recipie you could ever need.  Most of the old favorites and basics are here.  There is a large "do it yourself" section for bar cookies--suggestions/recipies for a range of crusts and fillings.  BEST OF ALL there is a color photo of the finished cookie next to each recipie. (So you can have an idea of what it should look like.)  The negative side of this book is that the author uses names that might not be familiar.  I just used a bunch of postits and tagged the pages with the names I use.  Buy it 
 I picked this up because I think I may have been the only person who really liked the original Underworld film, and I'm a sucker for vampire tales.  Books made from films are always risky.  It's hard to pack good righting into a novel hat must depend on a high action film for its entire plot.  And that's what happened here.  The story picks up right after the first film, with Selene (our vampire) and Michael (now a vampire/werewolf hybrid) in flight from just about every supernatural creature you can imagine.  They've done away with an elder werewolf , an elder vampire, and thrown the worlds of coven and clan into chaos.  Very Bad Karma.  The majority of the story is one long flight from hiding places to safe houses and back again.  Worse, some new players have entered the plot.  Marc, who should have been the last vampire elder [and actually should also have found final death], is inadvertently resurrected by exposure to blood that make him a hybrid too.  Only he really can turn into a bat and fly.  And rip whole building to shreds.  The transformed elder makes Michael look like a crosswalk guide.  The other new player is Alexander Corvinus, who heads an organization which has been cleaning up after the public relations disasters of the occult set.  Suffice it to say that he is not a sanitation engineer, and he plays a key part in making the story work.  Prepare for one long, running vampire fight with occasional stops for the history of these occult creatures.  The writing is crisp, and lacks the overblown exclamations that other writers have used to cover up a lack of dialog or action.  And yes, there is a lot of violence in the tale -- everyone in this book is a killer of one sort or another, and Greg Cox doesn't flint from pointing this out to the gaping reader.  No, this isn't great literature, or even great vampire fiction, but it's an entertaining romp in the fields of night. 
 Have always liked Tom Jones but had never bought any of his early work. The songs are great and the sound quality is really top notch. There are few true stylists like Jones left. When you hear him there is no doubt who you are listening too 
  The Book of Secrets is one of Loreena McKennitt's finest efforts, but I've read that some people don't hold it in high regard.  I find that baffling - a mystery of secrets one might say.  Critics have called McKennitt pretentious, but I'm not sure pretentious is the right word to describe the sovereign of World Music.    Explaining (in Words and Music) the drive behind such impressive projects as The Book of Secrets, The Mask and Mirror, The Visit, or Parallel Dreams does not make her pompous or conceited - it makes her accessible like no other performing artist in her field.    Often using natural instruments existing in the observable world; neither supernatural nor magical, her work - if not supernatural - it is indeed magical to hear.    McKennitt's projects are filled with diverse instruments, which function together as if all of them were authentic period instruments meant to be played together.  Strangely, though, some of those who comprise her studio band are Jazz, Blues, Classical, and Rock and Roll musicians.  Then, McKennitt puts them all together with such world artists as Hossam Ramzy, and we get a masterpiece.  However, with a complex story to tell from beginning to end in music form, it does take some explaining for people interested in similar ideas inferred or derived from specific instances surrounding her musical philosophy.  Her relevant descriptions help the listener understand what goes on between a prologue and a finale.   Often people misunderstand her efforts to explain her musical journey (and perhaps ours) through life.  Yet, I love her unscripted interviews for their insight - their texture, or the essential quality of her musical patterns.  They are very much tactile, rather than vague and distant.  There are so many esoteric artists in the music business that Loreena McKennitt is as accessible as a fine bottle of Chï¿½teauneuf du Pape - the most famous Cï¿½tes du Rhï¿½ne wine.  Thus, Loreena McKennitt's Words and Music interviews are paramount to understanding her as a musician, storyteller, and songwriter, as well as each recording project she decides to engage in.  Her storytelling brings the world into ones living room in a brilliantly colorful and thoughtful manner.  Call it slush if you like, but I believe Loreena McKennitt understands to be a musician doesn't mean one should become famous, make hordes of money, and  then run for the hills to live happily in luxury.  Most musicians know they are here to interpret music until the day before they die - as Mitsuko Uchida (the grand Dame of classical piano) said so eloquently about musicians in general.  She is right.  In addition, anyone who knows Loreena McKennitt's philanthropic concerns understands she puts whatever her assets are to work in many areas of the world.  She gives back to many communities like no other single musician I know.  Where disadvantaged people, poor children, ALS victims, disaster victims, the environment, Water Search and Safety, Tolerance, Peace, and many other causes, are in desperate need of help, education, and supplies, Loreena McKennitt is at the forefront.    I cannot wait for An Ancient Muse to be released after nearly eight years of no studio music from Loreena McKennitt.  However, she's been a busy girl Loreena has since the release of The Book of Secrets. Each day, her philanthropic work saves someone's life.   Lastly, I would be careless if I didn't say, without her contributions to music over the years, the music world would be a rather boring place, which is why The Book of Secrets isn't a boring place to be.  It is far better to listen to The Book of Secrets than watch the 6 o'clock news - that is why I find Loreena McKennitt's music thoroughly enjoyable. 
 I'm not a writer, but after reading this book I am much more aware of some of the fascinating subtleties in good writing.  Highly recommended 
 This film actually reminded me of family ...  I had to take a call and missed the last 30 min.  The next day I went back and was able to catch it all the way through.  This is one of those rare films you can actually watch and enjoy twice.  It has one of the scariest car chases I have ever seen.  Diane Keaton does a lovely job playing a most difficult character.  I happen to like all of the actors in this film.  It was kind of like dear friends getting together and finding something fun to play with.  The comic timing is well executed and there were a lot of places that just cracked me up ... and I wasn't the only one laughing.  Is this Oscar material, who cares, this was really fun to watch 
 This excellent review cover all the main areas of anatomic pathology. Most of the questions feature color photographs. The answers provide complete and clear explanations using up to date textbook and journal references. I would recommend this book to anyone preparing for the anatomic pathology board or the resident in-service examination 
 We received one of these for Christmas and we can't stop using it.  This skillet heats up fast, is a great size for anything and absolutely nothing sticks to it!  It is perfect for making breakfasts which is why we are registering for another one for our upcoming wedding, that way everything we're making is all ready at the same time.  It also doubles as a buffet server which is always handy for entertaining.  I highly recommend one of these 
 It is hard not to rate this Bill Evans CD as anything less than superb; right up there with the Vanguard series 
 I started seriously listening to lounge music earlier this year and I highly recommend this album. Very easy to listen to over and over again. I've been listening to it in the car as I drive around Berlin and it is just perfect 
 The only surprise to this book is that it was no surprise. In fact, the idea that Messers. Reagan and Bush, assisted by a cabal of shadow dwellers, would manipulate a democractic vote is now common. The whole affair, meticulously documented in this important book, is put in sharper relief by the recent revelation that Richard Nixon sent Henry Kissinger to Paris to pull a similar stunt, for an identical purpose, in the fall of 1968.  Disgraceful. This book should be read in every classroom in America 
 I planned my last trip to Italy around this book. Fred in one hand, an atlas of Italy in another. His insights into regional food kept us true to the places we visited (Liguria, Tuscany, Umbria, along the Adriatic coast, and Emiglia Romana), and served as a magical gustatory compass. We had five of our top-ten-EVER meals on that trip, with very few splurges. We're going to France in three weeks and have lamented over and over that this book doesn't have a French counterpart. If only he had a Francophile twin 
 I always love Iris Johansens books be it a romance or mystery. 
 I recently got these dolls and u are not able 2 put them down! I have mine beside my computer as i write this...I think that the hightlight here is lilani. It says "bratz -kidz- sisters" so i think that the bratz kidz is the  one ull be holding on to 4 the rest of ur life. u will want to bring them to school and change their clothes alot...I recomend these to any one...25.00$ if ur gonna buy 1 fashion pack 4 each girl than ur lookin at around 40.00$ 
 I have read this book many times and as an educator I can not say enough good things about the book.  "The Patchwork Quilt" has great  illustrations, touches on multiculturalism b/c of the people included in  the story, does not exclude other cultures b/c the book is also about  family, confronts dealing with death in a healthy manner, and is easily a  lead-in to an art lesson. This book can lead to discussions on family,  death, and classroom community (each student makes a patch representing  themself and bind them together to make a classroom quilt)!  :)  Have fun  and educate with this book 
 I bought the audio version of Keith and Dan's book in addition to the  printed version. While the book contains a lot more material than the  tapes, it's great to listen to Keith and Dan banter back and forth for  three hours. Take this one in the car with you on long trips--it will  definitely make the trip more interesting. This ia a must-have for any true  Olbermaniac (like myself. 
 Smoky is a fine story with many layers. Having read it as a youth, it now is a favorite of my children 
 Ok, the question is: since this is only a STEREO DVD audio, would you need to upgrade, if you own the CD already?. The answer is YES, for TWO reasons.  1) We haven't been favored with a REMASTERED version of the Parsons catalog (with the exception of the first record, 'Tales of mystery and imagination'). The GREATEST HITS package did improved the songs through remastering, but the individual CD's, like this one, are still as they were first released almost 20 years ago. So little attention has been put on them by the record company, that it was really a miracle that these records were released as CD's at all. 2) Even the remastered version wouldn't compete with the final product contained in this DVD Audio. Since it's a DVD, it's meant to bring a higher quality of sound than the CD could ever possible deliver. This DVD is double sided. One side plays on DVD AUDIO players, the other on normal DVD players. If you don't know the difference, it's just that originally, the DVD AUDIO was designed as a special product to be played by specific players that could read a higher standard of audio, just like Super Audio CD's are designed to be played by special players. To hear the quality of this DVD (or any other DVD audio available) at its best, you'd need a DVD AUDIO player. You'd notice that the improvement is amazing. The sound is clearer. The treble is polished, the bass and drums enhanced (David Patton must be very happy that his bass is more distinguishable here). The overall effect is a sharper and fuller sound that you won't ever be able to get from a CD. If you own a conventional DVD player, the effect will be of a lesser quality, but still a great improvement over the conventional CD sound. Both sides present PCM stereo sound (not encoded Dolby Digital) which ensures a purer, unaltered sound. That it's not multi channel might be a put down for some, but I guess that would be only for those who haven't had a chance to ever hear how a stereo DVD sounds. Whatever, it's what's available now, until something better comes out, if ever. Unlike other DVD Audio's available, the format of this one is very simple, not including videos or special materials, just a screen showing the song that it's being played. The booklet includes the lyrics and original information of the album, spread in 8 colored pages, more faithful to the original LP album art. As simple as it is, it's more presentable than the one page booklet that originally accompanied the CD. NOTE: in this DVD AUDIO format, "Turn of a friendly card" and "Eye in the sky" were also issued 
 Without a doubt one of the best of all possible albums to begin your trip to Boz.  First track is s shocker: a 1925 acoustic recording of the Boswell Sisters first side. Consider that Vet, on the high voice, is all of 14 years old at the time - and that there were no retakes, balance, or even microphones as we know them now (they sang into little horns). Ride through this rough and tumble little ditty (complete with the Boswell's own personal language called "gibberish") and say to yourself "this is great for historical context but I bet it gets better".  And Lordy does it ever. The next track is "Heebie Jeebies", a Satchmo number that gets the Boswell tempo treatment and gives you your first exposure to the strutting contralto of Connie Boswell. This was their lucky song and you'll be feeling lucky to have bought this CD around this time.  If you had any doubt that you were about to have a great musical romp, add the Dorsey Brothers on "When I take My Sugar to Tea" and just strap yourself in. Don't be lulled into thinking you've hit a sentimental sappy in "Shine on Harvest Moon" as you ride through a chorus and verse straight and sweet as southern tea. Suddenly the Sisters break out the juice, change the tempo, throw out the melody and race toward the finish line. And baby, you are the winner.  If you don't feel like marching in a Mardi Gras parade after "We Got to Put the Sun Back in the Sky" you need a tonic.  And if by "Old Yazoo"  you feel like you just went through all of Mardi Gras in 3-minutes - you've been Bozzed.   Not to worry. Your blood pressure will come down and your heart be rocked in the cradle of Southern loveliness by the time the CD comes to an end on "Dinah".  This is a superlative CD for the music afficianado who wants to dip into the refreshing, innovative and utterly joyful noise of the Boswell Sisters. Their incomparable sound shines here, and you are treated to some of the best jazzmen of the 30s like Bunny Berrigan, Joe Tarto, Joe Venutti, Eddy Lang and Manny Klein in what feels sometimes like one of the bestest, baddest jams in late night New York history.  John Lucas may have said it best in the October 15, 1944 cover story of Down Beat when he said of the Boswell Sisters "Since they were kids they've been singing licks instead of lyrics, and riffs in place of rhymes."  Get Bozzed 
 Richard Peck has again done his usual fine job of depicting what life was like for children in another era. The story takes a variety of twists and turns that keep even adult readers amused and entertained. As a librarian who is interested in how librarians have been, and are, portrayed in children's literature, I found this a worthy addition to the genre. At the time in the early 20th century that Here Lies the Librarian is set, librarianship had become a female profession but was showing signs of undergoing dramatic changes. Peck's former librarian Electra Deitz, who has died shortly before the story opens, was definitely of the old-fashion strict and forbidding kind. His new young female library school graduates are definitely of a different persuasion not only in terms of making the public library accessible and welcoming to users of all ages but also in their every day life. Kids and librarians should enjoy Peck's latest addition to his string of books that are fun to read 
 I'm a cat lover to bgin with, so this might come out sounding more than a touch biased. My first exposure to ML was Cat in a Jeweled Jumpsuit. I enthusiastically reccomend it, it's got the King, it's got Las Vegas, it's a mystery and most of all it's got Midnight Louie! I have since gone on to read Catnap, Pussyfoot, Cat on a Blue Monday and Cat in a Flamingo Fedora, which is notable for the climactic abduction and forced vasectomy of our hero ML. A damn shame that, since in her debut in Cat on a Blue Monday, Louie's long-lost daughter Midnight Louise alias Caviar, revealed her lack of desire for motherhood and breeding. If only the family line could be contiuned! we all need more such cats as Midnight Louie, to say nothing of Temble Barr's need as  well as that of Las Vegas in general. My basic point, do yourself a big favor and start collecting the ML series today!! Talk about being worth every penny. I'd gladly grab up every title myself if I ever hit the Lotto jackpot 
 This book truly shows the beginnings of Air Power theories. This book was written in an attempt to talk the Italian government into using Airpower as a new weapon. Douhet initially failed in this venture, but the Italians  later realized their mistake. While the views and opinions of Douhet are at  times extremely different from airpower today, and may seem a little  ridiculous, this is certainly excellent reading for those who wish to begin  learning about the origins of airpower theory 
 This novel contains some of the most compelling images I have ever read.  It is a measure of Patchen's courage that he wrote it at the height of WWII--not a popular time for anti-war activism. The depth of his thinking  about pacifism emerges in this novel on every level. Patchen was a lifelong  scholar and student of the works of William Blake and it shows:  "Moonlight" challenges us not only in content but in form as  well, using metaphor and image to create a powerful non-linear world of  story and thought. Kenneth Patchen's work is beginning to experience a  resurgence, and I would suggest buying this novel (along with Kenneth's  love poetry) if you want to discover this great American poet 
 As a parent of four grown sons, I found this a very entertaining and accurate view of the 26 child rearing years I spent at home with my sons.  So I bought this book for my son and his wife who are raising twins, a boy and a girl.   The bumper sticker in the back of the book is a nice bonus: "Driving under the influence of children" How true!!! 
 I believe that this is a terrific book to get before your cruise.  It helped us make the most of our trip 
 This book offers an in-depth analysis of the visual dynamics in a piece of art according to the sizes, positions, orientations and the balancing centers of its components. Paintings, sculptures and architectures are the  subjects of discussions in the book. In addition to the balance between the  components of a piece of art, the shape of a picture frame, the  environment, the perspective prescribed by the artist and the viewer all  play an important role in the interpretation of a piece art. The author  takes an step-by-step approach to explain how the understanding of the  roles of all these elements would help us to appreciate a piece of art.  Many examples, modern and classical, are provided to demonstrate his  points. I find his approach to understanding a piece of art interesting and  revealing. This is one of the best books I ever read about arts. I think  this book would benefit aspiring artists and art enthusiasts alike. I would  hane given it five stars instead of four and a half if the pictures in the  book were in color 
                 Night hoops is the second best book on the planet,the first is Asphalt God.This book is awsome because it is about basketball the best sport on the planet.That is why you should read this book 
 I first read this novel as an undergraduate after watching the Bill Murray movie.  I distinctly remember purchasing the book that evening and reading it in one sitting.  It spoke to me in many levels those many years ago and it continues to do so everytime I re-read it even now.  This novel is truly great, easy to read, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a fulfilling read 
 Paul Hunt has given everyone interested in hiking within Japan an excellent source for information! His selection of walks within the book is from basic to advanced, all producing fantastic scenery and something of  the essence of living/hiking in Japan. There is a walk for everyone within  this very handy and well-researched book. Even though it may seem out of  date (being 10 years old now), it is not. The information is still  extremely accurate. I have used his book for my own hiking and for a hiking  club I started in Japan - the TSUKUBA WALKING AND MOUNTAINEERING CLUB.  If you are coming or in Japan already, and are interested in hiking, then I`d  recommend for you to buy this book 
 I've been a fan of Samurai Champloo for a while now, so I kinda knew what to expect from the soundtrack. It's great to hear the full length songs, when on the show, you only get a 10- 15 sec. snippet. I do live sound in a Jazz club, and play the soundtrack during set breaks, and all the time people are asking me what I'm playing. If you like "chill out" or downtempo I would highly recommend it 
 Everyone, one way or another. Everyone except maybe Marlowe.  This isn't one of Chandler's better-known stories; as far as I know, it was never made into a movie. Maybe it's just a little too complex for a movie. It starts in the usual way. A young woman, beautiful (if she lets herself be) and in trouble, asks private detective Marlowe for help. She needs to find her brother, a small-town boy who's lost his way in the big bad city.  She's not quite what she claims to be, though, and the brother isn't what he should have been. As the story progresses, Hollywood and all the people in it lose their shine, and get darker and dirtier. And the bodies start to pile up ---  Maybe Chandler didn't invent American noir of the post-WWII era, but he certainly made it his own. If you liked 'The Big Sleep' and 'The Long Goodbye', you're sure to like this as well.  //wiredweir 
 I have seen many historical war dramas from Far East (mainly China's) and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy.  Yi Soon Shin, however, is a rare exception.  Not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in-fighting between the Chosun political factions (and the second-guessing nature of the king) which causes his eventual death.     Also, the special effects are great.  The battle scenes (whether on sea or land) are realisitic and of outstanding quality.  The only problem that I can find is that the DVD has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the Ming China.  Then again, this is not unexpected since this is a Korean drama focusing on the great admiral.  Also, the entire selection should have 104 episodes.  I don't know why it stops at 101.  If you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject, try Samuel Hawley's Imjin War (which portrays Yi Soon Shin more accurately by quoting original sources).  Any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out Stephen Turnbull's Samurai Invasion (which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the Japanese perspective).    Lastly, anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out Shogun:Total War by Creative Assembly (now in Gold version). 
 Joe D'Amato's masterpiece Anthropophagus is both one of the finest and the least appreciated of the Italian Horror Golden Age. D'Amato had already established himself as the master of raw gore in Blue Holocaust (aka Beyond the Darkness aka Buried Alive), and the snuff movie footage in Emmanuelle in America (the inspiration for Videodrome). In his entry into the slasher genre, he enriches Anthropophagus with a steady build-up of layered atmosphere until he has recreated the old dark castle effect of the classic Universal monster movies of the 30s. Then he lets the blood flood. Released butchered in the states as Grim Reaper, this version is uncut and contains the films two highmarks: the scene where a fetus is pulled out of a pregnant woman and eaten, as well as the pull out your fingernails climax where cannibalism is taken to it's most extreme. Most haunting is the flashback explaining where the flesheater came from, it makes your stomach drop. This movie establishes D'Amato in the ranks of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci as one of the masters of the spagetti nightmare. 
 There is no dearth of literature on Thomas Jefferson.there are numerous books that offer detailed studies on various aspects of his life, political theory and his career. This book is obviously a brief account of the life and career of Thomas Jefferson. As such, it compromises on a detailed discussion on any one aspect of Jefferson's life, but this is understandable, given the limited scope of the book. Even so the discussion on Jefferson's presidency is a little too brief. However certain topics-such as the Emabargo, are handled fairly well. overall, this book is usefull to anyone who wishes to obtain a bird's eye view of Jefferson's life 
 Save yourself at least a year of back testing strategies using tradestation and collecting statistics.  This book is an encyclopedia, not a "psychological" trading type book.  This is dry and technical information, statistics, numbers, etc.  I wouldnt have it any other way.  Make sure you have a trading platform that will allow you to put this information to good work.  This book is a must 
 It is exactly what I ordered.  I really should have ordered the 88 notes keyboard but did not know it at the time.  Not Yamaha's fault 
 In reviewing this collection, some people have said things along the lines of "this isn't the 80s I remember".  Well, the 80s you remember SUCK! The 80s are probably my least favorite decade musically of the past 50/60 years or so, but this collection still managed to find the good songs. No Billy Idol, no Bangles, no Tears For Fears. Thank goodness 
 I must have read this book cover to cover 2-3 times and each time it opens new doors to the big fish world. From big swimbaits to throwing a jig, the information past on to the reader through the book,  "Big Bass Zone" is a must for any fisherman who wants to catch bigger fish. 
 Li-Young Lee's latest collection once again shows what a phenomenal poet he is. While not quite as good as his first collection, _Rose_ (which is one of the better first books i've seen), it comes close. Lee has a lyricism and depth that continues to raise the bar for contemporary poets. The central theme of the mythic-hero father that was in Lee's first collection does not dominate this latest collection. Instead, we have poems that try to understand origins from both the father and the mother. _Book of My Nights_ is another poetry collection that deserves to be on your shelf 
 This book was almost impossible to put down. Every page was a new twist or adventure that kept me reading to see what would happen next. 
 I was long overdue in finally - FINALLY! - reading this book after hearing so much about it! Living in the Nashville area, I remember reading in our newspaper several years ago about this local nurse whose debut novel created a bidding war among the Big Dog publishing houses. But it wasn't until just recently that I came across JULIE & ROMEO and realized what all that fuss was about! WOW!!! Jeanne Ray is such a breath of fresh air! It absolutely blows me away that this is a debut novel - it's MUCH too good! After reading it, I immediately got all the rest of Ray's books, DEVOURED them, and now I'm anxiously awaiting whatever's next. Just please tell me another one is on the way!?   One of the things I love most about Jeanne Ray's books is her quirky middle-aged characters. In a world overdosing on Britneys, Lindseys, and Paris Hiltons, GLORY it's nice to find the kind of people you'd actually like to know. They're flawed, down-to-earth, and way too much fun getting to know! There aren't many books out there that can make me laugh out loud, but all of hers do.   I am THRILLED to discover this relatively new author and I can't wait to have a whole shelf filled with Jeanne Ray books! Bring 'em on 
 Oddly enough, I stumbled upon Marvin Pontiac in January while reading Elmore Leonard's "Tishomingo Blues".  In the book, fictional character Robert Taylor plays  "guess that tune" with another character in the book.  The tune in the novel is "I'm a Doggy" which, according to the novel, purportedly was recorded in 1952 and soon became a minor hit.  In the novel, Robert Taylor reports that Mr. Pontiac only recorded one album during his career and only after the producer agreed to mow Pontiac's lawn.  Other accounts of Mr. Pontiac life are just as mysterious.  Some say he went insane after claiming to have been abducted and probed by aliens and he died in 1970 at the Esmerelda State Mental Institution in Detroit.  Other accounts report that he was hit and killed by a bus in June of 1977.  All in all, his life and death is probably the biggest sham since the "Paul Is Dead" rumors and clues circulated in the 70's.  Careful attention to the liner notes reveals that Pontiac is, in fact nothing more than, the alter ego of John Lurie. Most notably, the lone recording of Pontiac appears on Lurie's label, "Strange & Beautiful" which did not exist in 1952 when Pontiac purportedly recorded and released "I'm A Doggy".  Moreover, the CD features musicians that include Lurie's brother Evan, John Medeski and Marc Ribot who would have been infants at the time of the actual 1952 recording.  Finally, this CD was recorded in 2000, 30 years after the latest purported death of Pontiac.  Are these the vocals of a dead man or just Lurie having a little fun? I suspect it's the latter.  Whatever the reason for the deception, the CD itself is delightful to listen to.  It features an array of styles from back porch blues to lounge lizard jazz.  All complimented with Lurie's Barry White styled vocals.  Alter ego's aside, this is a fine production by Lurie.  I am just sorry that Lurie buried Pontiac without recording a sequel. Buy it and contemplate the mystery while you enjoy the music 
 What a great little book!  Based on a series of History Minutes developed to air on The History Channel, every two-page spread of this little gem provides a short, easy-to-read and very interesting story-behind-the-story that most of us don't know.  The most interesting of these 100 brief stories are those in which one decision by one person ended up changing history and life as we know it, even today.  Some of those include: * Lost in Translation - where a poor word choice caused the first use of the atom bomb. * BA-BUMP Goes the Stethoscope - about the doctor who invented it out of modesty. * Cooking With Radar - about the invention of the microwave oven.  But the mix of story themes also keeps this book interesting, including insights into people we know by name without knowing much about them, like Proctor and Gamble, John Harvey Kellogg, Lionel of Lionel Trains fame, James Bond, and many more.  I also enjoyed it because it's easy to read 2 or 3 stories during lunch or just before dozing off at night.  And, at the risk of sounding like a commercial, it's a great gift for kids who love to read because they'll have the inside scoop on many, many popular cutlure stories that their friends (and often teachers) won't know.  Enjoy 
 N-Space and its Companion Playgrounds of the Mind form a wonderful  retrospective of the carrer of one of the best science fiction writers.  N-Space provides a selection of short stories, especially ones that have  not yet appeared in book form, and have been hard to find. It also provides  some of his better stories, and gives essays, gossip, and a view into the  world of a Science Fiction writer. You really come away knowing Larry  Niven, the man, along with a better understading of his fiction. You get  some very interesting factiods (did you know that the Kzinti are in Star  Trek? neither did I!), and lots of enjoyment, from never read short  stories, to anecdotes about your favorite Niven Novel, an unbeatable  bargain. N-Space is a great introduction to the various works of Larry  Niven (and sometimes co-author in crime Dr. Jerry Pournelle), as well as a  great resourse for those who would like to learn more about what they have  read and known for years. I rarely give the 5 out of 5 rating, but I have  no hesitations here. Highest Reccomendation 
 The Fifth of March was a great read by Ann Rinaldi. The book is an excellent reference for the Boston Massacre. The characters make the book feel like you are part of the rabble, or like Rachel, torn apart, confused to what side you are on. Ann Rinaldi is an excellent writter, she makes the story come to life 
 For a long time Revancha was my favorite CD and I just couldn't believe that a follow up album could be as good. Well, Gotan Project did it! 
 This is a good book, and one worth reading.  It's not a history book nor a work of political philosophy.  The analysis isn't rigrously done.  I don't say these things as criticisms, but rather to point out what sort of book it is.  It's a book of essays that provide a particular picture of what life was like in the early 90's in post-communist Eastern and Central Europe.  Many times these pictures are insightful and can help throw light on a situaiton.  They can help provide that "ah-ha!" moment that is sometimes lacking from a more historical or analytic account.  So, it fills a good roll that way, but you should not expect it to be something it's not.  My only other criticism is that sometimes it got a bit too close to the "why are we eastern europeans so dumb?" mode for my taste.  But, it's an enjoyable book that would be useful for anyone with an interest in post-communist eastern europe.  For those who want a deeper view of how Eastern Europe got to be how it was when the Soviet Union fell, I'd recommend reading this book together with parts of Alec Nove's terrific _The Economics of Feasible Socialism_ 
 What a treat! Especially if you listen to the author read the tale, with  that expressive drawl. And the characters--Mrs. Elner Shimfissel is a gem, reminiscent of Arsnic and Old Lace. A story that reminded me that people still laugh and love, almost forgot that.  
 Chevely: "Sometimes. But it is such a difficult pose to keep up."  Perhaps not so well known as "The Importance of Being Earnest," this has all the same banter, manners, and sharp-eyed look at the crumbling edge of the upper crust in Vistorian England. It pleases the attentive listener at many levels. Considered only as a stream of one-liners and clever quips, it delivers all you could ask for.   But because it's Wilde, it's also a wild tirade against the mannered (sometimes ill-mannered) gentry. Behind that, it has a good deal to say about tolerance for the flaws of any fallible human - and Wilde could speak on human flaws with rare authority. And, like any truly great work, its examination of honesty (and dis-) reveals a good bit about today's world, a century later.  I'm not normally a reader of plays. I don't have that inner ear that brings words on the page to life. Wilde gives me some idea what that experience must be like, and I'm grateful for it.  //wiredweir 
 This book is great for children. It was my little sister'sfavorite for years 
 This is a great collection of basic Heinlein SciFi. The title story is about basic jealousy surrounded by miscommunication and the physics of living on the moon. The other stories explore similar kinds of territory. Recommended for exploring concepts of the future and odd bits of probability 
 This book is an awesome very entertaining, thought provoking and inspiring piece of fiction that I highly recommend for some enjoyable clean fresh summer reading.  A must feel good novel for everyones reading list 
 Sticks is a breathtaking story from Joan Bauer. This realistic fiction from Joan Bauer is a book is a book you can't put down. Wham! At the pool table Mickey Vernon is using his blinders and tries to shoot the nine ball. Mickey is ten years old and has brown hair. His smooth skin has freckles and his hand has many band-aids. In Cruckston New Jersey is where Mickey lives. You can tell by reading the story it is nowadays. The Vernon's pool hall is having a pool championship. If somebody wins the pool champion then that person will get a red shirt. To win that red shirt, Mickey has to beat Buck Pender. He is a real bully and also he is a tough pool player. Joesph Alveraz comes to Cruckston New Jersey becomes Mickey's coach. Mickey gets better on pool each day. One day Joesph Alveraz brings his enormous truck and goes to a trip. While Joesph Alveraz is having a lovely trip, Mickey doesn't listen to Joesph Alveraz and plays Buck. Buck made Mickey break his arm. His best friend Arlen was down in the mouth. Is Mickey going to win the red shirt? I know but don't think you know. My reason for recommending this book is because it was a interesting book that kept me reading and reading from one chapter to the next 
 If you like books closer to real life, where the line between villian and victim is grey, you will probably find this a very good book.   I thoroughly enjoyed this book for the main reason many didn't, you had to look to your own moral compass to distinguish sinner and saint and not rely on the author to all but spell it out for you.  Which I believe gets us just a little more acquainted with who we are.   John Grisham, as his manner is, takes the reader on another crash course of law, in this book, tort litigation.  John Grisham is adept at weaving this education into his books without you realizing it until you get into a conversation with someone and the things you read roll of your tongue as if you are an expert yourself.   The story line was excellent, interesting and insightful.  However, the romance is a bit vague and disconneted (to me this has never been one of Grisham's strong suits anyway).  Overall, I found it to be a book hard to put down 
 I am always amazed by books written by women in a time period when they were seen as reserved and protected and uninformed, yet the novels reveal anything but that. It is clear why she won the pulitzer prize for this novel - and the first woman to do so at that!  It was amazing that the main character - Archer Newland - is at once admirable and a snake at the same time. Ultimately my opinion of him was that of a coward. But the fact that Edith Wharton was able to relate that to her readers as a woman writing in the male character - is incredible. Two thumbs up 
 I found this book to contain simple but profound truths. It is an easy read. I am not knowlegable of Buddhist practice and found it interesting and fairly informative on that topic. His views of Jesus were often refreshing and new. On a negative note, the topic of mindfulness seemed to be the solution to all issues and problems. Who knows - maybe it is 
 This is the only diet book I have read that really shows results! No, this is not one of those books with just one diet to follow. This book pulls together secrets from models, superstars, people who have had succesful diets, and more. Inside this book, you will find neat secrets that will help you lose weight without going through all that trouble! I also enjoyed learning how models, singers, and actresses stay so thin. For example, did you know that many models carry kelp tablets to speed up metabolism? Or, that Jamie Lee Curtis onece cut all fat from her diet and ate nothing but vegetables to get a role in a movie?! Not only that, but this book also includes many success stories of people who have been on diets and came out happy and appreciative of their bodies. You will also find free sources (mostly websites) which provide advice and tips for dieters. I also enjoyed the chapter with tons of delicious recipies all under 200 calories. Whether your goal is to lose 35 pounds in two months, or you just need to lose 5 pounds for a party next week, this book is a wonderful reference and very helpful 
 If you've never read Rendell, this is as good a place to start as any.  No writer I know of can surpass Ruth Rendell in consistently pulling the rug out from under the reader.  And this one -- as usual -- has a surprise on  the very last page, just when you think everything has been settled 
 A well written book which explores Hollywood genres with easy to read examples of classic Hollywood movies, and their effect on the movie-going public of the day. Comprehensive and absorbing 
 #2 of Sepultura's big four albums of their career (Beneath The Remains, Arise, Chaos AD, and Roots). it contains killer tracks like Desperate Cry, Arise, and Dead Embryonic Cells. an awesome thrash metal album and probably one of the best the came out in the early 90's. after this one, they would continue to evolve with the massive Chaos AD album a few years later.. 
 I love Dennis Quaid and I love the New Orleans scene.  The Big Easy is a timeless movie.  I have watched it many times when I need a dose of romance and action 
 I got this book for my 3 year old and I think it is great!  It gives a lot of really good information that is on his level and I think it will really help a lot after I have the baby and bring her home. It is really helpful in preparing him for the changes that are about to happen and get us all talking about what we can expect.  I am really glad that I ordered this book! 
 Johnson is one of our greatest and most underappreciated living authors (yes, underappreciated, even though he has been lavishly praised by critics). He isn't just capable of writing a good book or two, he's a classic talent, and it's obvious from his very first novel. Angels reads like an epic poem - every sentence is carefully weighed and effective, and a sense of character emerges even out of shattered impressions. The flawed characters are still somehow endearing, and the sense of dark and cryptic religion, from occultism to by-the-book Christianity, underpinned by Bob Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone,' is powerful. This book should be read and enjoyed; eventually, also, reprinted and remembered 
 Aside from its unmemorable title, this 282-page first novel by Laura Whitcomb is a true delight. Gifted with poetic vision and imagination, Whitcomb fashions a world for openminded readers where anything is possible, including the immortality of the soul. The spirit of Helen enters "dead bodies" - who have exited the material world via natural death, coma, drug overdose, parental disapproval - and inhabits these bodies, which, while telling a marvelous story, enables  the reader to experience life anew: the delicious taste of an apple, or a game of Scrabble: "7 squares perching...on the little wooden pew of my Scrabble rack."  The book challenges the reader to examine issues of importance in our day: use of illegal drugs; sex without love; infidelity; betrayal; true love; discovering oneself and finding God.  Although a bit wordy, the book was an attention-keeper from the beginning ("Someone was looking at me, a disturbing sensation if you're dead") to the equally surprising and satisfying conclusion. 
 This was an amazing book. It touched my heart so deeply and i would recommend it to everyone. 
 i bought this book on a whim and i began so enwrapped that household chores didn't exist for 2 days. being 62 yrs young and comic book collector for years[uncle scrooge] this was a rare treat for me. the price was right for the amount of volume at the book store. if you ever are bored and need some laughs, suspence, oh my's, please read this book. the nasties are real nasty and grandma can out run a cow in a race. tenderness and heroes abound in this book. a word of caution for young reader's- there are a few graphic pictures but compare to what is in junk comic books at the grocery store these are tame. so if you have a comic book kid in the family this will be well received and they disappear for hours. this book contains 13 years of bone and 9 books. i paid 35.95 for a fabulous book. 
 The book was everything I expected. The story was great and the characters developed the whole way to the end. Action, suspence and a happy ending. Not all King books have a happy ending but I'm glad this one did. 
 Garfield's Empty Words is an insightful and helful commentary to the Mulamadhyamakakarika, which he has also has a translation of in print. I was particularly impressed with his skillful application of Nagarjuna's theory of causation concerning the cultivation of the bodhicitta and the requisite belief in the rebirth as established in the Geluk School.  His rejection of such a notion is explicated in clear terms that shows how their tradition runs contrary to the philosophy of Madhymaka 
 The "The Knowledge Management Toolkit" is the best book I've  read so far on this topic. Without being a cookbook, it gives all practical  knowledge and touches all the different aspects involved when setting up a  KM-project. It goes well beyond the theoretical concepts where most other  books on KM stop.  One of the chapters I find most interesting is "Aligning  knowledge management and business strategy". It provides a good model to  scope your KM-project. The practical cases spread all over make the topics  very understandable. After reading Tiwana's book, you should be able to  start working on a KM-project and finalize it successfully 
 Sharon McCone is back in the 23rd series novel by Marcia Muller. McCone's detective agency has grown and life looks good, until good fortune takes a dive.   Julia Rafael, one of the more interesting characters Muller has introduced in this series, takes center stage as she is arrested for credit-card fraud. Rafael is near the completion of her investigator apprenticeship under McCone's leadership, and a former client from a case Rafael worked accuses her of stealing his credit card.   The client in question is Alex Aguilar, an up and coming political figure in the San Francisco area, who became popular for his goodwill project to provide job training to the out-of-work.   Rafael's less than above-board past and smart-aleck mouth and attitude leave her friends and employer wondering, did she do it? And when some packages bearing Rafael's name are delivered to the mailroom beneath the detective agency, McCone is forced to consider the possibility that they've all been conned.   In one crashing moment, McCone's agency is in danger of being fined and ultimately closed down. Who better to investigate the case than McCone herself, who has the most at stake?   She could use her long-time lover, Hy Ripinsky's help and support, but by calling him, she must answer his marriage proposal. But she doesn't know what her answer will be and prefers not to explore her resistance too deeply.   A visit to Aguilar's neighbors reveals that the man has a very different faade than the one publicly seen. He's a rather angry, rude, obnoxious man and he recently had a known felon as a house guest.   But all leads lead to nowhere and the stakes continue to rise as bodies start dropping and McCone's nephew is shot at; then Julia Rafael is critically wounded.   Cryptic messages are targeted at McCone and they hold the key to the shooter. But will they clear Julia's name?   Continuing a series runs the risk of repeated storylines, but Muller has not succumbed to this common pitfall. Kudos to Muller for escaping that trap. 
 Triple Play Products are a joke of a company. They have no customer support, for example I needed to get a handle for my sit n stroll, it took 3 weeks of me calling nonstop for them to get aggravated enough to send me one. They also left a voice mail saying I was swearing and harassing them. First I never swear when talking to any kind of customer service even if it is a voice mail every time you call for three weeks straight. Second if by harassment they mean the first ten days that I called I was nice and the last 11 days I called I told them that their customer service is nonexistent and a joke and that the company had no business ethics what so ever, then guilty as charged. I also got in touch with Strolex the actual maker of the sit n stroll and tried to get parts thru them they gave me the Triple Play Products phone number. When I explained my problem with Triple Play to Strolex they didn't seem to be shocked, and even said other people have had the same problem with them. The product is great you can get one at [...]with the mesh bag and the sun cover and shipping. Great product I just hope you never have to replace parts, and if you do need to get parts plan on waiting 3 weeks for a response, and to be called a harassing customer because Triple Play Products has no clue what business ethics are 
 Finally!  We were so disappointed when the first video came out and they only had a few of the episodes on the tapes.  Now the DVD's are out and we can marathon all the episodes every night for a week.  Watching the Goods is how we got started veg gardening so many years ago... and were still at it!  As Tom would say, "Ahhh." Don't think we could get away with the goats and chickens here in Claremont though...too many Margos.  
 I purchased this item about a month ago because I wanted a 720p upconvert 6-disc changer.  This dvd player looks great and comes with a good remote for a dvd player.  It is easy to maneuver through the menus as well.  In terms of picture, there is not any noise or strange artifacts.  Overall it looks great on my Pioneer plasma.  The changer is a tad slow to load, but convienetly resumes play at the same location even if you've had the player off for a day or two.  I do not however, have anything to compare this  player to.  I may look into the Denon 1930ci just to get an idea of how it performs by comparison 
 The title says it all. The movie had interesting and funny parts. However, the outcome was somewhat predictable. Lots of parts are funny because they relate to things adults can understand. Other parts would be funny to kids. Overall, it is not a bad movie to rent, but not something to be bought and watched over and over again (at least by 30 something year olds) 
 I stumbled onto this journal at a book store and knew that I had to have it. It comes with plenty of room to write down your private thoughts and also includes some very nice quotes. I love it 
 Before you read this book read the first book in the series "The Cellar", you won't be asking the question "who is this character?" when you read "The Beast House." "The Midnight Tour" is the third book in this Trilogy (paid through the nose for this one but it was worth it if you can find it). I am telling you I am more than impressed with these books, they are well written and fun to read. I did find this book kind of Kinky at times but what the heck! Highly recommend Laymons books, they are one of a kind in the horror arena! 
 I have to state that I am the Fiachra mentioned in the front inset of the book.  i learnt more about my family reading this book than i ever imagined possible.  For those who are interested to know Mr. Sheridans 2nd book in  just finished and will emotionally move any man or woman as hard as a rock  to tears.  Like the previous reviewer i had never cried until i read this  book.  The next book deals with a more adult view on the trials and  tribulations of life and the complex issues of love.  If you haven't  already read 44, do so b4 no.2 hits the shelves 
 "Holy caRRRnations, Mary. Take a look at this!", you might exclaim for seeing this book the first time. "Look at the clever propaganda of Scotts trying to sell us more of their products!" Well, you might think that . . . but you're wrong. You and I have the advantage -- yeap, GREAT advantage -- of living in the Information Age. And in the process of trying "to sell us more of their Scotts products" -- for those of you for who the glass is half-empty -- Messrs. Nick Christians and Ashton Ritchie have provided us not only with probably the best book on lawns, but invaluable information on lawn care from A to Z.  The chapters of "Scotts Lawns: Your Guide to a Beautiful Yard" are: (1) "Your Dream Lawn" (an introduction), (2) "Fertilizing", (3) "Watering", (4) "Mowing", (5) "Managing Thatch", (6) "Troubleshooting" (this just might be the best chapter which describes methods of how to cure a lawn from pests, diseases and weeds), (7) "Reviving your Lawn", (8) "Brand New Lawn", and "Resources & Index." Beautifully laid out and photographed, written in a user-friendly style, and interspersed with excellent tips and advice, Messrs. Christians and Ritchie have produced an accessible yet comprehensive guide for the novice or the professional. I have recommended this book to many friends who have returned to me after having bought it and said, "This IS the best book on lawns! It has EVERYTHING." It really does. And although I, personally, cannot say that this is the best book on lawns for simply not having read any other book on this matter (I feel that I don't need to), I would put it to you this way: you will be hard-pressed to find a better book on lawn care than this one! By following the steps outlined in this book, you will obtain a lawn . . . that even Louis XIV would be proud of. 
 I won't talk about the plot because other reviewers already did, I  want to point out that I just love the interactions between the protagonists, if you like your heroine very smart and at the same time very endearing, none of that dumb stubbornness sometimes we found in other authors but a pretty female character, independent (like all other Heyer females!) and very interesting overall.  You will have a marvelous time reading this story, it is very good, go ahead and read it 
 The number of bloggers and readers continues to climb. Bloggers don't censor themselves; they feel free to say anything about anyone. Yet big-name companies such as Boeing, GM and IBM have begun to include blogs in their communication strategies. They understand that they can take advantage of blogs' power and influence. In an easy-to-read, conversational style, much like the blogs themselves, Shel Holtz and Ted Demopoulos explain how you can use blogs, both internally and externally. They also dig into why and how you should monitor blogs - even if you decide not to start your own. We recommend this introduction to communication directors and others who wish to understand blogging from a business perspective. If your business has already joined the blogosphere, you'll benefit from the book's discussion of tracking and monitoring 
 All the Pretty Horses reveals the fate of a young man trying to live his life by a code no longer recognized by the world.  His personal integrity is based on his ability to follow through with his commitments to himself and others and to honor the values his western lifestyle forged by his West Texas upbringing.  His lack of close relationships with females taints his view of love and when his survival depends on his willingness to kill, he struggles with the morality of living a life based on survival of the fittest.  His journey toward manhood and choosing his own destiny is fraught with loneliness, moral dilemnas, and cruel lessons about human nature and survival.  The best and worst of human nature is exposed in this bildungsromain by McCarthy.  His style is difficult to follow but the beautiful prose more than makes up for his lack of speaker tags, punctuation, and quotation marks.  This book is a treasure worth seeking out and discovering 
 As an adult, I picked this book up for my daughter and began looking over it in the car.  Before I knew it I had read the whole thing and wanted to read the first book in the series.  My daughter and I both really liked it, sci-fi, adventure, and a little romance thrown in just for fun 
 If you're a Westerner, you won't after you read this book.  This book has destroyed with total thoroughness any pretention that being "normal" and adjusted has anything to do with health or  fulfillment.  A devastating social critique 
 For this Dolphy fan, Last Date stands the test of time as one of his finest performances.  Recommended to any jazzcat into 60's avant.  Dolphy explodes on bass clarinet on his version of Monk's classic, Epistrophy.  Dolphy, Epistrophy...hmmm? The drum and bass work is nothing special but the Scandanavian team does the job.  The piano player (also Scandanavian) is a nice surprise with interesting melodic and rhythmic chord placements.  All in all, one of Dolphy's best and one to go back to time and time again for new insights.  There's even a quote from Eric after the final track.  A must buy for anyone who says they're seriously into jazz 
 Disney travels to the Grecian island of Crete to film this enjoyable tale of a young English girl, played by teen favorite Hayley Mills and her Aunt (Joan Greenwood), who are traveling the area in search of native folk songs.  While visiting Crete, Hayley meets young and handsome Peter McEnery, and is soon swept up into mystery, romance, and intrigue.  The film has a Hitchcock feel to it, and reminds the viewer a little of "To Catch A Thief" and "The Man Who Knew Too Much."  I believe it's the locales and the fine performance of Eli Wallach, as the jewel thief Strattos.  I highly recommend "The Moon-Spinners," it has a vacation feel and is quite enjoyable to watch, especially for Hayley Mills fans.  The dvd is featured in the full screen format, however, the picture's transfer is very clean and the audio sounds good.  I too, would prefer the films in their original wide screen formats, but just to have these Disney classic films available to add to my dvd library, whether full screen or wide screen, is something to be thankful for.  
 This Modern Library edition runs true to form, lacking much in the way of supplemental material or notes but providing a good basic presentation of the text on quality paper in a good binding.  An edition to keep on the shelf for occasional reading rather than a student's book.  If there's a really good scholarly edition of the "Morte" out there I don't know about it - anyone?  
 In 1966, Bill Hullett was a seventeen year old California kid playing in Top 40 copy bands at high school dances in the San Jose area. Even then, it was obvious that Hullett was destined to be the kind of musician who would have complete mastery of his instrument, but never flaunt technique for effect. His talent and refined musical sensibilities stood out very early, and a few years later, were a perfect match for the studios of Nashville.  He's made a career playing around Music Row and has enhanced the recorded works of many pop and country luminaries. Two Lane Blacktop, Hulletts first solo recording effort, amply demonstrates what great studio musicians bring to every session. Each cut on this instrumental album features guitar perfection...great tone & memorable riffs played without ego-tripping excess. Extra treats include some fine solos from guest Sonny Landreth and a selection of vintage instruments from Hullett's collection, including a-blast-from-the-sixties past, an electric Sitar!   A great recording for all guitar fans 
 The man who gave us "The Great Game" now takes us 20 or so years forward, to the era after the Russian Revolution when Lenin send his followers into Asia to spread his word.  It is a dramatic, sometimes  tragic, sometimes comic narrative, full of extraordinary people, most  memorable of which may be Colonel Reginald Bailey, a very British spy whose  disguise as a fanatical revolutionary was so successful that he was once  ordered by his Communist masters to arrest himself!  Anybody with an  interest in history, in travel, in adventure or just in good storytelling  should try to seek out Hopkirk's splendid books 
 Flipping through Ms. Boettger's vitae my first impression is that she has been selling art history door to door, I began humming Willy Nelson's On the Road Again, as I scanned her long typed hodgepodge of one-night stands in whatever backwater bog had a check to write.   Like the circuit pastors before her wherever the stagecoach stopped she hopped out and preached the gospel of contemporary art. A night course here, a lecture there, an awkward critique, the odd fifty-buck panel.  I suspect all of that is behind her now: in this stunning debut it cannot be overstated that Ms. Boettger has produced a major historical document, one on which a McEvilley or a Krauss would be proud to place their stamp.   It is meticulously researched-the sixty-nine page bibliography and notes alone are thick enough to bludgeon a thesis advisor-given that most art writing sings the rhythm of a rental lease I dreaded the 316 pages in front of me. But this writing does not drone like an academic sermon rather it engages with the timbre of a joyful story teller, I found myself in ClancyLand grabbing handfuls of pages in each sitting and looking forward to her next tale.  Still her immense research underlies the imaginal prose and Ms. Boettger writes with a staggering authority, if I had not known better I would have assumed that this was her tenth book and not her first. I cannot imagine another art historian brave enough to dare a modification for at least a generation 
 Long enough to wash your back, will wad up something like a pouf, but the texture is perfect! You will wonder why you've ever used a cloth to wash your body (not ideal for the face with sensitive skin).  Makes super lather from your bar or liquid soap.  Rinses clean after every use. It will spoil you! Lasts for years with daily use 
 Best gift I have ever received!  It is teeming with great ideas!  For a hopelessly square, artistically challenged, straight arrow like me, this book is a godsend.   Now, I can act out my fantasy of living the bohemian life, and I don't have to bother with smoking unfiltered cigarettes, wearing a black beret, growing a goatee, moving to Williamsburg (Brooklyn), and snapping my fingers at free-form poetry readings.  I just have to do a few of these easy art projects, leave the results lying around my house, and voila!   Instant Hip.  And, of course, the best part of it all is that I don't have to spend a lot of money on art school in the process.   My favorite ideas were the "bread-n-jam mini layer cakes" and the "brocolli stem pickles" - I have learned that the way to my inner "starving" artist is through my stomach 
 The 'Inquistion' was one of the great disasters of Jewish history, involving the slaughter and torture of tens of thousands of innocent people. In this work of historical narrative and analysis the origins of the racist anti- Semitism that characterize the behavior of late fifteenth century Spain the beginning of the process is traced to the Egypt of  525 A.D. The long story of  Spanish Jewry is told here including that of the Conversos who left Judaism for Christianity, and who were nonetheless persecuted by the Inquistion. The fact that these people were Christian and still persecuted is the strong indication that the persecution was done on a racial basis.  The disastrous destruction of one of the great Jewish communities of history is shown to be the result of a warped ideology , an evil and cruel racism. 
 'The Assistant' might be a bit dated in depicting the struggling Jewish shopkeeper as universal sufferer, since time and place and circumstance change social and ethical foundations and hierachies.  Some people might see the book as too allegorical/parabolic and symbolic as well. But is that a fault of the book or of the benign neglect of many thoughtful people toward suffering and raw expression?  The characters make it above the level of stereotype, albeit not by much, and the New York of the early 1950's is not the one of today (even the Brooklyn of the 50's isn't).  Nevertheless, in creating a modern parable of suffering and redemption within a circumscribed world of a few blocks of a Brooklyn neighborhood inhabited by the local Jews, Italians, and Irish, Malamud has created a book that is accessible to anyone with a heart and interesting enough for anyone with a literary bent.  It can also give pause (to anyone who is wanting to give pause) to those caught up in the hypermaterialist world today.  John Lennon said "life if what happens what you're doing other things."  This book can help bring you down to earth in between reading brochures on M.B.A. programs. 
 Arvo Part exhibits absolute mastery of sacred vocal writing. It is the culmination of a millenium of sacred music; as though Tallis, Byrd, Bach, Mozart, Brahms, Faure and every other writer of sacred music had simply cleared the way for this man. Part assimilates you into his music in the opening passages and holds you in his powerful grip until after the last phrases have been uttered.  The glory is not given only to the voices, either. These works are also scored for strings and some of the most beautiful passages are given over to them. Dissonance is used throughout in all voices with terrifying beauty and brings to mind what it may be like to behold the presence of God Himself. There are many stunning climaxes that resolve the discord throughout the work - everyone infinitely satisfying and never dull. These are truly works of awe-inspiring proportions, particulary the Te Deum and this does them justice. It will lift your mind and heart and never cease to amaze 
 To this day, Scrubs is still one of those shows that is not totally appreciated by the network that airs it, doesn't get huge ratings, but still has a fantastic fan base that truly cares about the show.  In the second season, viewers got to know a lot about the personal lives of the characters, which helped to make them more real and eventually inspired people to really invest in them, which is what makes the fan base so devoted.  Scubs is not like any other sitcom, at least any that I watch. It's odd fantasy sequences are quite unique and the no-studio audience format is quite interesting. There is no laugh track, which leaves you laughing on your own.  And, watching Season two, there were plenty of chances to laugh.  As J.D. (Zach Braff), Elliot (Sarah Chalke) and Turk (Donald Faison) enter their second year at Sacred Heart Hospital, they are certainly bound to take a step up. Instead of being interns, they are now residents, left with more decisions and more responsibility.  John (J.D.) Dorian is the center of the show and the episodes, for the most part, are written from his point of view. He provides the narration for almost all the episodes and the fantasies are usually spawned from his brain. In season two, he wrestles with his feelings for fellow resident Elliot Reed, battles with chief resident Perry Cox (John C. McGinley), sees his best friend Turk get engaged and has numerous romantic entanglements. I will say, that JD gets tons of beautiful women. In this season alone, guest stars that went on dates with him include Amy Smart as the Tasty Coma Wife (A great episode) and Sarah Lancaster as the gift shop girl. But truly, JD is lonely, especially in comparison to his best friend Turk. One highlight of the season is a visit from J.D.'s brother (Tom Cavanaugh). The pair actually look a  lot alike.  Turk, in season one, met nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes) and in season two, the pair become engaged. It is revealed in commentaries by the show's creator, that Turk and Carla are a couple they plan on keeping together for the length of the show and they have to work out many problems to get to that point. In season two, Turk's engagement ring gets swallowed by a young patient, Carla's mother dies, Turk's brother (guest star D.L.  Hughley) creates havoc on their relationship and they have the typical arguments that come with being newly engaged.  Elliot has problems of her own, ranging from battling her feelings for JD to exploring other relationships, mainly with nurse Paul (guest star Rick Schroder). She finds herself cut off from her father's money, forced to live in a truck for a while and then crashes on Turk and JD's couch. She is a nervous wreck for the most part, but at the same time she is a competent doctor, who just needs to get her personal life in check.  As Dr. Cox, McGinley is superb.  His long rants and diatribes are hilarious to listen to and the way he chooses a different girls' name to call JD every time he speaks, is pretty funny as well. In this season, he reunites with his ex-wife Jordan (Christa Miller), who is pregnant and eventually delivers, his baby. A highlight of the season was the episode where Cox narrates, taking over from JD's usual role. It is insightful to hear from someone else every now and then. He also has a relationship with a pharmaceutical rep, played to perfection by Heather Locklear.  Ken Jenkins adds a bit of meanness as Chief of Staff Bob Kelso. He constantly berates Dr. Cox and is always looking for a resident or intern to pick on, often settling on Elliot or JD. His pompous attitude creates a lot of friction between himself and other members of the staff, but that leads to a lot of great comedic moments.  Neil Flynn is added to the regular cast as the nameless janitor. According to commentaries with the show's creator, Flynn ad libs most of his lines. His incessant picking on JD is quite funny and really, I find the janitor to be the funniest character on the show. I love it when he pretends to be a doctor, or just finds inane ways to pick on JD.  As far as extras go, this set is great. There are a number of commentary tracks with creator Bill Lawrence and various cast members. There are a number of featurrettes, one dealing with guest stars, another with music. There are deleted scenes and outtakes and a one-on-one interview with John C. McGinley, which is quite interesting. I found the commentaries to be quite informative and a very welcome addition to the set.  All in all, a great set of a show that has yet to be truly appreciated by the networks and even by some television fans. This is quality comedic television 
 I read Huckleberry Finn just this year! Of course I heard about the book and references to it all my life. I guess I had to take the plunge. And what a joyful ride it was! I liked these two chaps- one white and free another black and slave- on the run so alone under the sun and stars. At the same time they are chasing their own wild dreams and adventures.  Humour is spread all over the book and it often takes quirky turns. I can laugh at some very small bits from the beginning of the novel where Tom Sawyer makes an unsuccessful attempt to form a gang of robbers, towards the end of book where impish Tom kisses his own aunt on the lips under disguise of some other boy and Jim being supplied with all sorts of insects and snakes while in captivity.  But what makes this story great is the noble theme that runs throughout the book. Society's inhuman and exploitative nature and human heart's own capacity for love, compassion and friendship, above all. As we see in the book human compassion and friendship triumphs over greed, malevolence and injustice of an unjust and small hearted society 
 I read an old "ACE" copy of this that I found in a thrift shop.  This is not only based on linguistic science, the writing showcases the wide range and fluency of Vance's own lexicon and diction.  In addition,  the plot is strong, the characters well thought out, and the pace is  rapid--typical of the older science fiction adventures 
 One of my favorite CD's...to sprinkle all over my home as well as gifting it to friends.  Raviji is truly Divine and George's participation, as well as George himself, is a gift from the Gods 
 Would that all writers of mystery used words as well as PD James does in The Lighthouse. James is, for one thing, notable for her skill at keeping her characters fresh and her plots stimulating. In this book, a mysterious death occurs on a secluded, isolated island that is used as a getaway by the rich and powerful. James richly describes the island and the people, and with her words is able to show you so much more about her characters and their motivations than she actually tells. Many years ago, James introduced the concept of literature as mystery, and she can still be counted on to deliver a satisfying novel 
 This is the book that got me totally addicted to all of Brockmann's SEAL team 16 books. If you have not discovered them yet you may want to consider hiring a housekeeper, babysitter, taking leave from your job etc. before reading them because you won't be able to do anything but turn pages for awhile! They are that good. Brockmann's books are in a class by themselves. The only problem is she can't write them fast enough for me! I fell in love with the character of Senior Chief Stan Wolchonok in this story 
 Loved the movie and now I have the soundtrack to remember the parts of the movie I liked best-like when the "italian ladies sing". 
 I've been on a "diet" for a long time now on and off. When I first saw this book out I was skeptical thinking it was just your ordinary diet book or what to eat and exercise. YOU ON A DIET is far from that. I bought it just yesterday night and couldn't put the book down. I finished it this morning and can say that I'm confident in myself and looking forward to start my week off with a healthier outlook on life. It's  not your weight that is important but your waist! By reading this book you'll understand how your food goes down through the breaking down process and how you feel from it. I understand a lot better now that I know what and which chemicial is responsible for eating another slice of cake. I HIGHLY recommend this book. It is entertaining and clear. The information and knowledge about food gives me a heads up on what I have to look for in order to run my body right. Life is hard enough as it is. Lets not make food top of our priority list.   The book promises to NEVER DIET AGAIN. Sooner or later you'll be used to the lifestyle and know automatically when to stop and what to eat in the first place. I know I just finished it this morning but I'm going to start today till the next two weeks and see how far I get. 
 Purchased as a gift for a long time fan of this movie 
 I LOVE THIS CD!!!  Especially the song "Dear Mr. President"!!!  By far the BEST song P!NK has EVER written!! 
 This was my first exercise ball tape I bought.  Being a larger size person, I found that this was a help to getting started.  I can do most of the exercises right away.  I like that it has exercises with weights also.  I find this a help to getting back into shape, even with my bad back.  
 In one of her sketches, Sarah talks about how she used to be a betwetter and after seeing this I'm sure she's out to make half her audience pee their pants too. I'm still in the dry half but just barely. I would recommend this to anyone who thinks they're hearing too many cliches and wants the envelope pushed instead of pulled. Be advised though, Sarah can be very direct at times 
 I gave this book to my grandmother.  It has tips on dealing with nasea, how to prepare food so it doesn't taste metalic, etc... Lots of real and useful information for getting proper nutrition.  My grandmother wasn't in the right frame of mind to accept the information.  Good food will greatly contribute to our health and well being, I'm sad she could not allow herself this.  It is a great book without being to new agey- after all it's by America's kitchen sweetheart, Betty Crocker.  How more traditional can you get?  Best of health to you and yours 
 Very capable and sophisticated shooter for the price...a little  lacking in optical zoom. Easy to use, takes detailed pics and can copy documents 
 This two-part essay is a look at the nuts and bolts of being a writer.  The first part examines the nature of the writer's mind and why writers always seem to be trying to outrun failures nobody else can see.  The second is a list of applied tactics to produce work on a tight deadline.  Part one, "Why Writers Are Cranky," starts from the presumption that writers, as a class of people, are dissatisfied with the whole world, themselves included, and are trying to do something right.  Why else, the author suggests, would we expend so much effort trying to make up for past shortcomings?  We are our own worst critics, always trying to do better than last time, always trying to leave the world a little better than we found it.  Professor Rogers' insights into the source of this spur are by no means definitive, but they are strong and incisive.  Part two, "Five Emergency Tools," is a selection of tactics Professor Rogers has personally used to get short stories out under the deadline.  I've only used two myself so far, but if they are representative, I can tell you two things.  First, they work.  Second, they only work for short stories or scenes; if you are looking to write a novel, you'll need to go with a different set of tools, or else use these to build your book scene by scene.  Combining both the insightful and the handy, this article is one that will speak to writers right where they live.  Keep it close at hand, because you'll read and use it more than once.  And what greater compliment can you give a writer than that his article will be read and used 
 Howard Blum has written a compelling true narrative of a small group of Jewish soldiers who fought the Nazis along side the British Army in WWII. This little known slice of history is conveyed persuasively in The Brigade.   Blum discovered this small piece of history by accident when visiting the US Holocaust Museum. After he pulled together scores of interviews, he chose to tell the story through the eyes of three soldiers and one survivor, the sister of one of the soldiers. This telling is what gives this book its potency.   The strength of The Brigade is that it reads as a novel, and the reader cannot turn the pages fast enough to find out what happens next. Blum's accurate portrayal and attention to details is what keeps us focused on the reality of this amazing story of courage and perserverance. He reminds us through his excellent storytelling that this did happen.  The book is not another war novel that expounds on the accounts of military victories. It shows the sacrifices and the souls of these men who risked their lives to save their people. It reveals their struggles and their doubts as well as their triumphant spirits.  The Brigade is a must read. It is uplifting and demonstrates the human spirit at its best.  
 Nora Roberts' blended talents branch into writing romance, mystery, action scenes, etc. and they are all present in this great read. I also loved the feisty 'twin' character who shows how opposite sisters can be as far as personality. There's also a strong portrayal of women as survivors and not just victims. The tension is high, and though I had some ideas, I did not figure out who the killer was until the very end. Chrissy K. McVay author of 'Souls of the North Wind 
 This book is amazing, truly one of Dostoyevsky's greatest works. Dostoyevsky has an amazing talent for creating characters. Great authors can be recognized by their ability to create characters that the reader can identify with. However Dostoyevsky is not a great author, great is to meek a word; he creates characters that the reader identifies with so completely that, as a reader you 'Become' his character! This is a must read for any reader! Crime and Punishment follows the endeavers of Raskolnikov as he attempts to transcend humanity. We are taken along a psychological journey of life itself, that begins first and foremost with death 
 Watching this film of how El Salvador was torn apart from 1980-1992 is something not only Salvadoreans remember, but many people from different countries.  Showing that in this particular Civil War there was really no good or bad side.  A conflict of misunderstanding.  For my parents and many Salvadoreans that migrated here to the United States, definitely the true meaning of trying to find a better life 
 The package was here in a timely manner and in perfect condition 
 I like this tea, its a bit stronger than some grocery store teas but hard to find in store 
 Great product at a great price. The first shipment came broken and amazon replaced it immediately without the hassles of having to return a broken item.  Thank you 
 This is the first review I have written on anything, ever.  But, as an artist, I am telling you that this is the best sketchbook you will ever find...I carry it around with me everywhere...the more distressed it gets, the better it looks. I also love the way it closes (it folds over with a slightly magnetic clasp that is not visible).  That attention to detail is wonderful 
 THE VAN GOGH CAFE is a selection of stories about a "magical" cafe in a particular town in Kansas. The cafe is run by a man named Marc and his daughter. The cafe used to be an old moviehouse/vaudeville theatre and some of the performing magic is still around. Strange and uplifting events happen at the cafe. Some would call them bizarre, some just mere coincidence, others perhaps Providence. The book pretty much lets the reader decide. Whatever the case, one will go away feeling kind of warm and fuzzy and uplifted about life.  I usually don't recommend books that are totally warm and fuzzy, but this is a book that I'll make an exception 
 You will not find a more comprehensive book in print on Architecture History.  It covers more regions and time periods than any other book I've  seen.  To get this amount of information on architecture history through  another source you would need to buy two or three other books.  This book  has 4 times the number of drawings, photographs, and graphics of any other  architecture history book.  It is also well written in a concise yet  understandable manner.  Not only is this book the best quality and most  complete book of its kind, it is also by far the least expensive 
 I have been an avid fan of Jayne Ann Krentz and this book is her best.  She has combined some excellent family values with romantic suspense.  The dialogue is fun and you will find yourself laughing alone.  I highly recommend it 
 I bought this textbook together with Ferri's Clinical advisor with great enthusiasm. Though this book has fewer contributors, it offers enormous amount of information on physical assessment. Other than the reference pages at the end of each chapter, you cannot spot a single page that does not have a drawing, a photograph, charts, tables, or tips.  You cannot resist but feel great appreciation to the hard work invested in this masterpiece.   In the era of Internet, when many folks opted to stay away from books, this book's style offers very competitive alternative to electronic media. The only drawback is its blurred black and white photos. Although the author attempted to compensate for such deficit by many informative drawings, yet better quality photos help contemporary readers to stay focused longer during reading.   Of course, the book is about physical assessment so it stops short of complete orthopedic textbook. Each joint is discussed in terms of its applied anatomy, history taking, examination, and ends by case studies, followed by extensive lists of references.  In addition to regional assessments of joints, chapters 14 and 15 discuss the assessment of gait and posture, chapter 16 of the amputee, chapter 17 of emergency sports, and chapter 18 of physical evaluation prior to participation in sport. The eighteen chapters extend over a 1000 large sized pages with two color printing, which make its reading a breathe.  
 I went to Crobar NYC one night on a whim with some friends.  I have heard of this guy before but thought nothing of it.  When he started his set, I was very pleasantly surprised.  This guy is un-F*n real!!!!! You have to experience this guy live.  In my travels all over the nation and europe, I can honestly say; he is one of thee best Djs I have ever experienced...and I WAS SOBER!!!  Everyone was dancing..EVEN SECURITY! I am not kidding.. he really is a genius.  I never say that. I am so happy to have experienced this guy,this CD is great but if you get a chance to see him live...go 
 I really like this case.  It seamlessly protects the iPod, but the functionality is fantastic 
 Adeline Yen Mah was born in a well-placed, moneyed Chinese family prominent in the elite of Shanghai and later on in booming Hong Kong. Her mother died shortly after her birth, and she was always blamed for her death. Her father then married Niang, a beautiful Eurasian who is evil (particularly to Adeline), but nonetheless a formidable force in the Yen household.   Under Niang's harsh regime, her step-children become "second-class" citizens in the house, living in separate quaters. Adeline, encouraged by Aunt Baba, focuses especially on her studies, and eventually attends medical school abroad. Her "A-studded" report cards become symbols of a better future. Aunt Baba suffers a great deal during the Cultural Revolution, and this is worsened by Niang's cruelty. Her endurance till death mirrors that of Adeline, and their union in the end illustrates this.  A word often used in this book towards the end is "rapprochement", usually appearing italicized. This suggests sentiments of constantly wanting to be accepted by her family. This never happens, in spite of all her success and efforts of uniting a broken family. Her siblings plot against her, and she inherits nothing from her father's vast empire. This is indeed a testament of the human ability to endure in dire conditions. 
 I love the book!   Well-written, easy to read, highly-organized; it should be required reading for anyone writing serious business documents!  Chapter 5 on Researching is especially insightful.  Stelzner's search tips are beneficial not only for writing white papers but for all research needs. 
 When I first purchased Vol. 1 of this series, I was hoping there would be more to come. Vol. 2 was great as is Vol. 3. I keep them in my car the whole holiday season & also play them while I am working all day. Just some great cool grooves & a pleasant twist on holiday favorites. Vol. 3 also has some new numbers as well which fit right into the groove. I figure a year or two for Vol. 4, but I'll be waiting for it 
 I was looking for inspiration for something to read and found this book. The breadth and diversity of the authors and writing styles that Ellington and Freimiller bring to the reader expands ones reading horizon but stays accessable with an array of high quality works. I recommend this book as it will lead to multiple literary discoveries 
 This woman obviously needed help and so did those kids. The second husband had no right leaving his son and the other child knowing what he knew was happening, if anything he or her parents should be the ones tried for that murder. With out giving too much of the story away, this was a very sad situation from her adolescence through adulthood and the fact that everyone turned away and ignore her is (I would like to say shocking but this being America where everyone turns their back on others) irresponsible. There were enough people who could have gotten involved and freed those children and the mother before letting that murder happen. As much as she moved around there were plenty of people knowing what was going on. It was so preventable. But unfortunately this is a country where from the teachers to the  Child Protective Services no one pushes it far enough even though few neighbors tried and ended up paying for it. 
 The principles in this book have been very helpful. What it says is true in my experiecne too - unless we work to change from the inside and recognize our true potential we will bnever reach that potential. What we think and imagine is what we create. A great, easy read in spite of some really deep principles. Joe has a great writing style.  I've followed Dr. Peale for yers and if you like his writings you'll like Joe's 
     This book is about a six a year old boy in the past.  His name is Ben McDonald.  It is the last day of school for Beth, John, and Coral.  Ben starts imitating a prairie chicken and wanderes away from home.  A storm is coming.  He runs for shelter but he falls in a badger hole.  He becomes friends with the badger.  Will he keep alive?  I recommend this book to all readers.                             
 By her own admission, Pederson is a reporter, and not a theologian. This books reads as an extended newspaper article. It is easy for the layman to comprehend, without complicated theological ideas or terms, as the author goes through her experiences and emotions in pursuit of the information. This is a journey of discovery, discovery both of Junia and who the author sees herself to be as a woman. I found it very easy to relate to her and was immersed in her travels and thoughts. I could clear picture places she's been to; those that I also have visited in Rome were accurately and imaginatively described.  Readers looking for novel theological insights should look elsewhere. This is a very personal look at Junia. There is a tendency in this book to be too accepting of hagiophora- where stories of powerful women are considered credible despite their lack of historical verifiability. Sometimes Pederson's lack of theological training shows in misunderstandings of subtle nuances, but most of the time she has done her homework. Thus her work becomes a compendium of others thoughts, and this becomes the go-to book for information on Junia.  While at times it felt that Pederson was trying to fill in the pages with extraneous information (like the chapter on Thecla), the book is so full of the stories of Junia that it becomes a necessary and central document for any research on this apostle. There really isn't much verifiable information out there on her, beyond the one verse in Romans. Of particular interest therefore is Pederson's extended look into the culture of ancient Rome and what it would have been like to be a married Christian Jewish woman in Junia's time.  Pederson has done an admirable job of looking into all the ramifications of this one verse. Using the primary research of others, Pederson proves without doubt that this was a woman, and that she was likely an apostle (and not just liked by the apostles). For the question of apostleship Pederson relies more on the consensus of modern theologians and ancient church fathers, rather than a clear indication in the Greek (for the Greek could provide either reading). Indeed, through Pederson's research into the gender-reversals of Junia through the centuries, a clear picture comes out of where the revisionist history comes from. The revision is clearly not in making her female, but in making her male- by the unanimous agreement of Christian theologians through the first 1000 years. Pederson traces how different translations will use different genders for Junia, based on how closely they adhere to the original Greek or not. She shows a copious provenance for the various translations to clearly illustrate why we have both male and female Junia's today.  Through the research the reader will finally realize that feminism is an original Christian idea- an idea of Christ and Paul- that is lost as the centuries go on and the msyogyny of the early Church Fathers sets in.  The modern world then battles that sexism of later Church elders, rather than the vision of the original Church.  After reading this book there really can't be any doubt as to Junia's gender. There have been perhaps some doubts because of the desire to remain traditional, and not to try to rewrite the Bible. Pederson has here shown that the rewrite is actually making a female apostle into a male 
 I found the book thought provoking.  I did some research using Mr. Carney's work and found his work very compelling 
 I just finished both The Present Darkness and Piercing the Darkness.  These were my first Peretti books and I truly enjoyed them.  I decided to pick this book up when things in my life were not going so well and everything around me seened to be falling apart.  What wonderful books.  Some of the scences in these books reminded me of times when I felt the fear of evil as these characters did.  Reading these reminded me of Gods love for me and no matter what he will always love me all I have to do is ask.  This book took me some time to read, about a month, but it was a great journey.  I would definitely recommend these books to Christians and non-Christians.  These books have a thrill and a suspense that all can enjoy 
 Such was the description of Eichmann given by his lawyer, Dr. Servatius. "Mailman" is quite apropos. What we have in Eichmann is the farthest thing from a dominant personality. He was a joiner and a conformist, but not a man who'd likely be evil outside the historical context of the Third Reich. Honestly, as Arendt's account makes clear, the fellow was a complete non-entity who only felt comfortable when speaking in his native tongue of officialese. As one of the Israeli interrogators pointed out, it is rather inconceivable that such a marginal talent could rise to the level of Lieutenant Colonel in the SS (but look at his peers).   A complete psychological study of the man is what Arendt's account achieves, and this is a book to read and read again. Eichmann in Jerusalem is valuable for its journalism, as it covers his trial aptly, but also for its history. As a narrator, Arendt is erudite and clever; although, sometimes she can border on the snide. There are a few things she makes note of which are not entirely accurate as well such as assuming that the July 20th conspirators only turned on Hitler when events went badly in the war. That's not the case. They leaked information to the allies before the war even started. Also, that the Nazis would back down when presented with determined civilian resistance to their anti-Jewish measures is highly dubious. Generally, they always met force with more force, and reprisals were their rule-backing down was the exception. Of course, the information available to Arendt back in 1961 cannot be compared to the tsunami of documentation we have at our fingertips today. Overall, this is a stunning work. 
 I totally enjoyed reading this book.  Although a lot of my friends consider me a "foodie", I really enjoyed reading the entries about the books and about what book clubs are doing across the country.  My wife belongs to a book club, and we have been fighting over who gets the book each night.  The recipes and the book summaries are great. I particularly enjoyed the mojitos and the honey cake, but so many of the recipes have been useful and intriguing.  Great book 
 This CD helped me to sleep during my entire pregnancy...I would rarely be awake by the end.  Very soothing, with just the right touch of very simple background music.  Nothing was abrupt or startling, everything flowed  perfectly 
 Gave this book as a gift and Nana loved it 
 I fully agree with the previous review in that Hersch sounds like Bill Evans. This being a plus, that's definitely not the only positive thing about this record. Apart from "Stuttering" there's plenty of other material that makes one wish to sit in and be part of that audience. Nasheet Waits and Drew Gress are great throughout the recording. Last but not the least, the recording quality and mastering stands as an example of what a club live set recording should sound like 
 The book is a huge help in planning meals for my husband.  It is valuable in helping us eat out and be creative in our menu planning. I would recommend it highly 
 Much has been made of the first great trio led by pianist Bill Evans, the one with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian.  Indeed, this trio revolutionized the piano trio format, using bass as an equal melodic and rhythmic contribution.  With LaFaro's death, though, the Evans trio backed off a bit from this approach, especially in the days with Chuck Israels in the bass chair.  When Eddie Gomez joined in the late 60s, however, the level of interplay between piano and bass was brought back, though to a lesser extent, and in Philly Joe Jones, Evans had a drummer who could be a third contributing voice.  This group unfortunately did not last, but Marty Morell, the drummer on the present album, was a very competent and complimentary drummer to Evans' and Gomez's interlocking lyricism.  In many ways, this album is more conservative than those albums from the groups where interplay was stressed.  But in the place of amazing interaction is absolutely brilliant work from the leader; it seems like Evans was at his most pianistic when the rest of the band took a back seat.  This album is like that, and though it wasn't the most groundbreaking (in fact if anything it was behind the times, recorded during the height of jazz-rock-fusion) it is one of the most beautiful.  Evans' choice of tunes for this live set at the Village Vanguard is a stunning mix of gorgeous standards and originals.  Most tunes feature rubato piano introductions that showcase how brilliant a pianist Evans was, and his presence is more commanding here than in anything he recorded before, including the classic Vanguard release with Scott LaFaro.  Then when the band comes in, we get to hear the three swing with the best of them.  Eddie Gomez is perhaps the most lyrical of all bass players; he has fluid technique and something about his tone and use of range pushes his soloing beyond the level of most bass solos.  My favorite tune here is definitely Joe Zawinul's "Midnight Mood."  Bill Evans' success as an artist lies in how he was always able to be creative and interesting while remaining totally accessible to anyone.  The music here will never be sonically offensive to anyone and is in fact quite beautiful on all levels.  His beautiful, dynamic pianism impressed even my Chopin crazed female friend who didn't even like Keith Jarrett's "The Koln Concert."  I am therefore convinced that even people fundamentally turned off by jazz will enjoy or at least be able to tolerate this music, and those who like jazz at any level will find this album stunningly beautiful.  Plus, if you enjoy this, there is also "The Tokyo Concert" by the same group during roughly the same period, which is equally as good, and the studio album from three years later, "I Will Say Goodbye" is close 
 In this day and age it is hard not to become obsessed with following the news but it is easy to forget that what you read in the newspaper is only half the story.  NPR reporter Anne Garrels tells the account of what goes on behind the news as she reports from Baghdad leading up to and during the war.  I was also happy to find that Garrels steers clear of the usual journalistic self aggrandizement in writing this incredible compelling book.  Weaving together her own daily life in Iraq, the pressures of dealing with the madness of Saddam's bureaucracy and her encounters with regular people, she opens up a whole different world to her readers.  This has the effect of humanizing the Iraquies, showing them as neither enemy nor victim as they are so often portrayed to suit the purposes of others but rather showing them as they are.  It is also refreshing to read how Garrels also breaks down the traditional barrier between the reporter and the public-showing how Garrels herself is like so many of us in being of two minds regarding the war and its consequences.  This thoughtful and powerful account of reporting from the front line should not be missed 
 Once formated this product is doing exactly what I needed - a back up for my computer.   Installation could not have been easier.  Instructions for doing a computer back up were confusing to me, but I'm not a rocket scientist when it comes to computers.   Re-formating the  "My Book" solved the problem and I am now very pleased with it and would definitely recommend it 
 I have this thing and personally I love it.  While its not a very pratical sword for actual fighting for a number of reasons, replicas like this aren't made for that anyway, but you just feel so powerful with it.  As far as weilding it, I found it's not as hard as everyone says.  I can weild it pretty well although I am a bigger guy.  Weight is not 29 lbs though...don't be alarmed it's more like 10 the length just makes it feel really heavy 
 Mr.Canada grew up in the 60's in the Bronx. In this book he talks about what it was like to live there. He talks about having to prove yourself or face the prospect of getting your ... kicked in the future. You get a VIVID description of what he was up against as a young person. I mean, I grew up  a long way away in a much less dangerous  place, and I knew exactly what he  was getting at. That's a testament to his writing, and the universality of  the subject. Mr. Canada recalls one episode where he is walking a few  blocks out of his neighborhood, and you get a detailed view of how  dangerous this was. Just walking down the street! All I can say against the  book is that I would have liked even more of the authors autobiography.  Later on in the book, he gets more polemical about what can be done. I  agree with what he says, but as far as literary quality goes, that stuff  isn't really in the same league as the earlier part of the book. Also, let  me say, the author has an excellent, direct writing style, which makes what  he has to say that much more powerful 
 My new year's resolution was to see a bunch of movies I'd always intended to see but continually seemed to miss.  Somewhat belatedly I'm fulfilling my resolution, which is why I finally saw WESTWORLD.  Although it was somewhat dated, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  The film concerns Delos, a resort of the future that allows guests to visit either of three theme parks where behavior that is frowned upon in the modern world can be engaged in without repercussion.  Guests engage in orgiastic sex, feasting and heavy drinking, and the killing of opponents just for the sheer fun of it.  One can choose between doing this in Roman World, Medieval World, or Westworld.  The film focuses primarily on two visitors to Westworld, played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin.  This was one of the last Sci-fi films made before the onset of the personal computer, yet one of the first to actually utilize computers in the making of it.  According to one book I recently read, the CGI representing the vision field of the The Gunslinger robot was the first use of computers to generate images in film history.  So, in this way it could be considered cutting edge.  On the other hand, when things start going wrong with a number of the robots, the head of technology on Delos describes the ailment as a "disease."  Today we'd obviously describe this as a virus in their software.    "Westworld" is clearly the stock Warner Brothers Western set that was used at approximately the same time by BLAZING SADDLES.  This works well for the film for it gives the viewer an image that seems weirdly familiar (though understandably familiar, since it has been used in dozens of movies and hundreds of television episodes).  So the visitors to the park get pretty much the Western experience prior media would have conditioned them to expect.  Even the bad guys seem familiar.  Yul Bryner, for instance, wears the exactly same outfit that he wore when he starred in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.  The visitors quickly fall into the routine, James Brolin doing an obvious imitation of Clint Eastwood and Richard Benjamin quickly breaking out of the mold of somewhat nerdy lawyer.  They visit the local brothel, kill the robot played by Yul Bryner a couple of times, get arrested and break out of jail and shoot the sheriff, and get drunk in the middle of a huge brawl.  Then things go wrong on a major scale, with the robots going on a killing spree.  The highpoint of the film is the long chase of Richard Benjamin by Yul Bryner.    A remake of WESTWORLD is currently in development.  I am normally opposed to remakes.  For the most part remakes are pale imitations of the originals, even in the case of most Sci-fi films.  The remakes of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS were inferior to the original, while the original PLANET OF THE APES is vastly superior to the remake.  But this is one instance where, if done correctly, a remake could improve upon the original.  The film is well done, but it was made well before computers came to dominate cultural life.  As a result, the computerized control room looks absurdly primitive.  For instance, there are no keyboards, but only consoles with buttons and switches and knobs.  The danger, of course, is going overboard with the special effects.  The temptation all too often is to go overboard with CGI and spectacular effects; in such cases story is sacrificed for spectacle.  My hope is that they will keep this under control and keep enhancements at a minimum.  All in all, this was a very enjoyable and different Sci-fi film.  It was directed and written by Michael Crichton and I couldn't help but think throughout it how similar the overall premise was to another Crichton creation:  JURASSAIC PARK.  Both deal with things going wrong at technologically advanced theme parks.  Substitute dinosaurs for robots or vice versa and you have essentially the same movie.  
 The ergonomics of the handset is good, the base is a nice, small footprint, and at 900 MHz. there's no interference with wireless routers.  Of course, the price ws great too 
 By this point, as the output of Fugazi's contemporaries either ceased or faded into mediocrity, Fugazi continued to reinvent itself with this album.  It pushes the boundaries of the pop aesthetic on Full Disclosure, while never losing its poingant voice on The Kill. At times haunted and disoriented, at others joyous (if only in sound), this album penetrates several layers of tissue.  The splatter pattern is kaleidoscopic evidence of moods through which this record has moved. The wound?  The first seconds of silence following the final note.  
 This book is great! It gives a shopping guide with specific brand names to choose while shopping and pages of recipes. I've tried alot of the meals and they are all delicious.  
 After completing the basic CHESS FOR JUNIORS book my son (6th grade) and I got UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS. This book is packed with the important "general rules" as applied to complete games, great analysis (very clear and understandable), and problems to find the best moves within the games. I love the "every move has a comment" idea found in this book. I recommend this book for anyone who is beyond being a beginner that really wants to improve their entire understanding of chess 
 Hill's book is an excellent overview of the Project Management Office(PMO) stages and functions.  It is well-organized and well-written, with each chapter following a consistent format and including a related function model for the topic being discussed.  I particularly liked:  o The PMO Competency Continuum that depicts the five stages in the evolution of a full-blown PMO (i.e.,Center of Excellence), and the functions, advantages and disadvantages associated with each stage  o The table depicting the 20 PMO functions, grouped within his five function categories: Practice Management, Infrastructure Management, Resource Integration, Technical Support and Business Alignment  o Good use of charts, diagrams, bullets, examples, etc.  o Recognition of the PMO's business integration function  Suggestion for future editions:  Correlate functions and processes to the Project Management Institute (PMI)'s terminology, phasing, etc.  A good desk reference!     
 This is an excellent translation of the various known texts including some of the more recent archaeological finds.  Ames' preface also provides a valuable context for the writings - historical, cultural and philosophical.  His insights into the Chinese culture, both past and present, prepares the reader well for the subsequent translations.  The distinctions between western modes of thought, with their deep divisions between the physical and spiritual, are contrasted with the Chinese philosophy of continuous change within all extant things.  For them there is no dichotomy - everything is defined by their roles and the ability to understand reality and truth as it is.  Also, while I cannot read Chinese, it was cool to have the original writings provided for all the translations.  Even if you've read the translations before, this book provides an excellent update to a literary/philosophical classic.  
 This book is wonderfull for people interested in beginning a breeding program.  It does not speak down to you for even thinking of breeding dogs, and gives you good information on each step you should take to become a responsible, respectable breeder 
 This outing from the cover band Novelle Vague satisfies immensely in many ways, and just plain misses in others.  If you are an old timmer who grew up on the originals (like me) then you may find this newly vamped bossa nova approach to 80s post-punk staples a fun filled romp down nostalgia lane.  It isn't for everyone, though, and a word of caution to those of you who are missing out by not having heard the originals (all brilliant in their own right) first.  The often covered Joy Division classic, "Love Will Tear Us Apart," gives us a warmer rendition than the bleak original, but not better, just different.  Of stellar mention is their fun, catchy cover of the DK's hc classic "Too Drunk to..." and the Clash's London-calling era ska-soaked "Guns of Brixton." I will also add that their cover of the insufferably boring "This is not a Love Song" (of disco-era post-Pistols Johnny Rotten PIL fame) gets a great face lift...upwards: Simply awesome!!  On the other hand, Nouvelle Vague miss almost entirely on the gothic realm, as best evidenced by their butchering of Andrew Eldritch's "Marian" (off the Sisters of Mercy's first LP, "First and Last and Always") and with their mediocre quickening of The Cure's "A Forest" (which seems to be popular in covering, especially with the techno / rave crowd).  Overall this is a good buy, but it does have a couple renditions that deserve a quick skip with a toggle of the fast forward button.  A better NV effort is showcased in their "Bande A Part" LP, where they do a fantastic cover of the power-punk-pop classic "Ever Fallen in Love," a former Buzzcocks masterpiece.  4 stars for effort and originality.  
 Get the CD version just out .  When I had to read this book in High School I found it excruciatingly BORING. But Alan Rickman did such a good job, now I think this story is BETTER than Wuthering Heights.  From AudioFile " The suffering that follows is mitigated somewhat by the ending, but more by the mastery of Alan Rickman's reading. At the start, Rickman senses the voice for each character in Hardy's fictional world, and he maintains each character's personality throughout. He even manages to project Hardy's subtle shadings of tone with the rhythm and tempo of his narration, throwing in a song here and there because, in spite of his gloom, there is a festive strain to Hardy, as well. If you have a hard time reading this classic English writer, this is how to do it. "P.E.F. (c) AudioFile, Portland, Maine. Yes and he can even do the womens voices without doing falsetto ! Rickman won the Best Talking Book or Talkie thing for this and deservedly so.  I enjoy talking books and often use them as I drive long distances and this is the best one I have heard so far. I hope Alan Rickman , or another English actor, reads some more Thomas Hardy books for us in future. 
 Both of these volumes are tremendous works illustrating a wide range of poetry from a wide range of voices. I love how the sections are delineated, and there is a wealth of information about poets, poems, schools of thought and poetics along with the actual poems. I learned a lot about poetry just by reading these two volumes. This is truly an example of wonderful, dedicated editing 
 Great book, I've read several books on the Templers, and Freemasons, It seems to me that they were trying to presearve something, Just wish I know what before I expire, I read about an ancient coin, that displayed the towers of hercules, a banner between the two that said in latin, The way of the future, way before Columbus, but anyway the line went threw our nations capital, What? maybe a new world Rome 
 A brilliant mixture of hip-hop beats with mild synth creating a perfect soundtrack for equally day and night 
 The book contains three episodes, a man who has lived in Okinawa and fired the (de facto at that time) national flag, a woman who has rejected the burial by the state of her hasband having been a member of the Self-Defense Force and the ex-mayor of Nagasaki City who has referred to the war responsibility of the Emperor, as well as a report on the very curious atomosphere prevailing in Japan on the death of the Showa Emperor. A reader could understand the true but hidden mentality of the Japanese from the contents explicitly and implicitly. The authour of course could have written the original in Japanese, but the fact that the work had to be translated itself has had a significance. I strongly recommend to read the work if you want to understand the Japanese who are now at the crossroad 
 Anyone wanting a good NT theology book should never pass up on Ladd's book. The book is nicely organized and arranged in a logical manner. The book covers practically every book and doctrinal issue in the NT. There are six major sections in the book in the following order: 1) The Synoptic Gospels; 2) The Fourth Gospel; 3) The Primitive Church; 4) Paul; 5) Hebrews and the General Epistles; and 6) The Apocalypse. The book is very scholarly but easy to read for the average seminarian. Ladd writes from an evangelical Baptist perspective but interacts with scholars outside that tradition. Many of his exegeses of certain key passages are convincing and he gives a fair hearing on interpretations that disagree with his. His Kingdom theology and "already/not yet" approach to redemptive-history colours some of his interpretations (esp. on eschatological matters). However, his arguments are cogent and persuasive. Especially valuable is his section on Paul's theology (pp. 395-614). His section on Paul can be a book in itself! Though this book was originally published in 1974, it is still far superior to the other evangelical NT theology books out there (e.g., Guthrie, Morris, Zuck/Bock). If you're a student of the Bible wanting to get a better knowledge of what the NT writers taught this book is the best place to start 
 To appreciate this book, you truly must clear your mind and concentrate on what O'Brien is saying instead of just what he's telling. Simply a brilliant book, but not for everyone 
 THERE WAS VERY GOOD ACTING BY ALL THE STARS IN IT. THE STORY WAS A LITTLE SLOW. I LOVE ROBERT DUVALL IN ANY MOVIE THOUGH. 
 It's a great product, I think you will like it.  My wife wanted some flannel sheeting and I found this for a great price.  They start off a bit firm but after a few washes behave very nicely.  You will enjoy them I'm sure.  They do wash well 
 I just wanted to say, I'm sorry to those who gave this book a low rating.  you really have missed out on some amazing things God can tell you through this book.  I have read this book and it changed my life - reminded me of the real order of things and led me to a deeper listening for God's voice.  The more you listen the more you will recognize and hear it. I also have 2 other friends who's lives changed after reading this book as well.  I'm talking major changes 
 This re-release of the first Chip Hilton book is a great start. They didn't gut the original stories and the updates are mild but appropriate. The books still have the great and timeless themes that attracted me when I  read the originals years ago. My kids will be reading these, I'm sure! 
 THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ACTION MOVIE EVER MADE!  JOHN WOO IS A MASTER DIRECTOR.  CHOW-YUN-FAT IS THE MAN.  THIS MOVIE HAS THE BIGGEST BODY COUNT IN ANY MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.  THIS IS ACTION FILM-MAKING AT ITS UTMOST FINEST.  DEFINATELY ONE FOR ANY HARD-CORE ACTION FANS COLLECTION 
 One of the best cd's ever recorded. and the mix is totally awesome   IT RULZ 
 I really enjoyed these CD's.  A very easy way to learn meditation.  Doctor Kornfield has a very relazed way of teaching meditation and makes you want to try meditation.  He teaches the basis of meditation in a very informative way and non-boring. I am just a beginner to meditation and finding that this series of CD's are well worth the money I paid.  I will definitely play these CD's over and over again.  I highly recommend 
 I bought this for my 18 month old daughter.  She loves it, but has a tendency to tip it over when she tries to ride on it.  It is much more difficult to steer and keep upright than her other ride on toys, but she is learning!  If you are a nervous mom, wait until your child is a little older to enjoy this, but it is soooo cute and she really loves the compartment (we call it the trunk) for her to put a stuffed friend to come along for the ride 
 Nobody likes homework these days. I can say not even I do. Well the book I read was How to Do Your Homework Without Throwing Up by Trevor Romian. The book was all about homework obviously, it also explains why it's good for you, the purpose of homework, and why it helps us in school. It also explains to you the emotions and feelings you might get when you're doing your homework. People might get sad, confused, frustrated etc. Then you have to think they didn't come up with homework just to bug us.    	I like this book because it's exciting and it's something I'm interested in. It's easy to connect in a way, because at times when I'm doing my homework I do get confused and think that homework is there for no reason and as your reading the book you can compare yourself to the book in several ways. I would recommend this book to people who like funny books but also books that you can connect to. If you like books that teach you a lesson in life, and what homework is good for, read this one!    
 If you're a fan of Martin Amis' writing, then you probably know what you'll get here. First-rate prose, sharp psychological insights, and devastating (and funny) commentary on life and humanity that strikes some readers as cold and clinical, but is in fact quite compassionate and at times even poignant.   As an essayist and reviewer, Amis is unmatched--his talents are perfectly suited to those forms. And his novels are great reading as well: both profound and enjoyable. Yet House of Meetings shares the one significant flaw that marks all the Amis novels I've read (and which another reviewer here touches on): his characters inevitably speak (or in this case, write) like Martin Amis the essayist. And just like the mismatched half-brothers of Success, the half-brothers who meet again in a Soviet gulag in House of Meetings regularly make Amis-like insights on their lives and the people they know. That one flaw in Amis' fiction doesn't stop me from enjoying, or recommending, his novels, including this one. The author's wit and insight and the quality of the writing more than pay back your reading time, flaws and all 
 I was lent this book to read but had to buy my own copy because it can't be all obsorbed the first time around. you'll have yourself going back to find more next time. What an incredible journey. A must read for those interested in military history.    
 "Blue skies, smiling at me," goes the Irving Berlin song, "Nothing but blue skies do I see."  Berlin thought that was a good thing, but Gavin Pretor-Pinney would not.  For him, clouds are there to be enjoyed, and they make that blue more beautiful by its being in the background.  He does not feel there is anything depressing about having "a cloud on the horizon" and he sees no reason that we should link clouds with catastrophe, as in "clouds of doom", or with ill-will as in "clouds of suspicion".  He feels clouds are underappreciated, and so a couple of years ago, he founded the Cloud Appreciation Society, complete with badges.  As he says, "Of course, an organization only exists when it has a website," and indeed the CAS has one, full of photographs and poems by members, a picture of the Cloud of the Month, and chat rooms, with this stated purpose: "If you've got something to tell us, we'd love to hear it. But only if it is about clouds. Otherwise we're not interested."  Pretor-Pinney would like us all to be cloudspotters, and has produced _The Cloudspotter's Guide: The Science, History, and Culture of Clouds_ (Perigee), a witty and informative volume for those who want to take an educated view of his favorite subject.  He emphatically agrees with John Constable, who could paint clouds like no one else: "We see nothing truly until we understand it."  The book cannot fail in its mission of increasing both understanding and seeing.  We start understanding things when we can categorize them, and over the years, observers learned there were differences in cloud types and they attached names to them.  The first person to take on this task did not do so until the nineteenth century.  Luke Howard, an English Quaker, in 1802 lectured his local scientific society on cloud types, and as was the Linnean fashion, sorted them into genera and species and gave them Latin names, like Cumulus and Stratus.  It was a good system, but different nations and regions started adding their own cloud types and cloud names.  The confusion was cleared up in 1896, the "International Year of the Clouds".  Serious meteorologists formed a "Cloud Committee" and published _The International Cloud Atlas_, sorting clouds into ten genera  accompanied by descriptions and photographs.  Each of the ten clouds has a chapter in Pretor-Pinney's book, complete with description and lore, and photographs by members of the CAS, along with their membership numbers.  For example, chapter one is on the Cumulus cloud, the low, puffy, detached clouds, the sort that children draw in their pictures: "Six year olds are generally rubbish at drawing, but being amongst the best cloudspotters in the world, they are actually quite good at drawing Cumulus."  To explain the formation of the Cumulus, the author cheerfully describes the process as compared to a lava lamp, and in the meantime explains lava lamp physics as well.  We think of clouds as filmy and light, but a typical Cumulus will have around 220 tons of water droplets in it.  Certainly, though, not all is seriousness here.  Seeing shapes in clouds is not just a child's game, and the author recommends it: "Clouds are for dreamers, and the contemplation of their shapes is a pursuit worthy of any cloudspotter... any cloudspotter who has become too sensible to see shapes in the clouds needs to re-evaluate."    Pretor-Penney has a great deal of fun with his hobby, fun that comes through in every chapter of his book.  For example, in investigating the mackerel sky (a type of Cirrocumulus), he goes to the biggest fish market in London to see which fish had lent its pattern of scales to the name.  He finds the mackerel sky within the scales of the king mackerel, but stops in his tracks when he realizes that the scales of the common carp reproduce Altocumulus stratiformis perlucidus, "soon to be known as a 'carp sky'".  Few other people could have traveled across the world to see a particular cloud, but you can read his report on the Morning Glory, a type of Stratocumulus that forms in northern Australia in the spring, a huge roll of a cloud that can be six hundred miles long.  It is favored by glider pilots who use it as surfers do an ocean wave.  There are many other interesting asides here, caught with enthusiasm and humor, within the meteorological rigor.  Many readers will want to keep their copy handy as it has "How to Spot..." guides for all the clouds, and how not to confuse them with others.  This is one of the most entertaining reference books ever 
 My 3 year old loves this book for the beautiful illustrations of the animals and the forest during Autumn. However, one night after we read it a bedtime, she looked over at me and said that she liked "how all of the animals took care of each other." If she can get this simple, yet crucially important lesson from a children's book, I would say that the author has gone above and beyond her intentions 
 As always with Amazon I recieved my purchase in perfect condition 
 I have read many travelogues, for example ones by authors such as Lawrence Durrell, Rebecca West, and Jan Morris.  I found this book to be of similar high quality.  The author gives information in an enjoyable format that relates to his own personal travel in the region.  His anecdotes on the retreat of the White Russian army from Novorossisk are interesting. The book gave me new information for an area that is often left out of other histories I have read about Byzantium and Eastern Europe.  Information about the lucrative Venetian slave trade  operating out of Tana was new to me and has never been mentioned in any other book about Venice or Byzantium that I have read.  The story of the Pontine Greeks living in Trebizond and their "Katastrofe" exodus from there filled in gaps of knowledge for me.  His discussion of Catherine the Great and her use of Cossacks and Jews to settle and develop the Don River region is fascinating.  The book does dwell quite a bit on Polish involvement in Odessa, but his digression on the existence of a Polish and Lithuanian federation that stretched from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea was an esoteric and curious pleasure for me to read.  I am passing the book along to several of my friends 
 This album has it all; it's got fantastic playing, it is extremely catchy, and very engrossing all at the same time. I have only recently begun to enjoy jazz, and I still love this album. There is nothing more that I can say that has not been said before, but I will say this; BUY THIS ALBUM! You will love it 
 Having been far too young to watch the first seasons as a kid (I had to pick my battles and the X-Files was at the time on the top of my I have to watch this list) I missed the first three seasons of this groundbreaking series.  I watched a lot of cop dramas in my house and growing up in NY, it was easy to see that NYPD Blue was not shot on location but Law&Order was.  I never really liked NYPD Blue though it in theory probably paved the way for this series to make it to the small screen at all.  Which segways hopefully into the awesomeness that is Homicide Life on the Streets, shot entirely on location in Baltimore...and hopefully doing justice to the feeling of that city as well.  Based on David Simon's excellent novel Homicide: A year on the Killing Streets (also recommended), the series follows the cops of the Baltimore homicide unit as they solve crimes and live their lives.    A few noteworthy things which set this series apart from many of the rest...the first two seasons were shot entirely in 16mm film and retain a gorgeous quality I somewhat missed in the later seasons.  The jump cut idea is introduced here, and while jarring at first, lends a uniqueness to the series as well.  And most importantly...because this is based on a book, which was based on true experience, the cliche's are almost totally out the window.  Utterly refreshing.  There's no "black cop" episode, no "black and white partner" episode in fact there are none of those typical "cop" archetypes in any episode.  The issue is brought up, and dealt with time and again throughout the series, but is never the focus of an episode.  That sets this apart.  There are technical issues with the DVD, most noteably the lack of closed captioning...so if that is an issue...it might be hard to follow the story.  Otherwise I would highly recommend this unconventional cop series 
 I already know some linear algebra, but not its applications.  I am trying to learn on my own.  I do * not * need comments for odd questions "That the student really should look this up on his own because it is not good to rely too much on answers."  I ordered the book so I would have answers to at least the odd problems.  I like the way the book asks questions that are not really too difficult but require knowing what is going on.  It allows me to gain the knowledge for something I do not know by looking at the answers (if they were all there) to the odd problems 
 The 3 published Mad Scientists books are my most favorite books from my youth.  I read each several times.  Since becoming a father and wanting to share these outstanding stories with my kids, I searched high & low for these books.  I finally stumbled upon the newly re-issued Mad Scientist Club book from Purple House Press while browsing the Tattered Cover book store in Denver.    To answer the below question from Scott who asked about a movie version of the books--the Wonderful World of Disney, a Sunday night series, did a TV version of the Strange Sea Monster of Stawberry Lake.  I belive the Disney version was called the Monster of Strawberry Cove 
 I think this is a great source of info for training your boxer.  It also deals with breed history and proper care, it's not all training.  If I were to choose just one book to deal with all aspects of the Boxer this would be it.  Lots of pictures and lots of info.  I also got the German Shepherd training book and was kind of expecting a lot of the information to overlap, but it didn't.  It was written by a Boxer lover, not just some dog lover 
 Among the best efforts of this badly underated actor.  Price had a glorious time with this movie.  Like in his Phibes movies his audience is kept cheering for him all the way.  The bad guys (critics) are gruesomely slain one by one in highly creative ways.  If you are a Shakspeare fan as am I, you should enjoy the carnage even more.  My personal favorite scene is the woman getting electrocuted while getting her hair done.   Unfortunately the movie is flawed by an ending much inferior to the Phibes movies.   Highly recommended 
 After seeing this brilliant film three times, I eventualy knew that I had to have the soundtrack. After listening to all of the CD'S lush and powerful tracks, I realized that this is Thomas Newman's best and most carefully composed score, because it so perfectly fits and aligns precisely with the film, its characters, and the mood of each scene. I am very disappointed that Oscar did not even consider this for a Best Original Score nomination. Not only the score, but the film as well should've received more acclaim because it truly was the best film of the year 
 A lot of it was self-explanitory for anyone with much sexual experiance, especially if your spouse is very open, as mine is, but there were things in here that both me and my wife got really exited about and are now part of our common repretoi 
 Much like his previous book, Muggles and Magic, this newest work by George Beahm is packed with interesting information and insights. Most of us, having general knowledge about mythology and folklore (and therefore understanding some of the clever connections and allusions Rowling makes in the naming of characters and items), sense that there are likely many references we don't quite get. Fortunately for us, Beahm has done all of the work required to make reading Harry Potter a far richer, more complex experience. From his exploration of the significance of names to his thorough catalog of the various attributes of the fantastic creatures that appear both in Harry Potter and world mythology, Beahm gets it all down in an extremely comprehensive and easy-to-read way.  One of the best things about this book is its layout. For example: this Guide has one of the best tables of contents that I've seen in a reference book of this sort, and the index is equally wonderful. If it's mentioned in a Harry Potter book and Beahm's explored its deeper meaning and connections to our world, a reader will easily find any creature, item, term, or character she's looking for. In Beahm's last book, I found myself somewhat distracted by the numerous sidebars and inserts. In Fact, Fiction, and Folklore in Harry Potter's World: An Unofficial Guide, the sidebars and inserts are perfectly placed--they are unobtrusive but won't get overlooked, which is all to the good: they're wonderful asides to the main text and only help to enhance the reader's understanding of the connections between Rowling's world and the more fanstastic aspects of our own. The illustrations are also wonderful, offering the eye a place to rest and setting off the main text in a whimsical manner.  Finally, Beahm again demonstrates his ability to write informational prose in a thoroughly engaging manner. We learn a good deal about a great number of things in this Guide--without feeling like we're sitting in on a World Mythology or Mythology in Literature seminar conducted by someone like Professor Binns. Although it may seem that it would be difficult to make anything connected with Rowling and Harry Potter boring, such is definitely not the case. Large chunks of information, no matter how interesting their original source, are difficult for me to take in unless the writer can balance the perfect style and tone with the content. Beahm is a natural at this.   In reading Fact, Fiction, and Folklore in Harry Potter's World: An Unofficial Guide, I learned all sorts of things I'd never even guessed at without realizing that I'd learned them. And that alone is the best reason to recommend this book: I have a far greater appreciation for the care that Rowling has taken in creating Harry Potter's world--a world that invites the sort of exploration that Beahm does so well. 
 Be sure to read "Fear Nothing" before reading this book.  Seize the Night is a solid sequel.  Similar to Fear Nothing 
 There was a sensational news story in July 1910.  It had to do with an American doctor who had murdered his wife and hidden the body in a gruesome fashion in London.  While lamentable and horrific, this was sadly not so extraordinary a crime.  What made it sensational was a transatlantic chase that could be reported by the new technology of shipboard wireless communication.  Such technology was still a wonder, and this was the first time such communication was so widely disseminated, as the world watched the chase at a distance.  The murder and the development of the electronic wizardry that allowed the resultant chase to be reported in real time are the two stories woven together in _Thunderstruck_ (Crown) by Erik Larson, whom many readers will remember for a similar storytelling style in _The Devil in the White City_.  Some readers are going to be more interested in the lurid murder tale, and others in the frustrating attempts to bring us into the age of radio, but both the stories are good ones, and they are united in the exciting climax of the chase across the Atlantic.  Doctor Hawley Harvey Crippen, a meek practitioner of homeopathy, suffered a spectacular mismatch when he married Belle Elmore, a voluptuous woman who was seeking some way of breaking from her married lover who was supporting her, and also of breaking into grand opera.  She was dissatisfied with his upkeep of her, and overtly took a lover, although the couple continued to give the appearance of concord in the home.  He, in turn, fell in love with his secretary, a woman who seemed genuinely to love the kindly doctor.  In January 1910, he ordered five grains of hyoscine hydrobromide from his usual pharmacy; the pharmacist trusted the affable doctor, but had to order the medicine anew, since the shop never had so much on hand.  Thereafter, Belle disappeared, and Crippen and his lover fled the country.  Guglielmo Marconi was a young man of Italian-Irish heritage, and he had done trial-and-error experimentation with devices that could carry signals wirelessly.  He obsessively tinkered with his small electronic gadgets, and with huge antennas, but also with making his fortune, fighting off patent infringement and subduing competitors.  He was so driven that he dealt unfairly with colleagues who were sincerely helping him in his goals, and he was insensitive to the women who were drawn to him.     The climax of the book is brisk and exciting, as Crippen and his disguised lover traveled across the Atlantic, unaware that the captain of their ship suspected who they were and had reported their presence.  The world got messages about what the murderer had for breakfast, for instance, or what jokes he has told.  Those on the ship were kept in the dark to keep the secret from the fleeing couple.  The world also thrilled as the chief inspector from London, who had interviewed Crippen in an initial investigation before foul play was suspected (and who had incidentally taken part in the investigations of the Jack the Ripper murders twelve years before), raced across the Atlantic in a faster vessel to apprehend his suspect.  Larson has brought his dual story into an unforgettable capture, and wraps everything up speedily thereafter.  It is quite obvious he has done extensive research on this story, not only about poisons and radio waves, but about sï¿½ances, the style of hair curlers at the time, and the dietary habits of the rich and famous.  Sex, murder, and radio turn out to be great foundations for a gripping book. 
 This book was on my summer reading list, and I was thinking that it  was going to be horrible, but it was the exact opposite. I love the book and enjoyed every minute that I read it! I love how Finney uses pictures in the book, it helps you to grasp the changes that occured in the scenery of Manhattan. 
 It's a great album, dynamic an itelligent. Group has made a good blend like Marlboro with Turkish  tobacco. But still, I think some tracks are a little bit overdriven with Turkish music.  It's a tasteful album which get  the same pleasure each time I listen 
 I know this book is 20 years old, so its not particularly surprising that most of the anecdote and stories seem old. Its all about Johnny Moss and Nick the Greek and Amarillo Slim and Doyle Brunson. Naturally there's a new posse in the world of poker today, Men the Master Nguyen, Phil Hellmuth , Poker Dick Cook.  and the brilliant Russell Rosenblum. The world of the world series of poker has changed much since this book was written in 1983, there remains a question even about how much longer Binions will host the world series and the there is a real possiblity that Bellagio will even buy the trademarked name.  This book advertises itself as a timeless cult classic, and as a period piece from 25 years ago, A. Alvarez captured a time and place. I wonder how much of this however will resound as novel to the poker player of today.  When Alvarez mentioned Stu Unger winning the world series, it left me wanting to read about how stu ungar moved from world champion to dying in a run down Vegas motel room. Or when he talked about Ted Binion running Binions,  the mind flashes to the fact that binion has since been murdered .Plenty of good advice in here for hold em play, of course the problem in gambling isn't usually knowing what to do, its being able to do it, to fight fatigue, to fight temptation to play too many hands, to summon up the courage to pitch aces when you know they have been cracked. The problem with the gamblig genre is that there just arent that many good books out there. Too many agents and publishers think they won't sell and bookstores tend to look down on gambling books as being anti-literary.  Snobbery in the bookstore world is a real problem, as anyone who has ever asked a proprietor if they carry the Racing Form on their mag rack will quickly find out 
 I was just tak'in a look see at what is still available from J.W. And felt compeled to write a little. this L.P. brings back such great memories partying in H.S. I got (the L.P.)it from Columbia house! It was the Months feature L.P. and I failed to tell them not to send it!!! imagine that. I wasn't even crazy about it when I first got it! I was young Freshman Yr., to young to (at first) understand the depth of feelings in this L.P. A Few years later I got it... and it STILL hits me with a solid Rock injection whenever I plug it in today! Its' plenty hard enough and yet is not afraid to have a soft side that I don't find cheesy at ALL! Emotionally/Musically/Soulfully I would put this on par with BAD Companies 1st L.P.) very different bands to be sure but energectically seem to be both in parody, I feel the exact same way about the B.C. L.P. today as well. Albeit J.Walsh can't sing as well (as B.Co.) it doesn't hold back the music or message.  GET THIS L.P. if it is the ONLY ONE you ever get! Then after that I would recommend "The Smoker you drink the player you get" which came out the year before in 73' after that I would say get "But seriouly folks" I see that several other good ones are only available for the big bucks now so don't delay! Anything else I could say has been said and broken down more throughly in other's comments than I need to re-cover.     
 An amazing book detailing the differences between global, international, and multinational companies while providing a new innovative way to approach business, the transnational way. Great for students and professionals alike 
 A modern, up to date and informative guide to audio post production techniques used in todays complex industry.   Hilary describes each step of the audio post production process, from a locked picture edit, through to final mixing and deliverables.   Chapters on editing give the reader a unique insight into how a sountrack is created and prepared for the mix, using techniques that Hilary has acquired from working on many feature films and television programmes.  A must have book for anyone wanting to gain knowledge and understand sound in the modern film and television industry 
 For those interested in serial killers or in understanding the human condition in some of its darkest forms, this book offers a number of wonderful insights. Details from interviews with many of the most notorious killers of our time including John Wayne Gacey, Henry Lee Lucas & Karl "Kropsey" Morgan are both fascinating and truly repulsive 
 I have been watching anime on-and-off since 1992 and it has only been this past year that I have been able to watch all of the animated versions of the Ah!/Oh! My Goddess! franchise.  Now I've become a fan that needs to know more but the anime can only tell you so much.  That's when I decided to go straight to the source and pick up this manga, which I've never done before as don't normally read manga!  This is Volume 1 of Dark Horse's re-release of the Ah!/Oh! My Goddess! manga series by Kosuke Fujishima; now featuring the manga industry standard right-to-left reading direction which I still have to get acclimated to.  Since it is the first volume of the series, the character designs are still in it's early development but characters are still recognizable.  If you've seen the new AMG tv series then you'll recognize some of the plot used plus the stuff in-between that wasn't used.  Overall good stuff.   
 The book Fahrenheit 451 takes a good look into what could have been an alternate outcome of WW2 if the Germans had won. the book takes place in a society where everyone is meant to be happy and equal, with no other thoughts entering their minds. Books, the main type of individual thought which is being erased at this time are burnt when seen. The main character is a new type of fireman, one who burns down houses with books in them, rather than saving them.  The writing in this book is amazing, parts of it you have to read twice just because of the amount of visual and symbolic words used. The book also gives a strong look into how people think, and what the world could come to. Ray Bradbury is a great writer, and although none of the situations he wrote about came true, the book will stand the test of time forever as a classic.   
 Death on the Nile is an adaptation from one of the longer novels of A. Christie. Death...was adapted in the 70s, but if you want the truth, that movie sucked. And it sucked because of Mia Farrow and Peter Ustinov. David Suchet is the only actor to portray Hercule Poirot greatly and naturally. Ustinov and Finney both seemed either too stiff or ill-fit for the character we grew to know and love by reading the books.   The A&E version of the story is thoroughly enjoyable and is my favorite A&E Poirot movie. The story itself is ingenious and the guilty could have easily gotten away with it if not for a couple of eye witnesses and of course, the little grey cells of Poirot 
 What a great way to introduce our kids to Dr. Seuss.  It can be interactive or not-so, great for toddlers or babies listening to someone else make the noises.  My 2 year old has loved this book since we introduced it to her around 19 months.  She can remember most of the sounds almost exactly-it's awesome 
 This book is excellent.  I bought it at the exhibit of the same name, that was put together by the Phillips Collection.  It was a great show and this is the only way to see it now.  Dove was the first abstract painter, at the same time as Kandinsky but having never seen Kandinsky's work until several years later 
 If you read one you'll want to read the all serie. It's just a great mystery nove 
 I had so many questions and this book has answered them all! I have had it wire bound because I am refering to it so much.Just can't recommend it highly enough

 I have read this book since I was 11 years old. not only did it teach me the constellations, it gave me the insights that everyone must know so that they will not lose faith in God. That the Bible is true because most of the stars ancient names can be found and were used in the Bible to convey messages in one word. Every now and then when there are special events in the sky I try to decipher what it mean and what God is trying to tell. It's the second book I have always loved after the Bible in my 25 years of living 
 I bought this watch some time ago and my 9-year old loves it.  The design of the watch is interesting...instead of a second hand, its a clear circular plastic disc with gecko designs on it, so that as it turns, the geckos rotate around the watch face.  Some months after I bought it, that disc must have loosened and came off.  I emailed ProSport Watches and they sent a new watch together with a postage paid envelope for me to return the old one in - what an outfit!  The new one works fine and my daughter was delighted all over again 
 All of Tammy Powley's books are filled with helpful information and instructions. This book is no exception. Beside the many interesting and unique designs, she offers invaluable information on seed beads and related techniques. The instructions and their illustrations are very clear and easy to follow.   
 Granted, this production was made for television and they were obviously intent on keeping it a play and the set design as such. However, it certainly would have been a better "film" if it were given the budget to be so. A prime example being "Merchant of Venice" with Robert Deniro and Jeremy Irons. Just the wonderful cinematography and attention to detail alone give Shakespeare that extra touch of realism that makes for a truly satisfying film. "King Lear" could have benefitted from the same. In fact, even as a play, I found the sets simplistic, clunky, and distracting. HOWEVER, the acting is wonderful and that really is the main reason for watching this in the first place 
 This was my first time reading a Jane Green novel and I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish. BABYVILLE by Jane Green was an awesome story about babies and "thirty-something parenthood".  The story focuses on three characters. Julia, Maeve, and Sam are as different as night and day.  Julia, married to her loving husband Chris is feeling unfullfilled in her marriage after she gives birth to their son George. Maeve is a single woman living the good life, satisfied with her career, and sees no relationship or kids in her near future. Julia has been with her live-in boyfriend Mark for six years, but they are by no means "in love", but simply "in like". The two feel that if they have a baby, that will change the direction their relationship is going... to bad they are having problems with conceiving and that brings even more strain into their already dwindling relationship.   The book is broken down into three parts, each part telling each woman's story. Maeve's "I don't want a relationship, and the sight of a stroller makes me break out into a rash" attitude is quickly tested with an unexpected pregnancy. Sam thinks that running off with her friend's sexy husband is the answer to her depressing life of being a full-time mother.  This is another book where the characters were well thought out, and well brought together in the end. Jane Green has truly taken chick-lit to another level with this and I will definitely be picking up her other books. 5 Stars for BABYVILLE! 
 This book is one of my childrens' favorites.  From the time they were both too little to know their days of the week they still chimed in when the caterpillar ate and ate and was "Still Hungry" until they could say the days of the week with no problem, this book will forever be a staple among my families' collections.  The illustrations are Eric Carle's usual terrific array of colors and creatures. This book is also great for nursery school teachers to read and explain to their children the beautiful transformation from caterpillar to butterfly by using live caterpillars as an educational tool 
 This was read and enjoyed by all five members of our family (ranging in age from 5 to 40+).     It sparked interesting conversations about the Congo region and the plausability of Mary's stories (could you really scratch a hippo with an umbrella?).  This book also prompted the two adults of the family to find a copy of Mary Kingsley's own biography to read.  
 Having read Tinkering Toward Utopia for one of my graduate classes in administration at the GSE at Rutgers, I would summarize that the book is excellent, but a little bit dated.  Tyack & Cuban present a well-done overview of the American educational system, from its beginnings in the early 20th century through the mid-1980's.  Their theme, "tinkering toward utopia," is an interesting take on addressing school reform throughout the century and sheds light on the problems and pitfalls of "overpromising" and "hyperbole" that have existed--and continue to exist--in American education.  Overall, the text is easy to read and is replete with well-developed examples.  My only caution is that although the ideas presented continue through and are valied in modern times, the examples and data contained in the work are, for lack of a better word, dated--11 years in public education, especially with 5+ of those years overshadowed by NCLB, is a long time of increased levels of accountability that are missing in what could be "a century (and a little more) of public school reform."  One would hope that a revised edition be published in the near future with a chapter or two specifically devoted to those last 5 years of the 20th century and the transition into the 21st.  However, overall, the text is excellent and highly informative 
 Of course this is a great reference, and with each edition, it gets better.  Neophytes should not be scared off by the massiveness of the book.  In fact, it's Core Collection and Four-Star-Plus-Crown features make it a good place to get an overview of jazz, and sort out what to buy from the thousands of jazz recordings available. One thing to keep in mind, though:  reviews, no matter how authoratative, are opinions.  Some of the four-star recordings here are ones that I wouldn't give a second listen to.  Some of my all-time favorites rate only 2 or 3 stars.  Not that I'm right, but tastes do differ.  On the whole, I think there is a bias toward the more experimental, avant-garde recordings.  This actually makes for a good counterpoint to the hatchet job Ken Burns and Wynton Marsalis did in their PBS series, but still, it is a bias 
 Trace Adkins has set them up and knocked them down once more! Can Trace ever produce any music that sounds bad? His low deep bass voice continues to tickle our ears and the message of the songs he chooses to put together on cd continue to proclaim loud and strong that he loves everything in life from his dog to his woman to his God!   I strongly recommend that everyone has Trace's latest CD in their collection! A big ten-four in my CD player 
 This is a great bio of a great company.  Though it is somewhat dated, this book will set the standard for every deep inquiry into how McDonald's operates.  It is simply a remarkable story.  In 1954, salesman Ray Kroc had traveled from Chicago to San Bernardino, California to visit a local restaurant, which was called "McDonald's Famous Hamburgers".  Its owners had bought 8 of his Multimixers; with five spindles, he calculated, those Multimixers could churn out 40 milkshakes every few minutes.  Why, he wondered, did they need so many?  Arriving just prior to the restaurant's opening, Kroc parked his car outside, and waited for customers to arrive.  What he saw left him thunderstruck:  it was like an assembly line for food that was affordable, good-tasting, and fast.  The restaurant was also very clean, the service friendly.  Kroc spent that evening with the owner-creators of restaurant, Mac and Dick McDonald, discussing the mechanics of their system.  The following day, with a business plan in his mind, Kroc secured the exclusive right from the McDonald brothers to franchise their fast-food system in the U.S.  Irrepressibly optimistic, Kroc was 52 and a veteran of several ventures in the food industry.   McDonald's was not the first fast-food restaurant chain:  there was A&W Root Beer, Dairy Queen, and scores of others.  Each depended on the use of the automobile, in which suburban families could travel to obtain a convenient and inexpensive meal in a clean setting.  As part of the contract with the McDonald brothers, Kroc had agreed to follow the basic model of their original restaurant, though changes could be approved in writing.  (That would prove an enormous problem later on.)  Where Kroc differed from his competitors was in the franchise system that he created.  His approach was long-term, based on what he judged to be equitable relationships with suppliers and the owner/operators of McDonald's franchises. Not seeking to make a quick profit, he charged relatively lower startup fees from carefully selected franchisees.  Kroc's business model included:  1) A gradual, restaurant-by-restaurant expansion to maintain control over restaurant standards and design; 2) Owner/operators who were expected to act as local entrepreneurs and were directly involved in the management of the individual restaurant; 3) The development of supplier relationships based on trust and the promise of future growth together; 4) A relentless focus on experimentation to enhance operational efficiency; 5) Consistent training and monitoring of personnel to maintain the company's philosophy of QSC&V (quality, service, cleanliness, and value).  Profits of the McDonald's chain came as a direct percentage of its franchisees' gross sales.   While certain aspects of the model were tweaked - from the early 1960s, corporate revenues came to be based largely on leasing fees from franchisees on McDonald's property - Kroc's basic structure and practices survived.   As Kroc wrote:  "My belief was that I had to help the individual operator succeed...His success would insure my success."  The same logic applied to his suppliers.     For their part, McDonald's competitors tended to treat their franchisees like captive customers rather than trusted partners.  For example, Dairy Queen and Tastee Freeze became suppliers to their franchisees, forcing them to buy equipment and other products at a profit for the corporate offices, in effect creating a structural conflict of interest.  Not only did this divert the attention of the central headquarters from maintaining the quality and operational efficiency of their restaurants, but it frequently led to price gouging for less than optimal equipment, which undermined the loyalty of franchisees over the long term.  Moreover, they sold "territorial franchises" for huge initial profits to local businessmen, relinquishing control over large geographical areas, which often led to the neglect of standards and brand consistency.  Finally, their relations with outside suppliers tended to be short-term, based more on cost savings than on quality or innovation within the system.   Over time, the McDonald's chain grew up as a kind of ecosystem or coalition of partners, in which the interests of its members - the central headquarters, the owner/operators, and the suppliers - coincided over the long term.  Suppliers were also encouraged to innovate:  to perfect the pre-frozen french fry, for example, Fred Simplot invested over $3.5 million (!) of his own funds; as a reward (upon success), the Simplot Company grew into the world's largest supplier of potato products.   In the same way, it was owner/operators who invented some of the most popular new menu items, including the Big Mac, the Filet-O-Fish sandwich, and the Egg McMuffin, which eventually were offered in all McDonald's restaurants.   Unfortunately, the book does not go much beyond this promising beginning.  While this made for a cohesive system that was self-reinforcing and -improving, it also complicated the task of managing it from the national headquarters of the McDonald's Corporation.  For any new policy, McDonald's execs have to convince franchisees and suppliers that it is in their interest to implement it.  As the saying goes, "if it doesn't happen in the restaurants, it doesn't happen."  For years, the company reacted to outside pressures, though this is now changing with new proactive policies.  Furthermore, as McDonald's grew into the world's largest restaurant chain and indeed into a cultural force, it became a lightening rod for criticism.  The accusations of activists have taken a heavy toll on the McDonald's brand.  For example, McDonald's had become a specific target of anti-globalist vandalism during the 1999 meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle.  Other critics included Jose Bove, the organic farmer who achieved world renown for his role in the destruction of a McDonald's restaurant in the French countryside.  Finally, for many the moniker "Mc" had become synonymous not only with low quality and cheapness, but also with the American form of capitalism.  This represents a reversal of the wholesome, family-oriented image that the company had long nurtured.  The company is struggling to deal with these challenges to its brand at the moment.  Even more important, the company's strategy for growth - just planting more and more restaurants - has ceased to function as well as it used to:  there are too many McDo outlets so they compete with eachother in addition to other brands.  Now, the company is attempting to attract new customers and get old ones to buy more at each visit.  While this is working with menu changes for healthier fare (which mothers, many of whom did not like the old menu, feel good about buying when they come with their kids) these issues represent major challenge for the future, in particular the distrust of the brand that has become almost visceral.  Nonetheless, this book covers the basics, to about the mid 1980s, with genuine excellence.  It is well written and does not pull too many punches though it was authorised by the company.    Recommended 
 A good book if you use Unix, Linux or Macintosh.  Since the authors put a lot of emphasis on software that is distribution restriction free there is little in the book about Mapping Hacks for Windows based programs.  If you are a Windows user you should still get this book but do not buy it new.  Its not worth thirty dollars to you, buy it used.  
 I was blown away by DERILECTION  OF DUTY, written and read by H.R. McMaster . . . though written some 10 years ago, it is perhaps even more relevant now than it was then because of the Iraq conflict.  McMaster, a West Point graduate, thoroughly researched the decisions that led to the conflict in Vietnam . . . he points out that we were repeatedly lied to as a nation, not only by President  Johnson, but by Robert McNamara, Maxwell Taylor, and a whole  host of other individuals.  In retrospect, I'm glad that "only" 58,000 Americans died from that conflict . . . but what scared me the most in listening to this book was that we seem to be heading in the same direction!   
 I am the Curator of the Pfeifer Collection of Classical American Photography in Zrich, Switzerland and previously to this, the Assistant Director of the Paul Strand Archive. I have been writing about photography since 1985. Since it was published, I have used Rosenblum's book extensively. It is the first source book I go to when doing my research 
 for us amateaur artists who want inspiration to create great works of art.  This book shows the details of the human body and how great artists drew from live and dead bodies as they create the greatest masterpieces in art history 
 My 6 & 4 year old homeschooled children barely even know we have started school time each morning.  They enjoy our grammer lesson over breakfast - 1 lesson per day from the book. I guess we could do more as they do not take long, but I like to give my kids the chance to think about the things we have discussed. I also think the repitition another day is benificial too. If my children have memorized the definition or poem well, we tend not to repeat it 3 times that day.  I read a previous reviwers comments about how boring it was to study nouns for so many lessons, but that comment was made before this parent had actually completed these lessons.  In actual fact within these lessons your child will learn many other things:  Family relationships, days of the week, months, seasons, which months are in each season, several poems will be memorized, some oral usage, rules for capitalization, they will be encouraged to speak in proper sentences, they will learn to write their address, you will read stories, narrate pictures, and if your child is like mine he/she will retain it all.  We are currently at lesson 123 and I wish Jessie Wise had a follow up volume for when we reach 200.  I would buy it 
   The early buzz on this debut novel serves up terms like: "poetic intensity"; "strikingly beautiful prose style"; "unerring instinct for storytelling"; "a startling accomplishment"; and "lushly talented".  I will state emphatically that Mr. Cunningham's first novel is all that and much more.  This is a literary novel in the finest sense of the word, magnetic and seductive from first word to last.   Asher Witherow's story is told in first person.  Young Asher is the only child of Welsh immigrants.  His mother, Abicca, is strong, matriarchal.  Father David works in the Black Diamond Mines circa the 1860s.  Life is harsh and sometimes cruel for folks living in the dreary confines of the Contra Costa County California mining country.  Miners work long hours below ground and their children join them at a very young age.  Young Asher is no exception.  He's a bright boy, curious and irrepressible.  Death is witnessed at every turn, and stoically accepted as a necessary part of life in hard times.  Asher's outlook is influenced by a young ministerial apprentice, Josiah Lyte, who wishes for the boy a better life.  Friends Thomas Motion and Anna Flood bring life-changing influences to Asher's world.  Present throughout is a strong sense of time and place, beautifully expressed.   The elderly Asher recounts his life in retrospect.  His own words state best what life has been.  "...I know the great black hole won't receive me till I've tied my guts into sailor's knots over regrets and dreams and other torments I'm helpless to alter."   It's impossible to adequately review such excellence.  I've given you the bare essence of The Green Age of Asher Witherow.  Readers who appreciate fine literary fiction or the classics simply must read this book.  Those who enjoy American history and well written tales will find it exemplary.  This is a book to be savored, written by a gifted wordsmith.  It has my highest recommendation.      
 Like Walter Trout, this American guitarist has enjoyed sucess in Europe  while still unknown at home. He can boogie with the best (old ZZ Top,  Foghat, and Savoy Brown at their LOUDEST)while mixing in some mean sounding  slow blues.  His slide playing sounds similar to Johnny Winter, and his  lead guitar sounds a lot like Billy Gibbons of the Tres Hombres/Fandango  era.  While his lyrics have no deep meaning, listen carefully and you'll  have a few laughs (he definely writes with a sense of humour!) This CD has  14 original tunes, 72 minutes and not a dull moment 
 The ease of using this machine is fantastic.  They thought of everything.  I love it.  The only problem is the noise it makes when I go over fringe on my carpet and too tight of a space.  So, I've learned to vacuum a new way.  Still it was well worth the price and the suction for the extensions are incredible. I would purchase another one 
 Trane and cherry are the perfect foil for each other. As far as this type of music goes, this is one of the best albums. This is much like a Coleman album with Coltrane sitting in. The musical interplay on "The Blessing" is outstanding. It's interesting to hear Coltranes soprano sax here, the first time he played it on an album I believe. This is a very important album in the history of Jazz, it is wort getting for that fact alone. Some of my friends who do not like Jazz, especially this type, actually like this album. If you want to explore the music of John Coltrane and Don Cherry as individual artists there are some better choices though. Like most of the music Coltrane was involved with he makes a very bold musical statement. Also a nice version of "Bemsha Swing" 
 FIRST THOUGHTS - -     This movie is among the greatest 100 minute entertainment fests in existence. "9 to 5" reaches and touches everybody, both male and female somewhere personal and strangely satisfying. Though the plot is great and really moves, it is the smart "fantasy-revenge" ideas, dialogue and strong characterizations that keep this from becoming mean-spirited and thereby enable this movie to work so well for a diverse audience.   We need to salute Director/Screenwriter, Colin Higgins first. Higgins was the Screenwriter for "Harold and Maude", "Silver Streak" and "Foul Play", picking up a Golden Globe nomination for "Foul Play" in 1978. All of Higgins films have an air of sophistication and display a refreshing respect for the audience particularly in avoiding the obvious mean-spirited cliches that many of his films' topics' encompass. Also, Editor Pembroke J. Herring who was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Editing and also edited "Ground Hogs Day", did an amazingly seamless job of keeping "9 to 5" so coherently glued together. Herring was nominated for "Best Editing" for; "Tora! Tora!Tora!", 1970, "Bound For Glory",1976, "Out Of Africa", 1985 and edited many other excellent comedies and dramas. Higgins and Herring worked together on a number films all of which turned out the better for their contribution and "9 to 5" is one of them.   The three female leads all embody some type of stereotype. Lily Tomlin, as Violet Newstead is the widow with four children, going it alone and trying to break into the male dominated executive world of big business for the past 12 years - UNSUCCESSFULLY. She is confident and capable but she is a woman in a man's world, so she is very dissatisfied with the treatment she has been getting by the male establishment embodied through F. Hart [Dabney Coleman]. Jane Fonda, as Judy Bernly, is in the middle of a divorce in which her no-good husband, Dick, played deftly by Lawrence Pressman, left her for his secretary. Judy is now entering the workforce unprepared and for the first time and especially unprepared for the living embodiment himself, F.Hart. Dolly Parton as the delightful Doralee Rhodes, who F.hart chases round and round the office and even tries getting to conventions that do not exist all for a good time - HIS, examplifies how office rumors can ruin peoples' reputations and of course by the living embodiment himself. That's F.Hart of course and he is the bane of these three "innocent women" and as we see, represents most everything that is wrong in their lives as they see it. BTW, Dolly Parton in this role was nominated for an "Oscar", "Best Song", and 3 "Golden Globes", includeing "Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy".   This film could not get off the ground without a worthy adversary to these very potent femme fatales in training. Dabney Coleman as Franklin Hart or just F.HART, delivers an oscar worthy effort in his role as the living embodiment of almost every rotten thing a man in charge can do to women under him at the office. He is "his" 3 "GIRLS" reason for being the way they are, at least throughout the film. Coleman very generously lends himself to the same type of role Carrol O'Connor did in "All In The Family" as a means of illustrating that some things are clearly and obviously wrong and need to be changed. Comedy and Cliches are powerful tools for evoking awareness and change and "9 to 5" serves that cause well, chiefly through the utterly despicable nature of Coleman's character. Man or woman, we all enjoy Coleman's comeupance and so will you.   My favorite scenes are the three completely different fantasies our heroines relay to each other while under the influence of marijuana. Naturally, these flights of fancy all involved some overdue and elaborate revenge against F.Hart. Even such animated Disney characters as "Snow White" make an appearance in Tomlin's depiction of Hart's demise. Naturally, the reality nearly repeats Tomlin's fantasy on the very next day, which leads our heroines to stealing a corpse, evading the police, kidnapping and much, much more.   The scenes and gags in this film all further the plot and just dove-tail so nicely and so entertainingly together that it is over all to soon. We are left wanting more without realizing we have just sat for over 100 minutes and the issues and conflicts motivating the characters and fueling the film's plot have been resolved.   This is a terrific black comedy. Our characters [3 female leads] gain our empathy as they enter into a kind of twilight zone where both their personal survival and convictions stretch these women and allow their characters to show what they are made of and achieve both personal growth and unexpected satisfaction. Their foil, F.HART after showing all how despicable he was, literally plunges into the abyss as if sent to purgatory and then hell for his misdeeds against women as the plot unfolds. "REEL JUSTICE", tidy and quick!! The topic and the settings have aged very well and even after a quarter century this film in no way seems dated.   --* THE CAST --* Colin Higgins  - Director / Screenwriter   Jane Fonda  - Judy Bernly  Lily Tomlin  - Violet Newstead  Dolly Parton  - Doralee Rhodes  Dabney Coleman  - Franklin Hart Jr.  Sterling Hayden  - Tinsworthy  Elizabeth Wilson  - Roz  Henry Jones  - Hinkle  Lawrence Pressman  - Dick  Marian Mercer  - Missy Hart    --* THE AWARDS --*  Best Song (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Academy    Best Actress- Musical or Comedy (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden Globe    Best Original Song (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden Globe    New Star of the Year - Female (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden Globe     DVD FEATURES:   It is widescreen [1.85:1] and much clearer than the VHS release. The Disney characters in Violet's fantasy demonstrate this obvious color and clarity improvement over the video release. It has 1 trailer and of course scene selection and is available on the same DVD in either English or French with English or Spanish subtitles or no subtitles at all [of course]. Naturally, some interviews and a neat featurette would be nice but again this is a large improvement over the old faded video releases.   FINAL THOUGHTS - - This wonderful film is highly recommended and "9 to 5s" entertainment value stands up very well to repeated viewings and the passage of 26 years.   
 This book is unusual in that it is told entirely through poetry.  Billie Jo is a fourteen-year-old with a lot weighing on her mind.  First there's the fact that her father wanted a son but got her instead.  Second is that she and her parents are living in Oklahoma during the Great Depression and, more important for Billie Jo, the dust bowl crisis.  No rain is falling in Oklahoma, which means that no crops are growing.  Farmers like Billie Jo's father are growing poorer and poorer while horrible dust storms sweep through their farms and destroy everything in their paths.  Billie Jo's one escape and pleasure is playing the piano, and it seems that she might even be able to help her family out earning money by doing it.  Then horrible events leave Billie Jo without a mother and without the use of her hands.  She and her father must learn to live together, support each other, and survive this new tragedy on top of the old troubles.  This book was a really quick read because of the format.  I liked being able to get into Billie Jo's thoughts and to see how she was feeling about her situation.  This was a terrible time in United States history, and this book showed how regular people were affected by the dust bowl disaster.  The story was very sad, of course, but I think that's the way life was 
 Ann K. Lindsay's book is a revelation! The title on the front cover reads "Watercolor - A New Beginning." And that's exactly what I experienced - a new beginning.    After years of formal art training, this  Advertising Art Director is learning a whole new way of seeing via Ann  Lindsay's holistic approach.    I've always loved and admired watercolor  and never thought I'd be proficient enough at it.    Ann's fresh teaching  approach has totally turned around that negative thinking.    This book is  a 144 page one-on-one Ann Lindsay watercolor workshop!    I recommend it  highly 
 We love this train table and the train set that it comes with.  It has everything you need for hours of fun.  This was a Christmas gift for our 21 month old and he literally spent all of his free time (when we weren't eating or opening other presents) Christmas day playing with this table.  And so far it has proven to be very durable.  We know this because now my son loves to do nothing more than to sit or try and stand on this table to play.    The 3 bins that store underneath are wonderful.  They are large and make for very easy clean up at the end of the day.  We highly recommend this train table! 
 I really enjoyed this book. I plowed through it in 2 days because I couldn't put it down.  Don't look for any deep symbolism or meaning here - it's pure entertainment.  The main characters are well drawn, and the plot interesting - a Chinese woman and her estranged American husband trying to solve a murder and theft of artifacts at an archeological dig.  Liu Hulan and David Stark are an intense, powerful couple, and you are drawn into their anguish in the first few pages.  Lively supporting characters at the dig site make the book even more fun.  The plot twists and turns, changing your opinion of the characters multiple times before the book's fantastic finish.  I did learn some things about Chinese culture and politics, but they were overshadowed by the luminous characters and gripping action 
 This book shows the diversity and applicability of TOC in a very accessable format.  An excellent read 
 The wealth of information contained in The Professional Chef's Techniques of Healthy Cooking is "must have" for the dedicated healthy kitchen.  Each topic is fully discussed, and a full set of appendices offers quick access to a variety of nutritional and food prep tables.  Recipes included in the book prepare large volumes of food in most cases, but they provide good general guidelines, cooking techniques and ideas for the creative cook.  First rate photography illustrates the versatility of a healthy diet and adds considerably to the volume's visual appeal.  The comprehensive information in this beautiful book is the perfect "go to" reference -- I couldn't recommend it more highly 
 The ending of this book is the best part of the whole book.  This story gives hope when disaster strikes, and shows that love wins over all.  It's a happy beginning, with disaster striking, and you think the worst for the main two people, until the end.  To think that two people could love each other enough not to forget about one another for 3 years is inspiring, and gives you hope 
 I have 4 kids and moms are always telling me that you do not even wipe off the pacifiers when they drop on the floor after baby # 2 comes along. Not me this product is awesome. I feel so much better cleaning my babies toys and pacifiers in this machine. This is what I now buy for every baby shower I go to 
 Sibelius symphonies are great towering masterpieces.With Barbirolli in total command the Royal Philharmonic are in terrific form here.I do not want to add anything more to what other reviewers have already commented.I wish to recommend Sir John Barbirolli's complete set of Sibelius Orchestral works with The Halle Symphony Orchestra on the EMI label.Forget the stereotyped statement that The Halle orchestra was a regional one(implying it is not top grade?!!!)and trust your ears only.You will be richly rewarded.Also get Sir John Barbirolli's set of Delius Orchestral works performed by The Halle Orchestra-another marvellous set. Another Stereotyping I want to debunk is calling Sibelius a Nationalist composer and that his music reflects Finnish landscape,etc,etc.Well I am from India and I can truly vouch that some of his melodies resemble Indian Ragas!Some are reminiscent of the Great Vedic Hymns!I assert from this standpoint that Sibelius is a truly universal composer.If Sibelius is to be called a Finnish composer,I can accept it only if Beethoven is called a German Composer! 
 At first, I found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a Christian and a catechist in the Catholic Church. Yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story, especially since I work as a mental health professional. As I keep reading, I discovered that it wasn't sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope, of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child, and of the intrusive nature of the media. I particularly liked the strength Mariah showed during this conflict, despite her past history of nervous breakdown. And I like the way the character of Ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man. The secondary characters were all wonderful, in particular Mariah's mother and the lawyers on both side. I thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story.   As with all Picoult books, this was a deep and heavy novel which wasn't easily breezed through, but it was definitely a compelling and awesome book to read!  
 James Herriot once again takes you on a magical journey through his whimsical hamlet of Yorkshire Dales, stealing your heart at every stop along the way. Anyone who picks up this book will be immediately captivated by the depth of love and respect for animals that embodies all of Herriot's books. Every character you meet, be it human or animal, will tug your heartstrings in a manner that you never expected from such a humble book whose clear honesty parallels that of the other books in an unforgettable series. You don't have to be an animal crazed lover like me to enjoy the simple joys of this book- it is definitely a cherished read, you won't regret it 
 "A Theory of Justice" presented a conception of justice (justice as fairness) in the social contract tradition of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and Kant. In "Political Liberalism" Rawls corrects an oversight in Justice as Fairness; he attempts to apply the idea of toleration to political philosophy by recognizing the fact of reasonable pluralism. Caution: Meant only for those who wish to understand political philosophy 
 If you have a mid-sized Jeep Cherokee, you NEED this book, especially if you plan to drive it off-road or plan to modify it! The book is layed out in a logical order and is surprisingly thorough! The pictures are very detailed and there are more of them than I expected. Where Eric got some of the things he has pictured here, I do not know. I'd go so far as to say that if you have a question about any modification or what mods would be appropriate for your driving style, this book will likely have what you need to know before you start. EVEN which models, by year of production, may be appropriate for what you want to do. I was impressed also by the technical things, what to avoid, how to repair, pro's and cons of many mods, manufacturer recommendations, and tips for the install of the components that may otherwise be overlooked by the manufacturer's directions.     Overall, I'm impressed with my copy and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is even curious about these tough little vehicles.  P.S.  No, I'm not done with mine, and NO, you can't borrow it. You need one for yourself! This Amazon deal is the best I've seen for this book. Buy one today 
 You can't miss your soulmate, someway some how you'll fall into each other's lap, recognize each other and that will be that.... that's a big part of her message.  Overall, this is a great book on how to change yourself and your habits to bring love to you. She stresses that everyone's experience will be different and that you've got to be you. Kathryn covers things from A to Z and has bunches of little breakout sections with step by step instructions on how to get through certain issues.  I liked chapter 5 about how to get over your past partners. I also liked that she has a ten week program in the back if you want to read this with a bunch of your friends.  There's not a lot about the mechanics of dating... Mostly that it's a process that everyone has to go through.   I'd recommend his book for someone that's frustrated with the dating scene or just getting back into it after a long absence. It's very good at adjusting your viewpoint towards yourself and the person sitting across from you. 
 Unbelievable. I'm not a fan of Mastodon, but I have to admit that this band is truly amazing. No wonder they're that popular and even grammy nominated. And the artwork is gorgeous.  
 I was fifteen years old at the time. I just learned chess the year before. This book does a very good job of explaining the craziness, the excitement, and the drama of the match. The book covers the major and minor characters well. The book uses the match as a microcosm to illumine the political environment at the time. The writing is crisp and thoughtful. The explanation of the individual games was kept to a minimum. I enjoyed the authors' other works, so I had high expectations and the book met them. I strongly recommend the book.  
 good fabric and nice size.  great for the price, free 
 Kitten's First Full Moon is sweet, energetic and visually interesting. The tale is classic as it tells of determination, folly, woe and triumph. Visually, the black and white illustrations are refreshing. Plus, Kitten is just really cute! It's a great story we will continue to read for years to come 
 Joel has written four novels from his political and theological experience which are superb. I have read the "Last Jihad", the "Last Days", the "Eziekel Option", and the "Copper Scroll" and would highly recommend them for entertainment or to understand the current problems in the Middle East. He bases his work on 1000's of years old prophecies found in the book of Ezekiel in the Bible. The books reveal how it could unfold and come true. His writings have helped me understand Ezekiel better. Joel's style of writing could be comapred to a cross of Tom Clancy and Tim LaHaye. 
 After being loaned this book for summer reading, I went back and bought my own copy. The story isn't quite what I expected, but I found I couldn't but it down.   The summary for the book is simple. Veterinarian Frannie crosses paths with a young girl named Max. But Max isn't any ordinary little girl. She has wings. And she can fly. And she's on the run, and you know that Frannie is going to end up getting involved.  This novel will answer the how and why that most readers will have. While I think at times events that take place are a little far-fetched or unrealistic, the events that happen will keep you sucked in, and you'll want to know more and more as you read. There's a certain science-fiction element through such ideas as genetic-engineering.   Anything told through Frannie's point of view, is at least to my memory, told in first person. Anything through Max, Kit's, or any other character's point of view is third person limited. This point of view I think works well for the type of story being told. First person makes things awkward.   You'll find yourself wanting to read more and more about Max and where she comes from, and the people around her. I can't say much without spoiling it, but Max and her friends are my favorite characters.  Yet at certain times, I felt a little overwhelmed by the underlying, you know it's going to happen, romance between Kit and Frannie. I don't know how such committed and powerful relationships develop in dire circumstances, but you can bet they always do.   There's lots of drama and action, so you certainly won't get bored reading this book. It will also have you thinking. Overall, it's definately a good read. 
 Amy Tan is a wonderful writer. She gives a lot of information and her characters are very human 
 This book is a definite winner. I got what the title said I would get and I am pleased with this book 
 I bought this as a gift for someone who wants to learn Indian cooking.  He loves it - it makes this style of cooking very accesible 
 Black comedy at it's best.  This film is so brilliant in the way it doesn't sit there and glorify suicide, it just makes fun of what all other movies were doing and the way the media was making  it the top story really no matter what. I like that idea.  Sometimes I write a review just to make fun of somebody elses.  You haev to have that type a sense of humor to really like this film.  When Christian Slater shows up for his first scene of the movie doing his jack nicholson impression voth in vioce and in character and pulls out a gun to shoot the second  and third person that he conversates with was a pretty surreal moment.  Of course we find out that the gun was empty and your heart may slow down a tad.  So we  continue and find out who these Heathers are.  You will figure it out pretty quick, it is just like any other teen movie but manages to give that extra sense of style for the time.  And the director does a great job of showing the girls seeming 30 years old  when they are really like 16, but then acting their age around any older person that they have to interact with like college students. Don't expect anything real, but more what of these types of people would have been like back in high school if they could achieve that kind of power.  Or sadly enough, what probably happened in many schools.    But the acting, direction and overall cheesy type of fun just ends up xploding into a great movie.   The music will certainly help you through a lot of weird scenes.    Picture quality is aesome.     The commentary is really good with explaing literally everything that happens.  All that you want to know will be answered for sure.    The documentary does a wonderful job of explaining how the movie was put together, making of, and a great job explaining what exactly it is about.  Also you realize all the greatly talented people who worked with other major direcors/producers amd things all on their own.  Also the cast gives  you more than your fill of info.    And if you can make it through the 100 paegs of notes to read the real ending, it is very trippy and gives you some insight of how they original wrote it.  Not just a black comedy but one of the most twisted films ever.  But funny.  The writer is certainly, what is the word, well , I will go with  prolific, he can write for probaably 48 hours straight or so I would imagine.  So easily a 5/5 for the dvd realease.  And a great movie.   
 Most books that deal with metaphysics or consciousness are written by people who like to tell others what they have found.  We get an individual interpretation magnified and glorified.  There seems to be quite a market  for such books, which I suppose must mean there is a taste for them.  Tales  of the Dervishes, a book which contains Teaching Stories from Sufi Masters,  is very short on interpretation of Reality, or descriptions of Reality, or  categorizations of Reality, and very long on the means to develope one's  own perception and understanding.  In these pages we find animals and  Kings, beggars and fools, a princess, the water of life and many other  familar characters and subjects.  Watching themes develope and characters  interact is like watching a map of human experience slowly develop.  What  emerges is that you have just been shown yourself 
 A moving, poetic, and inspiring work on the art, profession, and calling of teaching. "I am a teacher at heart, and there are moments in the classroom when I can hardly hold the joy" (p. 1). Palmer builds a theoretical framework of teaching based on integrity, authenticity, humility, community, hope, and love. Offers great hope to those temporarily mired in the minutia of teaching, as well as a frighteningly stark contrast for those not truly called to teach. Leaves little room for lukewarmness or doubt 
 The pages of this book are filled with the good things of life. Memories. Not only those of the author, but also for the reader as well. To someone familiar with the titles by James Herriot, reading through this book is almost like reminiscing with an old friend. Spending time collectively on an open hillside overlooking a Yorkshire dale. Surrounded by the scent of heather, farmland, natural beauty and wild vistas. Wonderful escape. I've always been charmed by Herriot's stories and his writing.  As Herriot describes the places where he lived, practiced, and holidayed in Yorkshire he is equally as charming and sentimental. I couldn't even begin to highlight what is featured in this book. A range of geography, ancient ruins, villages and towns are mentioned. With just enough history and folklore. Also included is a basic map.   Affectionately and exquisitely written. Impressively and lavishly photographed. You couldn't have a more personal, romantic account or tour outside of the real thing. Special and captivating. A treat to James Herriot fans. Recommendable book for outdoor reading too 
 Interestingly, Einstein wrote the most lucid and easy to understand explanation of relativity theory.  It is concise and it hits the mark!  I don't know of any better explanation of relativity theory than by the man who created it.  This is a masterpiece 
 Black Hearts in Battersea is a great mystery. Simon, the main character goes to Battersea to study art, but his freind isn't there where he told him he'd be. Instead, there's a strange family that tells him that they never heard of his friend. Soon it turns into a plot against the king....and I can't tell you the rest! Just read this book, and you'll enjoy it 
 If you don't own any of the other albums you might as well dive for this obligatory Greatest Hits.  I would recommend getting the Mexican or any other import release though as it includes the Spanish versions of some of the songs and a bonus dvd which includes all of the cheesy but creative music videos.  Make sure it's the NTSC version though or else you'll have some compatibility problems if you don't have a PAL player 
 The books I got were in a very good condition and really cheap. I am a student and when I asked in my University's Bookstore for the price, they asked me the triple amount of money that I paid when I bought the book through Amazon.  The only problem that really upseted me was that it arrived later than I thought it would. Thank you. 
 I like this film version of Julius Caesar. Metaphorically speaking, Caesar's contemporaries stabbed him in the back while literally stabbing him to death. The assassins' disdain was over Caesar's intentions to introduce radical change to the seat of Roman law. However, the assassins took matters into their own hands and circumvented conventional Roman law. What I like best about this film is Joseph Ruttenberg's cinematography, Miklós Rósza's score, the intelligent and captivating flow of William Shakespeare's dialogue and Brando's convincing performance as Marc Antony juxtaposed against James Mason's conundrum of an intelligent but emotional  Brutus. Of coarse this is all made possible by producer John Houseman under the direction of Joseph L. Mankiewicz. This is an incredibly enthralling production and seems to have fallen by the wayside in terms of its cinematic importance. This film seems to have suffered the same fate as Julius Caesar, stabbed in the back by time and remembered in name only. This DVD remedies that fate of posterity.  
 A must for anyone traveling in a RV.  AAA does not have a book as comprehensive as Woodall's.  Every campground in North America is in here.  The only drawback is its size...large and heavy.  Over a thousand pages can be unwielding, but great as a reference 
 very interesting book... I found it to be very detailed it doesnt just give facts it breaks everything down for you... It is a book that has answered alot of questions for me. 
 ...applicable health book I have read. Rob Faigin's physique speaks for itself. To clear up the point about beef and insulin mentioned by one of the reviewers: Rob Faigin makes it very clear that protein foods like beef also stimulate glucagon, a hormone antagonistic to insulin. As long as one reads the book thoroughly and doesn't overlook crucial points, Natural Hormonal Enhancement will clear up a whole lot of points that have been widely misunderstood.  For lack of superlatives original enough to sound convincing I'll say it straight and simple: Don't miss out on this book! Natural Hormonal Enhancement marks the beginning of the hormonal revolution that is changing our understanding of health and metabolism forever 
 sure fire britpop at it's finest Jarvis Cocker is a smart and witty frontman you can't go wrong with this............. 
 One of the issues I had with the book is that it has multiple personalities, in multiple ways. First, having multiple authors colaborate means that different chapters sometimes have a completely different tone and feel than other chapters. So, you might "click" with one of the authors, but find it difficult to follow a different author's chapter.   The other way that the book has multiple personalities is that it seems to try to provide 3 distinct different types of information in the same book. Part of it is reverse-engineering and shell-coding, part of it is programming secure code and part of it is the concepts of hacking and the tools and techniques used.   That has both pros and cons. In some ways it lacks what may be found in books more focused on just one of those topics such as Exploiting Software or Hacking Exposed. But for those looking for breadth of information, this book provides a lot of content in one place.   Issues aside, I thought the information was excellent and I recommend that security administrators and programmers take a look at this book.   (... 
 Hilary Mantel has written a small, delightful little book in the novel, Fludd.  The title character, Fludd, arrives in the village of Fetherhoughton and , both subtly and drastically, changes things at a crucial time for the local priest, Father Angwin, and the Catholic Church.  This is background for a wonderfully eccentric group of characters that charm their way through the book.  I initially picked up the book because of an interest in the historical Robert Fludd, the alchemist, but discovered that it was the quirky denizens of this village that captured my heart and were the driving force behind the book 
 I started this book knowing very little about the main characters. I never heard of Michael Milken or Ivan Boesky until I read this. It was interesting and entertaining to understand what they achieved and what they threw away. This is greed at its best. Some of the most intelligent and successful people in wall street who couldn't handle the success they already attained. I also enjoyed how the author made some of these people look like complete fools. The ones who couldn't succeed on their own so they had to cheat the system to look powerful. Then the ones who could succeed on their own but let their self-indulgence get the best of them. Once you finish this book you will realize these people were the biggest players in the market throughout the 80's. 
 i really enjoyed the infomative and eye opening information and descriptions in this book. Most useful. i used to be a total dummy when it came to these things *blush* but i have to say since seeing Roger Greene and The Guru on Tv and the radio, and reading their best seeling books The Art of Seduction and How To Get Any Girl Any Time, i found that i my sex life increased dramatically, a new lease on life you could say, but then i found my self a little commonplace and hackneyed in the bedroom and this book gave me and my sex life the spice i was lookg for. Great stuff 
 The DK guide books are becoming a necesity for us on our travels. The pictures give you an idea of what you'll see, but what's helpful, is that based on what you read, you can narrow down what is on your priority list. Because honestly, unless you're going to be in a place for over a month, you can't see everything 
 Considered better than RW's.....1000 rewrites. Panasonic recorders are highly rated along with their Plasmas. I have a Panasonic EH80 (workhorse) 80g Hard Drive and I like these ie.my Hard Drive is full (meaning it's time to erase) For the budget minded this is the way to go.  Not every recorder uses DVD-RAM. Well priced at Amazon. Check out the good deals on Panasonic recorders 
 I think this is the cutest Thomas Bedding print. The only one complaint that I have about this set is that it's very rough. I purchased the comforter and twin sheet set. I only washed the sheets and they still seem rough. They do not fit that well on a thick mattress but they are doing fine on my son's bed. I would recommend this set because it's so cute 
 This album gets 5 stars not because its creator smashed guitars, but because it a work of pure genius. About twenty years ahead of its time, Tommy not only pushed the envelope thematically with its complexity but succeeded musically. Maybe to some viewers it sounds easy to weave together brilliant and inspired story with highest-caliber rock music but this is an inspired and brilliant work that stands alone among rock music works. If the rule of thumb in judging any work of art is how long it will last, Tommy wins hands down--I predict a hundred years of enthusiastic listerning, at least 
 I agree that it took me a couple of chapters to really get into it, but after that I was hooked!  The main character went into the prayer conference/group dragging her feet, but ended up being the one that needed it the most.  I love the vulnerability of this character - she seemed real and honest to me.  I initially bought this for an online group book club, but ended up being the only one that followed thru, so I read it at my own pace and couldn't put it down!  I have ADD, and to finish a book for me is incredible, ha ha.  So I celebrated when I finished this one... left me wanting more.  I'm on my way to get the next one now 
 I would have given this 5 stars except that I didn't like the ending. It just wasn't as creative as Kellerman's thrillers usually are.  In this fine book, Kellerman explores an illness called Munchausen by proxy, where parents injure their children to get attention. This child is close to dying from whatever is going on. Either it's Munchausen, could one of her parents or other caretakers be poisoning 21-month-old Cassie on purpose? Or Cassie has an illness the docs can't identify. Alex finds evidence of what he thinks proves one situation to be the culprit -- and a person to be the culprit. But by the end of the case, he learns all is not what it seems -- even evidence. Alex must hurry his own investigation before the toddler dies!  I highly recommend this book, even tho I think the ending could have been more exciting. Many kudos to Kellerman for coming up with such bizarre storylines 
 If you are into politics and drama of the cerebral kind, then this is for you. In my mind this is one of the best to date. Great acting and a clintonesque president (minus the scandals) make for great TV 
 I had to read several stories from this book for school, and the ones which I read were innovative and entertaining.  Originally published in the 50's, this anthology of classic short stories is definatley worth the money 
 The book is called Simple Pleasures not Simple Cooking !!  If you want to set your tastebuds alight, then go through some of the recipes in this book.  Sure it isn't a book of simplistic recipes, of how to make your evening meal in 30 minutes or less, but that isn't what you buy this book for.  If you want a book that shows you the recipes and thinking of one of the best modern American chefs, then you buy this book.  Having gone through the book, I think that this will be one of the cookbooks that I will use the most.   On a par with Bistro Cooking at Home by Gordon Hamersley, and Cooking One on One by John Ash.  Some of the best of modern American cooking is contained in these pages 
 I picked the paperback version of this book up on a whim about a month ago, and am I ever glad that I did.  I've never been a big reader of celebrity biographies or autobiographies, having read only those of Ingrid Bergman (autobiography) and Vivien Leigh (three different biographies), and then Jane Fonda's memoir.  "Never Have Your Dog Stuffed" is a much shorter book than any of those books, but I didn't feel I was getting significantly less of anything from its author.    I've always been a fan and admirer of Alan Alda, but hadn't really paid him much attention over the past several years.  That changed when he started his stint on "The West Wing" where I thought he was marvelous.  The Emmy he won this past August for his portrayal of Arnold Vinick was well deserved.  In a way I used to find Mr. Alda, going back to when he first came to fame on MASH,  to be much like the character of Vinick, that is to say, almost too good to be true.  Sure, I was a fan and all, and enjoyed reading what a great guy he was in all the interviews given during that time, but I still kept thinking that there had to be someting about the man that would eventually come to light that would make him seem a little more real.  Well, this book is it.  However, most of what was disclosed all those years ago, holds.  There is no scandal to humanize the man, only a life story that I'm so glad he decided to tell.  From childhood his lifestyle alternated between hand-to-mouth and privilege.  And when he started his professional career, even though he was the son of a well-known actor, he most definitely paid his dues.  And during this time he was still keeping a close eye on his schizophrenic mother, and was married with children.  Much has been said in other reviews here about his mother.  I didn't know a thing about her until reading this book, and her story is a sad one.  However, I was just as affected by the story of his relationship with his father, of whom he says in one of the picture captions: "I adored him."  It was the two of them against the world and his mother for many years, and through ups and downs, but mostly ups, and I was quite touched by the details provided here.  The paperback version has a lovely afterword that was not in the hardback, that brings his father, long gone at this point, back into the story one more time.  If the book is wanting at all, it probably is in Mr. Alda's recounting of the roles he has played.  A chapter is devoted to MASH, and actually, that was enough for me.  I've read a lot about MASH in the past, but I wouldn't have minded hearing more about some of his movie and theatrical roles.  The play "Art," for instance, is not mentioned.  I know a few people who saw him in that and loved him in his role.  But this is a minor quibble.  This is the autobiography of a person who happens to be a celebrity, and it is entertaining, affecting, heartrending at times, and always suffused with humor.  It's a terrific read 
 My son got this book from grandma when he was a little over a year old.  It was an automatic favorite!  It starts with "Oh the wonderful sounds Mr. Brown can do.  He can sound like a cow.  He can go moo moo."  It has pictures that are engaging for their simplicity and a rhyme that is flowing but varied so it doen't get boring.  My son loved learning the noises and now he says them along with me when I read.  I've even caught him looking at this book and saying the noises to himself.  He's now 2 and we still read this one often (and I have it memorized).  I highly recommend this book.  I just don't know how you couldn't like it!  
 I would recommend this to anyone who wants to better themselves in the region of art history knowledge and the ability to evaluate art's content as well.  It was well worth buying and compliments any classes orientated towards the subject...maybe would even overshadow the required text 
 When Alice parted ways with his original band and struck out on his own, he started with the brilliant "Welcome to my Nightmare," and then the nearly as brilliant "Goes to Hell," largely on the strength of the fantastic band he had backing him.  Ever since then, his output has rarely had the continuous kind of spark of dark genius he'd had. Nevertheless, from time to time, he kicks out an album that is flat-out jaw-dropping. "Brutal Planet" is one such, and "Dada" is another.  There is quite literally nothing else like this in all of Alice's output, and considering that it was released the same year as "Zipper Catches Skin," perhaps his most novelty-like album, one can hardly begin to guess from what part of his lower psyche this grand galleon of an album became unmoored and sailed into public view. Doubtless, it has something to do with Bob Ezrin, and the return of Dick Wagner on guitar (who'd been instrumental on "Welcome to my Nightmare" and "Goes to Hell").  Whether or not the disc comprises a concept album as a whole, the first three songs are certainly interrelated.  "Dada," the opener (written by Ezrin), is a genuinely creepy, even moving and strange combination of heavy percussive accents, keyboards, grand tubular bells, a girl's voice repeating "dada" throughout, and a mumbled, half-comprehensible conversation between a psychiatric patient and his therapist. The patient's monologue, to say nothing of the way it is layered, echoed, and delivered, is a masterpiece of schizophrenic ramble. There's one line, "I have a son," that trebles with almost a catch of sadness in the father's voice that makes the last line, "Where's my boy?" almost painful to listen to. In the context of the first three songs, this is a portrait of the father, who is blisteringly criticized in the next piece.  "Enough's Enough," is much more straightforward, and describes a somewhat gothic tale of a mother's death, and the evil father, who now has his son totally in his power. Nevertheless, for the first time in his catalogue, Alice seems to be attacking the figure of his own father, the one who punches him in the nose in "No More Mr. Nice Guy."  Again, to Alice's credit, as in the opening song, the characterization of the father seems to be allowed space to be itself. Here the father is sarcastic and cruel, instead of crazy, and Alice declares, "I just want to tell you, you're a lousy Dad, to hell with you. Enough's enough, enough's enough," as if finally exorcising that ghost.  The song also has the enigmatic line, "Hey Dad, why'd you hide your brother." It seems like the next song answers this question.  "Former Lee Warmer" bears some resemblance to Cooper's other epic, the "Steven" cycle. In this particular case, it tells the story of someone who has been locked away upstairs since forever. "All the mops and brooms keep him company / Misconceived of the family." This might be the father's hidden brother. Narrative matters aside, this is a particularly lush and handsome piece musically, full of details (notice the locked-up brother's moans almost lost in the mix), touches, and brilliant arrangement.  If there is any one song that shows how genuinely Cooper owns a particular musical terrain where Gothic sensibility is utterly at home, this is it.  It's hard to imagine anyone but Alice being able to pull off, much less, write a song like this. Gorgeous.  The next three songs also seem to form something of a trilogy as well, as the main character throughout seems to be engaging in various confusing attempts at love affairs. In "No Man's Land" in particular Alice ventures into territory not normally explored by him--a kind of boy meets girl, uptempo ballad (where both characters are actually alive).  The song particularly shows what Alice's most previous three album's could've been like with better attention to production, since it is largely just a straightforward rocker--at least until the multiple personality disorder of the narrator comes out. A very solid song.  "Dyslexia" starts off with a keyboard driven riff of all things, with some fat acoustic accents. Again, while theoretically something like the kind of novelty song one might find on "Flush the Fashion," the lushness of the production, the many canny details, turn it into something far grander.  One almost fails to notice that the song is about yet another mental condition--though one far less severe than in the previous four songs.  "Scarlet and Sheba" is a genuinely epic and gorgeous piece about vampires, that starts off with a really handsome, eastern-influenced passage. The particular combination here of sex kitten sensibility, vampirism, love song, and thick lush instrumentation is very satisfying--the eastern-influenced passages even more so.  The guitar solo, as one expects from Dick Wagner, is also especially fine.  The song leads immediately into "I Love America," which is Alice's left-handed send up of 80s male shtick--although to be fair, the whole thing is delivered with so much enthusiasm and almost kooky charm ("I'm graj-ee-ated but I ain't to bright" "I got a job but hell I'm still in debt") that it's hard not to buy it at face-value.  Like the even-handed characterization of the father in "Dada," the character is given enough rope to hang himself.  "Fresh Blood" is the second vampire song on the album, although the main character may be finding victims for a "he" or hunting for himself.  Could this be one of the main character's four personalities? Is this the same guy who was hanging out with Scarlet and Sheba? One can't tell for certain, but the tantalizing suggestion of this is one of the things that makes the album seem to knit together so effectively.  The music here, as well, is heavy ("lugubrious" is the word I really want to use), infectious, and gets into your blood (no pun intended).  "Pass the Gun Around" as the final song on the album is not only another of Alice's suicide narrations, but it also serves as a kind of finale to the overall narrative that may or may not be running through the album.  In this respect, it is a particularly grim end--as a response to the family trauma of the opening songs that scar the main character and apparently thwart his search love in some of the rest of the songs. It also serves as a final condemnation of the lousy, insane father from the opening. But these thematic issues aside, the music here is especially committed and strong--the guitar solo is achingly powerful (David Gilmour would've been proud of it if he'd played it), and Alice's singing is more heart-felt than perhaps he's ever been, or at least since "I Never Wrote Those Songs."  Undoubtedly one of the greatest songs Alice has ever committed to disc, this certainly warrants buying the disc itself.  And, of course, during the fade out, the sudden and startling gunshot is the same drum accent that opened the album, followed, of course, by one last "dada".  As a wholly unexpected thing, this album was an astonishment at the time that it came out, despite its miserable sales. But even today, it is still a powerful, varied, and altogether wholly satisfying disc.  While nothing like the original Alice Cooper band's output, and nothing like the knowing winks of his more recent stuff, this bravely straightforward, as-close-to-unironic-as-Cooper-ever-gets disc shows just how much genuine narrative power and effect he is capable of generating--all wrapped up in magnificently composed, arranged and performed music. An absolute must-have from Cooper's output--just don't expect it to be like anything else he's done. 
 In the wake of the tragic events in New York. Many americans were confused about thier muslim nieghbors. Many seek answers of the events explained by extreme views that islam is a violent religion that threatens america. For years i seen politicians, journalists, and evangalists try to show islam to be a religion threatening to americans for there own personal gains. In this book, it reveals from sound islamic scholarship that islam is not a relgion for extremists or warmongers. It gives the approach from legitamate scholarship that was reconized by the majority of muslim scholars all throughout the history of islam. The books shows in a good manner to average westerners and confused muslims how reformists who broke away from the fold of the majority try to make up there own ways of religion for political and personel gain. Basically heretics. It gives how they rose and the ideas that gave roots to them. For a person trying to find truth in this crazy situation that we americans find ourselves i think you would find it very enlightening. But if you want to beleive in Robert Spencer's, Daniel Pipe's, Hal Lindsey's, Ibn Warraq's, and Bin Ladin's interpetation of islam then this book isnt for you. This view point comes from a muslim convert who study indepthly of this religion for many years and conversed with many of the great muslim scholars on many issues. I am also a patriotic american who served in Operation Iraqi freedom in the war against Terrorism to help keep America safe. This book from my studies is what i feel helps keep america safe 
 It took us to places that the locals thought were not available without local knowledge. I highly recommend this book.  Please e-mail me with your comment 
 Royko's classic portrait of Daley and "his" Chicago is perhaps most distinguished by its narrator.  While the facts remain the same between this book and others such as American Pharoah, the profound attachment and understanding of a man who spent his professional career writing about the same city that shaped Daley creates a much more colorful and intricate perspective on mid 20th century Chicago.  Presented as a journalistic piece rather than a heavily footnoted history or political science text, Boss engages the reader on a more narrative than statistical level.  Through personal stories of machine "grunts" and smoke filled rooms, Royko accomplishes more in just over 200 pages than the statistical tome American Pharoah does in over 600.  It comes down to one necessary and incontrovertable fact:  only a Chicagoan can truly understand and synthesize the experience and leadership of his or her city.  East-coasters can write about the "City with Big Shoulders" until their knuckles seize up, but they will not be able to truly appreciate the subtleties of Chicago's culture and psyche.   As a highly respected voice in Chicago journalism who was at loggerheads with Mayor Daley on numerous occasions, Royko presents an honest and faithful version of Chicago and its mayor.        
 This is a nice book, not only about caesarian period. If you're interested in legions you MUST buy it 
 Blood Enemy is a gripping, Tristan and Isolde-like story about Lucian (a werewolf slave of the vampires) and Sonja (vampire and daughter of vampire elder Viktor). Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down, though I was a bit disappointed to discover that Selene doesn't make much of an appearance in this story. The only problem is that this story was obviously written before Underworld: Evolution, and as a result a number of things didn't add up. Marcus makes an appearance, and his character doesn't agree with that of Evolution, among other things. But, keeping in mind that the author was not privy to details of the future movie, it's a great story - I highly recommend it to all Underworld fans 
 Ramsey Campbell is a bit of an aquired taste. This most literate of horror writers is not out to race your pulse or gross you out. Thrill seekers should search elsewhere. But for those of you able to settle into moody, carefully crafted prose, the subtle delights set him apart from his run-and-gun contemporaries. If most horror fiction is beer to be guzzled, this is cognac to be savored.  Ramsey Campbell has obviously had some experience with psychedelics. Any knowledge you may have in this realm will add to the verisimilitude. If you've read H.P. Lovecraft, M.R. James, and/or Robert Aikman you can better appreciate the literary traditions Campbell draws upon.  I have little to add to the story descriptions ably discussed in other reviews. One additional warning, the paperback version is printed in the smallest type I've ever seen (or not seen). Unless you have excellent vision, buy a new or used hardback copy. And sip s-l-o-w-l-y 
 This book (and the movie which derives from it) is remarkable, all the moreso because of the the amount of inadvertent prophecy that takes place during the course of it. 'Shoes of the Fisherman' is a phrase that is sometimes used to refer to the office of the Pope, the Bishop of Rome; the See of Peter, the Chair of Peter, etc., various other historical and scriptural references are a kind of ecclesial shorthand.   This story takes place during the height of the Cold War, when it was not primarily a two-way confrontation, but rather seemed to threaten to become a three-way contest with the seeming emergence of China as a communist power independent from the Soviet Union.  This book sets a looming crisis between the United States and Soviet Union as the primary issue, and concludes with a major conference for peace being called (we do not get to know the outcome of this, however, from the book).    Archbishop Kiril Lakato, longtime political prisoner of the Soviet Union, is released (the exact reasoning for this we are never told) by his long-time captors. He is released to Rome, where he is installed as a cardinal for his faithfulness to the church. In quick succession after this, the pope dies, and an election takes place. Remarkably, Kiril the Russian is elected pope, after giving a moving account of his time in captivity to assembled cardinals weary of the election process, and shortly thereafter commits the church to a risky idea of intervention between the major powers, to the dismay of many of the fellow cardinals, who believe the new pope is following a dangerous path.  Subplots include a very timid (by today's standards), and to a certain extent a bit distracting.  The main issue (rather than the plot) is to explore the theological issues behind the papal election and the use of theology and politics in the modern church.  Despite being written in the 1960s, the book in fact still rings true with many of the facets of this slow-to-change institution.  What makes this book and its attendant film so remarkable is that it was released a full decade before the election of another pope from the communist block. In the 1960s it was considered very shocking to consider a non-Italian pope, much less one coming from behind the Iron Curtain. This of course had the prophetic ring when Karol (not Kiril) from Poland became pope.  Another prophetic instance is in the ecclesiastical trial of the radical theologian -- during his defense, this theologian even uses the words that later theologians would use, who were silenced by the Roman order, and who finally had to leave the church to remain true to their convictions in some instances. Just how the author could have foreseen these so far in advance is a mystery.   
 Okay, this album rocks, and is my second-favorite of Santana's albums, behind the mighty Abraxas. But some of it kinda sucks, which is why I only give four stars, rather than five. First the good news: No One to Depend On is a masterpiece. You know, take a bit of metal, a bit of blues, a bit of Latin, even a bit of the whacky psychedelia from the first album. Add the organ groove and Santana's signature guitar soloing away. What could be better, you ask? That bit in the bridge where they switch between English and Spanish. ("I ain't GOT no one - tengo anadie... that I can de-PEND on - tengo anadie..." is that not supremely cool?) This ain't a one-song album, though. I mean, how can a Santana fan NOT love the dramatic near-instrumental Touissant L'Overture? Santana's Santana on that song (it goes without saying he can outplay pretty much everyone), and there's those nonstop riffs he trades with Neil Schon and the polyrhythmic attack... yeah. Of course, Santana hasn't abandoned salsa, so if you liked Oye Como Va, you'll probably love Guajira. That sax solo's a nice touch, too. Jungle Strut is fusion mania, but in a good way. There's also Everybody's Everything, easily the funkiest thing Santana ever did, with a huge horn section - it's fun and catchy indeed, and Schon's wah-wah is killer, but the lyrics arie the usual pseudo-spiritual mumbo-jumbo that made up most of Santana's lyrics at that point. But come on, do you listen to Santana because you want to hear him babble about how the King and Queen of Soul are gonna come around or whatever the hell it is he's going on about this time? No. You listen to him because he's an unbeatable guitarist, plain and simple. Everything's Coming Our Way was a hit too, but I could've done without it - more of those dumb lyrics, and it sounds like Santana's doing The Byrds... nothing wrong with The Byrds, but it sounds out-of-place from Santana. The instrumentals Batuka, Taboo and Para Los Rumberos only confirm this one's status as #2. But the best of this is as good as (if not better than) the Abraxas classics, so you can't go wrong with this. 
 Fred Anderson's "The Crucible of War" is an absolutely fantastic book about the French and Indian War.  Make sure to read the short preface.  In it Anderson describes a scene in which colonel George Washington's scouting party is ambushed by Indians, and just as Washington's group is about to head back, an Indian chief swings a tommahawk into the skull of a injured fighter, literally spilling out brains, in which the Indian chief washes his hands.  Thus colonel George Washington helped start a world-wide conflict called the Seven Years War, Anderson explains.  It doesn't get any more gripping than that.  I was immediately shocked upon reading such a gory opening statement, and I couldn't put the book down afterwards.  Despite the fact that it is loaded with factual material and a slower read, the read itself is fascinating.  Don't let the fact that the book spends the first 500 pages going through, step by step, the battles that comprised this conflict scare you off.  Anderson seems to weave into each small chapter a deeper meaning or tell how each battle fit into the larger scheme of things.    He makes a fascinating study of the way battles were conducted in the day.  And attached to the battles as the conflict goes on, is a running commentary of the larger picture of what was going on in the colonies, Britain, France, and the rest of Europe.  The factual information and research are top rate, and the writing is tops, too.  The war itself was definitely part of a larger conflict going on in Europe, and, once again, Anderson concisely and poignantly explains this aspect.  For instance, Britain decided that the best way to battle the French in Europe, decrease the pressure on their own shores, to attack the French's weakest side, was to go after the French empire outside of Europe.  In this manner, the North American French and Indian War was part of the greater European conflict.  This is precisely the problem Thomas Paine was writing about and a major reason he argued in favor of severing the colonies from the British Empire.  I'm a little more ambivalent about commenting on the last 250 pages, which are totally different.  After 500 pages of military and political/military information, he goes into the aftereffects of the war in the colonies and the British Empire, particularly, he describes the severe financial strain the War cause the British and how they dealt with it-mainly they tried to extract money from the colonies-thus, the Stamp Act and other controversies which lead to our War of Independence.  I enjoyed the second part, but it could easily have been a second book, the content and character of the subject matter was so different.  In the front of the book, Anderson has about 8 perfectly detailed maps of the colonies and Canada and period maps of Europe.  For the battles that took place here, I constantly referred back to these maps.  Following the action geographically on a map helped tremendously.  Anderson's description of who the Indians were and the war from their viewpoint was also fascinating.  They seemed to be much more complex than I expected.    Lastly, a prior commentator mentions that Anderson neglects the French side of the War.  The French always seem to be the bad boys, never the innocent victims.  I wondered about this as I read.  He may have a point 
 It is clear from the carefully composed prose on every page that Wong loves this game.  As an Englishman introduced to baseball by sport channels, Ken Burns and books, I learned that the national pastime was and is America's true love: a game that grew with the country.  Wong doesn't simply write about the memorabilia but makes the effort to explore the intimate relationship between Americans and the game.  Articulate, thoughtful and passionate, the book is very engaging and yet I am left wondering why Wong didn't spend his time concentrating on the real thing: cricket.    
 "The Player" could be considered Altman's "Big Lebowski" in that it withholds much of its pleasure from the first viewing and then begins to grow on you after you have seen it a couple times. This is because it is basically a huge inside joke on mainstream Hollywood film-making, with too many obscure references for a Hollywood outsider to effectively process the first time around.   Also like "The Big Lebowski,  the satire and sardonic wit is packaged around what appears to be a crime drama, with the straight drama itself engaging enough to entertain most viewers the first time around.   Tim Robbins plays Griffin Mill, a high level studio executive whose job is listening to the countless pitches that come his way from aspiring writers wanting to get their screen play into production. The studio only produces a dozen features a year so Griffin mostly hands out rejections. He has made at least one major enemy during the process, an unknown writer who begins sending him threatening postcards.   Griffin thinks he has a line on the identity of his enemy, an unpublished writer named David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio-Private Pyle in "Full Metal Jacket) who lives in the valley with his artist girlfriend (Greta Scacchi). But their confrontation goes bad and Griffin accidentally kills him. Things get worse for Griffin; he becomes the main suspect for the murder, he gets a post-murder postcard revealing that he murdered the wrong guy, and he is in danger of being replaced by a newly hired hotshot Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher).   "The Player" is most famous for an eight-minute tracking shot at the very beginning of the film, self-reflexively compared to Hitchcock's "Rope" and to Welles' "Touch of Evil"; and full of Altman's trademark overlapping dialogue. Also notable are the 50 or so actors who make cameo appearances throughout the feature; most just play themselves (it is after all set in Hollywood) and it is entertaining just trying to identify everyone.   The DVD has a commentary by Altman and writer Michael Tolkin. Unfortunately Altman's film-making style does not lend itself to organized reflection so he mostly just rambles on about everything but the film; and Tolkin has major issues with the whole Hollywood scene so his commentary is just a continuous rant and whine about the system.   It is important to remember that Altman is essentially a Hollywood black sheep who has been at war with Hollywood his whole career. The Hollywood establishment is uncomfortable with him because he won't make their standard pre-sold product and yet he manages to crank out enough commercial successes on his own terms to keep them off balance.   "The Player" is kind of his revenge picture, he knew that its production would cause a wave of paranoia to sweep the industry and he made paranoia the defining characteristic of the film. He views Hollywood as a marketing machine that both drives and is driven by the lowest common denominator of audience demographics.  During the opening tracking shot look for Griffin's meeting with Buck Henry, who pitches a sequel to "The Graduate" (Elaine and Benjamin have a daughter and he suggests "The Postgraduate" for the sequel's title). Henry improvised this pitch which is funnier with each viewing, and appropriately also had a cameo in "The Graduate".  These film allusions are everywhere as Hollywood's past seems to be passing judgment on its pathetic present. Watch for the bungled meeting at the hotel, the scene ends with the camera centered on a picture of Hitchcock on the hotel wall-a shot of about the same duration as a typical Hitchcock cameo (in his own films).  For sheer comedy watch for Griffin's visit to police headquarters where the Pasadena detective (Whoopi Goldberg), interviews him in the busy squad room. Another detective (Lyle Lovett) is a movie buff who keeps chanting "One of us! One of us!" from "Freaks".   Griffin plots to derail the threat inside the studio by setting up Levy with a script pitched by self-styled auteur Tom Oakley (Richard E. Grant). It's a Susan Hayward vehicle with the heroine going to the gas chamber because "it's reality, and that's what happens." Oakley wants real which means no stars and a non-Hollywood ending. Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis are mentioned as exactly type of casting Oakley does not want; which foreshadows his pending commercial corruption and artistic compromise.  This is a film that is meant to be watched closely (the beginning tracking shot is Altman's way of getting our attention and warning us that we will need to pay attention). Audience involvement is very important to him and he is counting on a motivated audience who brings considerable prior knowledge to the viewing.  Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child

 I wasn't sure where Chesapeake Bay was when I started this book. I knew it was somewhere on the east coast but didn't realize it was so geographically big. I also didn't realize so many of the big cities that I've heard of is located on or near the Chesapeake Bay. So for me this made the book quite interesting. Once again with Micheners characteristic trademark, he starts the earliest Indians. It was interesting to read that while some Indians were violent some were passive. This makes sense; it would be really hard to generalize about such a big population. Some may find the beginning of Micheners epics slow; certainly this book is no exception. But what I really like is how the last third of the book will some how reference an event or character from the previous part. The pirate aspect of the Chesapeake is interesting; but what captivates is the civil war and the statues of African Americans. We tend to forget at one time that even good people had misconceptions. Much like the Afrikaners in Micheners "The Covenant," I liked these hard working white people; I just didn't like their attitude or treatments of Blacks. The introduction of the Quakers was a bonus for me , as I am unfamiliar with there practices and beliefs. It was also an ironic twist that Michener included a Watergate plot near the end this really brought it into the modern times. So from the earliest Indians to Watergate this book should not fail to interest every reader 
 Again we find Frank at his best,wether happy or sad songs,every project is tackled with the same enthusiasm.The upbeat treatment of "Be careful,it's my heart" is truly a gem.I have no hesitation in recommending this CD. The songs on this CD are commonly known as Standards,but Sinatra lifts them to a new height 
 Patti Smith could rock and be a poet, both of which she knew her craft. This anthology has the best of both and offers just about all you would need from her. I suppose die-hards will already have all of her albums, but there are some rarities on here that you won't find elsewhere. Enjoy her hard rocking and poetic themes 
 I purchased this disc through Amazon for my wife who loves this guy. I must say we both enjoyed listening to this all season long. My wife is from Mexico and is always looking for good, quality Christmas music in spanish. This exceeded her expectations 
 First, let me get all of MY negative thoughts on the diet out of the way:  it's expensive... dried apricots withOUT sulfur dioxide is pricey, and unless you live in a tropical area, the amazing enzyme-packed fruits you need to consume can slim down your wallet too. Next, it sort of gives you permission to indulge, and to me, that mindset can be dangerous, but maybe that's just a result of having strict parents & living in a puritanical society... I usually felt very guilty during the diet! :) Now to address the naysayers, you did truly not read the overall intent of Ms. Mazel. You probably have a difficult time with seeing the big picture in a lot of instances, don't you? Judy's concepts make ALOT of sense. She's practical, truthful, and it's a pity she caved and gave in to producing that Part II 'updated' version of the diet to make some people happy. She doesn't promote exercise, but she doesn't need to~ she's blessed in that department apparently. Maybe YOU do... I know *I* do... OK, so you get a little bit of the runs after the first week? if it comes to that? why not! your body is ridding itself of toxins my dear... the cleansing step is working. Your skin especially will thank you.  Also I love the fact that the Beverly Hills Diet promotes carbs, and there's NOT a lack of protein... the concept is called conscious combining Carbohydrates fuel your body! No substitutes, and like she says, you've got to approach it logically~ a Krispy Kreme donut is obviously a carb, and certainly you can have it when it's time, but where are the nutritional values? the concept of conscious combining is exactly what the body needs. Frankly, I'm just waiting for the Atkins ball to drop. There's going to be mass liver & kidney failure the likes of which we've never seen before all over the place, and soon. How can your body process so much protein~ all the time?! oh weeee'll seeeee... if Judy's smart she will capitalize on this sad yet brilliant opportunity to push BHD again 
 Look, if you're looking for a film that'll move mountains, forget it. You cannot take There Was a Crooked Man seriously. That said, if you're looking for a fun film, with a screenplay that departs just enough from the standard conventions of the Western genre to be interesting, then check this out. Think meatloaf and crinkle fries as opposed to steak and taters. The storyline is imaginative, the central characters are likeable albeit, mostly irredeemable, and the dialogue is humorous...even the awkward and slightly bad late sixties baroque pop score somehow works, even though you might cringe the first time you hear it open the film. There is enough entertainment value here to merit a DVD release. Take it easy...don't be a snob...you'll have fun with it if you allow yourself 
 As of this date I still have not finished the book, but this has been a book that has tought me how to avoid the pitfalls of running your business. It is for this wisdom that the book is a treasure, no romaticism, fire-soul inspiration, just nononsense advice on how the real world operates, given samples on how some have flopped by disobeying the principles. 
 Years ago, I picked up Harold Faulkner's "Politics, Reform and Expansion" to kill a little time. I didn't have any idea, but it was part of a group of books written decades ago and published by Harper and Row called the New American Nation Series. The books tell the story of US History in 40 odd volumes, written by prominent academia from the time. They  have been revised occasionally as the decades passed. I cant really explain why I like the set so much, but I do. I suppose there's something deep inside my heart that yearns for the New Frontier Idealism when it seemed we were much more optimistic as a people. I think that's fine for all of us if we can recognize the limitations of thinking about it in those terms....  Over the years I started picking up the series here and there. The latest for me is George Mowry's book on the Theodore Roosevelt Era.  The treatment of William Howard Taft is unkind, to say the least. Mowry paints a picture of a clueless and lazy fatdude, stuck in a bathtub of unoriginality who wrecks TR's hopes to reform big business by siding with monopolists and failing to lead his own politicalparty, which enjoyed unchallenged rule, until Taft destroyed it through inertia.  Mowry seems unsure of what to make of Theodore Roosevelt. Like other historians, he seems to admire one side of the man and ignore the other. Was TR a reckless war monger or the Nobel Prize Winner? Was he a racist who believed African-Americans were some sort of inferior race or was he the man who appointed more blacks to offices than any other post-reconstruction Presidents? Meddling internationalist who believed US power was superior or protector of Venezuela against British intrusion? Roosevelt was a complicated man, an egotist and maybe one of the great ones.  Before the politics of the book, Mowry talks about intellectual, social and religious tides that ring a little hollow to me. I do believe there are intellectual movements that have impact on what's going on in every time. How relevant are such things to the poor farmer raising his crop at the start of the 20th century? Maybe not enough for as much of the book to be devoted to the topic. We probably would have recieved more social history in another age.  I am awe struck at the racism that ran through the time. We certainly were not taught how many racist notions were in the minds of the Progressives of the time.  If you bear the time period in which it was written in context this book is a good pick-up, but the last word on scholarship didn't die with JFK .... You can find more modern things. I think Mowry's book is a good ancillary text to anything from today 
 Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone series of Alphabet mysteries has been a huge seller since its inception in 1982.  I've wanted to read the books for years but didn't for one reason or another.  I finally sat down with the first entry, "A is for Alibi," and plunged into it.  Nikki Fife is a young widow who was recently released from prison; she served eight years for killing her husband.  She insists that she's innocent and hires Kinsey to clear her name.    Kinsey's first case is interesting and filled with a number of suspects.  It's a solid mystery book.  Kinsey is a likeable protagonist, who has just enough shades of gray and quirks.  She's the kind of lead who doesn't distract too much from the mystery at hand, but she's interesting enough to carry the book.  Grafton's writing is good - straight-forward but filled with nice details.  At times, she spends perhaps a bit too much time describing Nikki and the murder suspects.  However, that's a minor quibble.  I wasn't blown away by "A is for Alibi," but it was good enough that I've already ordered the next entry, "B is for Burglar."  
 This CD is just fabulous and everyone who hears it wants a copy.  Very sophisticated yet original music, soothing and exciting sound 
 One of the best books I've ever read.  I was rooting for, and amazed by, the friendships that withstood decades of misunderstand, or was that understanding?   A beautifully written novel that gets to the core of female friendships. I would highly recommend it to all women who have been married. Do yourself a favor and read this book.  
 Good book. A solid value. This is a very versatile book, as it applies to all types of construction business. Its really about solid business practices(not strictly pertaining to building, although theres plenty about that in here). This book is very business oriented and covers quite a bit in the legal aspect as well. Good book with good templates. Finally i got some decent info on lein waivers.  To those who arent computer savvy, chapter 17 is for you 
    In Colin MacKinnon, we have a bright new star of the spy novel.  Set in the period leading up to 9/11, Morning Spy, Evening Spy tells the story of a CIA operative investigating the death of a part-time CIA contractor in Afganistan.  Is the contractor involved in drugs as well as intelligence?  Is his death arranged by a former CIA agent, a native Afgan recruited during the Russian occupation of Afganistan?  And what is the role of Al Queda, which the CIA is trying to penetrate?    MacKinnon skillfully weaves his account of the search for the killer with a description of the mounting evidence that "something large" is being planned by Al Queda.  He has the gift of knowing the territory.  His accounts of the machinations and infighting in the intelligence community ring true.  His description of the meetings and mannerisms within the CIA brings to mind Len Deighton, at his best, describing the workings of British intelligence.      Coupled with the espionage plot is a love story between the protagonist and his Washington Post reporter girlfriend.  Adicts of "action" novels may find the romantic interest interrupting the flow of the plot, but it's a reminder that spies also lead human lives.      We know, of course, what happens on 9/11, and this shadow overhangs the story.  Morning Spy, Evening Spy will provide the reader insight into the fight against terrorism and a good espionage yarn as well.  Mr. MacKinnon is a welcome entry into a field somewhat depleted with the demise of the Cold War and the unfortunate decline in powers of old favorites like LeCarre, Deighton and Forsyth.  Charles McCarry (be sure and read "Old Boys") is MacKinnon's only true rival 
 Sunny Spells and Scattered Showers is more of the same that can be found on their self-titled debut, but the band has obviously matured.  John Williams, Winifred Horan, and Seamus Egan are all in top form.  John Doyle's guitar has become more refined and he truly shines on this album, his playing transcending mere backup.  Karan Casey is a delight to hear, especially on the track "Aililiu Na Gamhna".  I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes Irish traditional music.  You won't be disappointed 
 I never tire of the beautiful pictures in these books.  Although not everything was "doable" in my own home, it was inspiring to look at Rachel Ashwell's gorgeous home.  I love that she has a relatively small house (by California standards), making every inch count.  Simplicity and beauty intertwine 
 I am truly thrilled with the book, a truly great satirical work. Highly humorus. I purchased a paperback and a 1st Edition of the book thru Amazon and I am happy with both purchases. Thank 
 Ive been listening to this album for what feels like forever. and i still analyse the songs and relate. For those who know the offspring and what there newer albums have to offer please for the love of god check this out and it will be a life changing experience.. then thank me! After all who else writes legendary lines like "if you look away, you'll be doing what they say, and if you look alive you will be singled out and tried" i mean who? Also(going off the album) you get a cance to see them live, the atmosphere created is one of a kind 
 I've never found another book like this one. It makes it extremely easy to understand, breathtakingly clear, how our choices to consume various products cause a chain of events which harm the environment. Do you know  what was done to a river in Canada to produce the six-pack of aluminum cans  you just bought? What part of the earth did your coffee come from, and what  scary things were done to produce it? The authors never hector or nag, they  just describe the origin of things you probably use every day, and let you  contemplate them for yourself. The book is a quick and easy read, suitable  for adults and teens alike. If I were a high school teacher or college  instructor, this book would be mandatory reading for my classes 
 This is a remake that is done well.  Buck Henry had his signature all over this (and was even in front of the camera playing the new, bumbling Escort).  If you like the Catch 22, or Get Smart type of humor, this is very similar. Warren Beatty does a great job.  He is funny, too.  Solid cast.  Worth the price 
 Meridon is the third and last book in a 3-book series about the Lacey women who struggle to own/manage their family estate, called Wideacre, in a time when female children did not inherit any ownership rights of their family property. All three books in this series are enjoyable, and Phillippa Gregory adds period details that give you insight into life in England at that time. This book was my least favorite out of the three, partly because some of the language and settings were repeated from the first two books, and also because Meridon's life as a gypsy didn't seem quite as believable as the stories in the first two novels. Meridon was still an interesting conclusion to the series as I was interested to see if the women in the Lacey family ever gained control of their estate.  
 The vast majority of Americans believe that the U.S. is engaged in a "Culture War,"  Indeed, this is true, but where they go wrong is in assuming that the war is carried out by two titanic forces known as the Democrat and Republican parties - the white and black-hatted combatants, or the black and white-hatted combatants, depending upon where the observer stands.  The truth is that BOTH parties are wearing black hats, and the raging battle played out daily in Washington and the various media outlets is for public consumption only.  The REAL war theater is elsewhere.  My best analogy is a "Punch-And-Judy" show.  While the audience (the public at large) is engrossed in the fisticuffs between two warring enemies, behind the scenes, a single entity controls both participants.  If you wish to see beyond the marionettes and get a look at the puppeteer, you'll need to read printed material that exists outside of The Establishment's  imprimatur.  Such as James Perloff's, 'THE SHADOWS OF POWER.'  I can hear a few of you balking already: "It sounds like he's referring to a...a...a...(shhh)...conspiracy."  Welcome to the REAL world, friend.  It's about time you woke up and smelled the arsenic!  'THE SHADOWS OF POWER' is a well-researched and well-written expose on the heart of the matter: The Council On Foreign Relations - which is not "Ground Zero" of the Conspiracy, but it does represent the visible moving parts, the meshing gears, the framers and roofers and electricians building 'The New World Order' structure from the blueprint provided by the "architects" hidden from public view - the "wizards" behind the curtain.  More than you know, you need to read this book if you.....  * Have no idea what the C.F.R. is and wants.  * Think the Federal Reserve, which controls the U.S. economy, is a government agency.  * Wonder why the U.S. sent young men to fight Communism in Asia only 3 years after permitting (and assisting in) the establishment of a Soviet satellite just 150 miles off the coast of Florida.  * Still can't figure out how and why the U.S. lost that war with two-bit Communists in Asia.  * Were watching nice little stories on the Seven O'Clock news about Presidents Bill 'n' Hill [*See them tote their Bible to church and sing praises with the congregation.]; their nice daughter, Chelsea; and their nice little dog, Buddy, while sensitive technology with military capability was being sold to the Red Chinese without comment from the mainstream media.  One chapter of particular interest is 'A Second Look At Ronald Reagan.'  Reagan "chalked up more government debt than all the Presidents before him COMBINED!"  He was touted as an enemy of taxation and big government, and yet, although he did cut tax rates, "also pushed through the largest single tax increase in our nation's history, as well as boosts in the gasoline and Social Security taxes."  Although critical of Jimmy Carter for abiding by the Salt II Treaty, which the Senate didn't ratify, later as President, Reagan ordered two Poseidon ballistic missile submarines DISMANTLED to ensure we stayed within Salt II limits.  And that's just the beginning!  'The Media Blackout' chapter is also very enlightening.  Here we learn of Nicaragua's former President, Anastasio Somoza's complaint about the deliberate hatchet job he received at the hands of Dan Rather and 60 Minutes.  It reveals the power to promote an agenda and sway the public perception that major print and media outlets possess.  And it should force most Americans to reconsider how many of their current beliefs might have been artificially induced by the manipulative mainstream media.  Perloff wrote this book while a member of The John Birch Society.  Hopefully by now he's realized that the J.B.S. is less than sincere in its efforts to combat global Collectivism.  Although the book was published in 1988, it's every bit as relevant now as it was then because the C.F.R. program hasn't changed - evidenced by today's headlines, and discerned by anyone who knows how the game is played.  If there's ONE thing I've learned in studying politics over these many years, it's this: It's NEVER what politicians SAY that counts; it's strictly what they DO.  To the detriment of the People of the United States, when the Democrat party takes power, it usually keeps its campaign promises.  Equally detrimental, the Republican party doesn't.  And because I love the U.S. Constitution, I despise them both!  Get this book and see who's standing in the shadows and pulling the strings on those two puppets. 
 This is a book that every parent should read. Whether or not you are a parent of a toddler or a teenager, after reading this book, you will learn how to interact with your children in a more productive manner.  The basic premise is that everyone reacts to five different love "languages." These are quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service and physical touch. However, each of us has a primary love "language" that we identify with more strongly. Once we figure out what our children's primary love language is, we will be able to better understand their personal communication methods. Even though children need to feel love through all five of the love languages, their primary love "tank" must be filled in order for the other languages to be affective.  The authors offer practical guides in how to figure out your child's primary love language and how to keep their "tanks" filled. They also offer excellent suggestions with disciplinary methods that won't affect your child's perceptions of the way they feel loved by their parents. I highly recommend this book to anyone with children or even for those planning to have them. Although this book focuses mainly on children, the same principles can be applied to adults and our relationships with our spouses or friends as well. As a matter of fact, the authors have written other books for such relationships.  After reading this book, I can definitely see how these concepts applied to my childhood as well as my life as an adult now. I believe that, as I was growing up, my primary love "language" was "quality time." Looking back, I can see that the other love languages were not as effective if my primary love "tank" wasn't filled. For example, If I had received a great gift from someone, it didn't mean as much to me if I hadn't felt like they recently spent much quality time with me. As an adult, my love language has definitely changed. Now, I respond much more positive to "words of affirmation" than anything else. This goes a long way to explain why when someone "puts me down" or otherwise makes me feel unwanted with their words why I intend to take it very personally. They are using my love language against me. I especially notice this when my children scream at me out of anger. It makes me feel like they don't like or love me, even though I know this not to be true. The book strongly urges parents, when disciplining, to not use the same love language that their child most closely relates to. It can be excruciating for them. This, I believe, is the most important aspect of learning to use the love languages. It can also be the hardest as it often requires us change our more reactionary insticts when dealing with our children

 The saga of Jedediah Smith began at age 23, and ended ten years later, in 1831, when, on the Santa Fe trail, he was killed by indians when he stopped for a drink from a stream.  He was one of the first true mountain men and trappers whose life story, during those ten years, introduces the reader to others whose names are more familiar now than his own.  He died before the western movement began that relied so heavily upon the knowledge of such persons.  Yet it is doubtful that any, except perhaps Kit Carson, came close to exploring so much country, much of it alone, or nearly so.  The book is a scholarly presentation of his incredible feats each, for the most part, intended to discover the elusive beaver.  Jedediah's territory covered the then unknown expanse ranging from the confluence of the Yellowstone and the Missouri Rivers, current site of Fort Union where I purchased my book, to Oregon, California as far south as LA, east along the Old Spanish Trial and the Gila River as well as into NM and everywhere in between.  His knowledge of so vast a country was invaluable and, in  spite of his untimely death, contributed mightily to what eventually would become known as Manifest Destiny. Some are destined to contribute whether intended or not. The book deserves a place in the library of every serious student of the west.  As a CA resident, I have the advantage of having traveled by car, and know well, the land this man walked.  It is amazing.  Highly recommended 
 The songs on this CD are awesome!  I particularly like the awesome songs titled "One, Two, I Love you" and "Watch This".  I like Clay Walker's awesome voice.  And I like His awesome videos.  Buy this  awesome CD at some awesome store or at this awesome website 
 Online Customer Care is a rich compendium of important insights into people, technologies, and trends affecting businesses who recognize that it costs us 10 times more to win new customers than to retain the ones we already have.  Cusack writes clearly, and from experience. His careful analysis of the myriad technologies, human-factors, and trends affecting an organization's ability to automate relationships through quick and relevant solutions should be on the desktop of every CEO who understands "it's where the revenue comes from.&quot 
 I didn't take the class, but I read an older edition of this book.  It was something like 200 pages of history reading, basically straight facts.  The interpretation of events is left up to you.  I took this test without the class and got a five, so I recommend it.  As a reference, though, I'm a National Merit Finalist and passed 5 other AP tests 
 I agree with other reviewers that the maps and images are of very poor quality but the quality of the writing far offsets that. One of the best books I have read this year! I highly recommend it, especially if you are as ignorant of what this voyage was like as I was 
  Comfort Snowberger is a 10 year old girl whose family owns a funeral parlor and lives on the premises. The whole family works in the business. Thus, Comfort has been to hundreds of funerals. This is not a normal thing for a ten year old girl. Comfort is a very unique and unusual girl.   I was especially impressed with Comfort's voice. It is, like her, unique and unusual. Part of this, I'm sure, is the setting, Mississippi. There is a strong southern flavor which extends to people's names as well. Comfort's brother is Tidings, her  dog is Dismay, her best friend is Declaration, and her whiny cousin is Peach.  Comfort sits in the closet when she needs to think. She visits the cemetery frequently to talk to dead friends and relatives. She also plays normal kid's games and has friends who are normal kids as well. However, Comfort's friends understand her uniqueness. And, it seems, she does not have a wide circle of friends. Comfort is also a writer of cookbooks (how to make food dishes for funerals) and a writer of obituaries, which she reads regularly as well. The most important thing in her life is her dog, Dismay. Dismay is also not the usual dog. He is a funeral dog. He provides comfort to those who are grieving.  Comfort is not like any ten year old girl I have known but I would really like to meet her someday. She has a way of looking at the world that is unlike most people I have known. It would be interesting to spend a day with her, but after reading the book, I feel that in some way I have met her.   Each Little Bird That Sings is a unique story for children. I'm not so sure, however, that it is written at the level that most children understand. While Comfort certainly seems in many ways to be a ten year old, in some other ways she seems far beyond her years. The book had a great deal of humor, but again, I'm not sure that children got a lot of it. Certainly, much of it is at an adult level. I truly enjoyed this book because it took a unique setting with a unique character to go along with it. Growing up in a funeral home is not a common theme in children's literature. I think the author did an outstanding job with such an unusual theme, but did not always target the age of her audience. 
 This book is a great book to add to any D&D library.   Let me first say that this book focuses on 6 main races Aboleths, Beholders, Mind Flayers, Neogi, Grell And Tsochars.  It has a large amount of info regarding each of the races stated above.  Along with some new monsters that are great.  The book is well done giving the history of each race about its society and any other info one would need for them. It has great art work to witch I love to see in a D&D book.  It also comes with a few new adventures regarding each race.  My only flaw is that it doesnt cover more aberrations but that is understandable.  It also has a few new feats, spells,[still no new power for the psionic player wizard seems to ignore that they exist] and classes.  To sum up this would be a great book for any DM that wishes to add any of the races in to there campaign.  Or for the player who wishes to learn more of Aberrations.       
 When I first heard of Sinfulnyms, I thought it was a great idea! I communicate often with buddies who work for an "unnamed" corporation who regularly monitors emails so I ordered it right away. To my surprise and delight, I not only got some great ideas for using Sinfulnyms in my daily emails, but great cartoons too. The cartoonist really captures the "essence" of the sinfulnyms in ways readers of popular Adult magazines would appreciate. What fun! Eating OATMEAL for breakfast will never be the same! 
 Excellent, excellent, excellent.  This book had it all - the inside scoop as well as the well reported facts of the case.  I enjoyed reading about the wire taps and conversations that were not part of the trial transcript.  I also enjoyed learning about the dysfunction within the Peterson family that helps us all to understand Scott Peterson's behavior a bit more, perhaps.  Photos of the evidence were also appreciated.  My only criticism of this book is that I did find a few errors - incorrect dates, incorrect names or circumstances - that seemingly were glaringly obvious.  I would chew out the editor vs. the author, however.  I highly recommend this book written by a seasoned writer with excellent skills.  I also recommend Sharon Rocha's book "For Laci" 
 The book is exceedingly lucid in its style and  very informative to all seekers of knowledge in the field of Fullerene Chemistry.Fullerene has the distinct place of being the molecule of the  last century.Its applications  being enormous are dealt with in an excellent way.         "Nature"-a lover of symmetry is perhaps manifested as the black  beauty in the form of C-60.What an insight the book provides for the  prospective researchers in this discipline to  seek more only to be found 
 We use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my 1- and 2-year old children. It's intended for children a little older, and I can see why, as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps. However, my 2-year-old can use it by herself, and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys. I had to hold it in place for my 1-year-old, but when doing so, it also allowed him to color. I would recommend it, especially for children 3 and up. 
 this book, the Education of the Heart, is translated in Chinese. When I read this book, I am enjoyed. it is not book than can read at once, but you could read it every time. In this book, the greatest man ask me what is the soul,and how to care of it. sometimes, I feel so tire that can't do anything, and by reading this book, I could gain the power for my life. Well, I like this book.  I hope you like it too 
 I loved this book and agree with nearly all the superlatives other reviewers have applied to it.  But I was startled by the sloppy editing -- or perhaps there was no editing.  I was distracted by spelling mistakes (as in "their" for "there"); by faulty usage (as in "the reason is because"); by Darwin's work being called "Origin of The Species" (a common glitch, but still...); and by far too many other minor errors and awkwardnesses. Some sections, particularly those arguing a point, suffer from repetition and need tightening; at half the length they would be more convincing.  I'm thinking particularly of the polemic against Edward Said in the Introduction, and also the chapter called "Women."  I like the author's quirky approach, his inclusion of personal anecdote, the four short biographies of four fascinating people although quite peripheral to his main focus, and the many wonderful notes included with the identifications of the breathtaking pictures.  But I am giving only four stars, in protest to the editors at Laynfaroh (who are they, anyway?) who didn't do their job 
 Same good quality Everlast product that I would have received if I purchased these gloves at the sporting goods store.  And, much more convenient and time efficient. A pleasant experience 
 We used Rick Steve's guide to help plan our honeymoon in Italy. It was our first time to Europe and Rick was so right on about Hotels, restaurants, and especially touring. Using his tips we avoided long lines at some of the major sites (especially in Florence!) Next time we visit Europe we'll definatley use his guides again 
 I really enjoyed reading this book and I highly recommend it to any one who wants to read a well written and sweet novel. The principal character is Molly Gibson who is the daughter of a small town doctor. The story is mainly about what happens with Molly and those she loves when her father remarries and his new wife and stepdaughter come to live with him and Molly. The story is simple, but at the same time enchanting. Mrs. Gaskell's excellent writing will keep you reading even though some parts of the story are full with details and past stories of the characters. But at the same time, it is these background stories and details which allow the reader to really understand who each character is in the story and how they feel. So I don't don't agree with those who sugget that the book needs editing.  The novel is full with very interesting characters and all are presented in a way you'll end up feeling close to them, and caring for them. Even Mrs. Gibson and Lady Cumnor, who are mean and selfish, will claim your sympathy at some point because the author has the ability to present her characters not as good or bad, but just as human. She has an incredible way of describing regular people. And only this characteristic makes the book very enjoyable.   The book is long and does not have an ending... nonetheless, it is so beautiful!!!... I really recommend this novel because you'll never get bored. Even more, you'll learn to enjoy each of the things and stories that are going on in Hollingford (the little town where Molly lives)!. And although this is not an "addictive" reading, there are some parts in the novel where you cannot stop reading and for a hundred pages you won't be able to put it down. I think this is a novel to enjoy, not to read in an afternoon.  The fact that this novel is unfinished could be a drawback for some people, but the story is almost complete and you can tell what will happen at the end. Besides, all novels end at one point, and no matter how much the author tells us about the story, we readers always want to know more. So, I think that you can easily imagine what will happen in the last chapter in the same way that you can imagine what will happen with Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy at the end of Pride Prejudice (even though Jane Austen never wrote about that).  I agree that there is some similarity between this author and Jane Austen because both authors have the same sweetness in their writing. However, Mrs. Gaskell provides more details about the setting and the characters of the novel. So, all and all I would recommend this novel to the Austen readers and to all of those who enjoy romantic and classic novels. 
 Scott Ott's ability to satirize the news and current events in an expeditious, gut-wrenchingly hilarious manner is unsurpassed.  I've been enjoying his satirical perspective on the news via his website (www.scrappleface.com)for quite awhile and this book is sent from heaven.  I'll periodically re-read Scott's satire from days past and laugh harder than I did the time I fell out of my chair when he first wrote it.    Scott is a master at mining the irony and humor buried deep within otherwise mundane news.  Who else could catch a New York Times headline that reads "Kerry in Florida Today" and whip up a quick satire piece that has thousands of people asking their co-workers: "Uh,.. why are you on the floor laughing so hard? 
 Think of them as U2 without the ego. Instead of the popular kid at school who was always visible and outspoken, James was more like the unassuming quiet guy you'd see every day and barely notice. But down-to-earth as they were, this group could write a mean hook and a joyful soaring chorus with the best of them. Combine that with some intelligent lyrics and a staying power underneath the catchiness, and you've got one of the most modest but fascinating pop catalogues out there. (Even with several hits, they'll always seem like an under-the-radar treasure to me. I'm sure I'm not the only one.) This set can't help seeming like a memento - farewell shows tend to do that - but as a live album it's also top-notch. The band puts everything they've got into a heartfelt performance, and a few small warts only make it that much more honest & personal.  Getting Away also makes a splendid introduction to the group - it covers their entire career in two hours, it's got some material you'd otherwise have to hunt down some import CDs for, and it shows their variety much better than the single-disc best-of. The ambience is almost palpable. The energy is infectious from start to finish. It's easy to imagine how well some of the tunes must have worked as bouncy arena singalongs, but there's also a sincerity that can't be faked, from the modest jokes about technical glitches to Tim Booth's parting farewell ("I'd love to invite you all home for milk and cookies"). Like all James, this stuff is always fresh and never fails to give me a lift. At the heart of it all it's a group and an audience having a great time enjoying some excellent songs.. no flash or showiness required. Simple and fairly common, yes, but it's something that never gets old 
 Funny, great review of the Yiddish the new generations are forgetting, using classic Dick and Jane format (only those who heard Yiddish growing up may remember) to a modern day biting reality stor

 I bought this set for my daughter, but I think I like it as much as she does 
 Not only is the author knowledgable about the topic, but I like the manner in which he makes his points through real life anacdotes. I use the same technique in my book: The Constant-Sum Approach to Business Success" 
 If you like to read histories of the great age of scientific discovery, you'll enjoy this story of William Smith and his development of the world's first geology map.  The bonus is the dustcover is actually a copy of his map 
 "Who asks for me, the Shelley of my age, must lay his heart out for my bed and board."  In a short, tumultous life, Hart Crane (1899 -- 1932) wrote two of the greatest books of 20th Century American poetry: White Buildings (1926) and the Bridge (1930) as well as some splendid individual poems.  His poetry is collected in this outstanding volume of the Library of America, edited by Langdon Hammer of Yale University.    Of the 850 pages of this book, only 144 are devoted to Crane's poetry.  Most of the remainder of the text consists of 14 short essays by Crane and of 412 letters from his extensive correspondence written between 1910 and his suicide in 1932.  These letters, together with Professor Hammer's notes and biographical sketches of Crane's correspondents, offer the reader a good portrait of Crane's troubled life, and they read with more immediacy and poignancy than any biography.  Crane dropped out of high school and left an unhappy home in Cleveland at the age of 17 to try to make his way as a poet in New York.  Many of the letters in this collection detail Crane's stormy relationship with his parents, his father Clarence ("C.A.") Crane, a wealthy chocolate manufacturer, and his mother Grace Hart Crane.  Crane was also close to his maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Belden Hart. In the "Quaker Hill" section of The Bridge, Crane said that the he had to "Shoulder the curse of sundered parentage". His difficult, shifting relationship with his family is amply chronicled in these letters.  But this collection includes much more than correspondence with a broken family. They offer insight into Crane's poetic ambitions and into the composition of The Bridge and of the shorter poems.  They offer a view of  New York City, seen through Crane's eyes, and of his literary friends and contemporaries, including Allen Tate, Waldo Frank, Yvor Winters, Malcolm Cowley, Peggy Cowley,  Crane's patron Otto Kahn, and many others. The letters give the reader a portrait of a complex, troubled person who from late adolescence lived life hard and on the edge.  Crane was promiscuous with a lengthy series of mostly homosexual affairs together with longer-term relationships with men and women. Crane's most intense male relationship was with a sailor named Emil Opffer (none of his letters to Opffer survive) and, just before his death, he had a passionate heterosexual relationship in Mexico with Peggy Cowley, as she was divorcing Malcolm Cowley.  From his mid-20s Crane had deep problems with alcoholism which greatly hindered his ability to write.  He was perpetually short of money and cadged and borrowed extensively from his friends and family.  He fought constantly and was jailed several times.  In a fit of depression  -- when his life superficially seemed to be looking up he committed suicide by jumping off a ship, the Orizaba, en route from Cuba to New York City.  Read as a whole, this collection of Crane's correspondence and poetry raises difficult and probably unanswerable questions about the relationship between Crane's life and his work.  Crane's excesses and passions in fact are an important component of his poetry. But while the life was a failure, Crane was a poet of romantic vision.  Crane struggled for years to complete "The Bridge", a work which remains controversial and not unqualifiedly successful. In this poem, Crane took the Brooklyn Bridge as a symbol and tried to create a myth, in the machine age, that would unite America's past with its future and also give meaning to his own life. (Much of The Bride is autobiographical.)  The Bridge is a work of difficult optimism as Crane traces America back to the voyages of Columbus and the days of Pocahontas with Walt Whitman and Edgar Allan Poe as guides.  The poems ends on a note of affirmation and hope, as The Bridge becomes a path to transcendence and to the overcoming of materialism and lifeless routine through love and brotherhood.  Crane's short poems are higly concentrated and difficult. The poems I find most rewarding in "White Buildings" include "Voyages" a six-poem sequence detailing an intense love affair and "For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen" which is a predecessor of "The Bridge."  The shorter poems include "At Mellvile's Tomb", the subject of an exchange with Harriet Monroe included in this collection, and "Chaplinesque."  One of Crane's masterpieces is his final poem "The Broken Tower" which describes how "I entered the broken world/To trace the visionary company of love, its voice/An instant in the wind." The Broken Tower ends on a note on the redemptive power of love while, soon after completing the poem, Hart Crane would commit suicide.  This is a volume that will bring Hart Crane to his readers.  The letters chronicle a sad life cut short by excess.  But Hart Crane's poetry, brief in amount though it is, has stayed with and inspired me for many years. Hart Crane holds a high place in America's literary heritage.  He deserves his place in the Library of America.  The quotation at the beginning of this review is from Robert Lowell's sonnet "Words for Hart Crane" in his collection "Life Studies".  Robin Friedma 
 This rosary cd has a quote and meditation from St. Therese for each Hail Mary.  They are wonderful meditations and inspiring, making this rosary cd a joy to listen to too.  Everyone I have told about this cd that bought it as well, agrees. This is probably the best rosary cd I have come across.  My husband & children enjoy listening, as well 
 This is a great book for anyone starting out or all ready in to the business, this book is easy to read, lots of information,  and great pictures. I have chickens already but still love to learn new things, great book 
 This is a wonderful book that not only covers the whole field of genetics, but does so with just the right amount of detail and reiteration so that you find yourself grasping the terms. Very clear drawings illuminate the text and take the complexity out of everything from Mendelian inheritance to mRNA transcription. Not once did I find myself wondering what something meant.  When I finished I felt fully briefed and was amazed at how easy it was to understand what I had always felt was a baffling subject.  Want to know how cancer occurs? Why people are worried about genetically modified foods? How mutation is always occurring and can be a good thing? How "junk" DNA is distinguished from the genes that are read to create the protein that composes our bodies? How DNA can compact itself in the cell? How crime labs can find the culprit through a genetic fingerprint? It's all here and much much more. You'll have a hard time reading any one page without exclaiming "wow!", "no kidding!" or "so THAT'S how it works!"  I eagerly began each chapter because the titles always made me think, "Yeah, I was wondering about that!"  The humor, thank goodness, is mostly in the subtitles (Cloning: There Will Never Be Another You) and the text is largely free of attempts to make you laugh. That's good because when you get so excited to find out more, humor just gets in the way.  Terms that are introduced in one place will be mentioned again later with a reference if you have forgotten a definition. Just when you might be getting confused, the author will tell you how the subject might differ from what was covered before.  When you are done you will be awed by what you've learned: that all the complexity of life is based on simple chemical bonds within structures that have become elaborated over 100's of millions of years. If there is one subject that we will probably never comprehend, and that no Dummies book will be able to reveal, it is time itself.  PS: I recommend Richard Dawkins new book "The Ancestor's Tale" after reading this book 
 George Bowling's life is pretty mundane even by his own admission: he has "settled down" into his middle age with his wife and two children, his mortgage and his steady yet uninteresting job. Frustrated, George looks back to the days of his childhood in a small town in rural England and asks where did it all go wrong? He tries to recapture those times, but can anyone really go home again?  This is a beautifully written, funny and at times poignant story. Orwell depicts (with great skill) the dangers of middle-age drift, and of trying to escape from it by revisiting a past which only exists inside your head. He takes a swipe at various irritating types (many of them still around) such as the "respectable" middle classes who believe they are living in the countryside and are protecting it when they are in fact doing neither.  It is interesting in that the feeling of decay, of falling standards seems to afflict each generation in turn. Although Bowling is careful not to idolise his past, pointing to the many faults of the society he grew up in, the novel does reveal that there is nothing new in nostalgia.  G Rodger 
 This book was such a joy to read.  I found it hilarious.  Yes, it's silly & unbelievable at times (like other reviewers suggested), but it's FICTION PEOPLE!  Of course the characters are over-the-top, it's based in LA.  I got the book from my sister & passed it on to many friends.  They all loved it.  It's a light, easy read that will take your mind off of your own problems and allow you to escape into the shallow lives of the rich & beautiful. P.S.- another great read that is similar to this is The Nanny Diaries 
 i saw the epizode of Oprah featuring Greg in his "bad news bringer" role.  almost didn't need the book after the show, as they went thru pretty much all the possible situations we girls find ourselves in when/cuz we like the guy more than he likes us. however, i started reading it again last night, as i seem to need often reminders. if the guy is not SHOWING you, calling you, asking you out, smsing you all day and night (and 3 minutes after you parted) he is not tha into you, and sticking around is exercise in your frustration. if he does.. well, you know what that feels like, having a guy head over heels? it it ain't like that, he ain't head over heels. if he ain't head over heels, he ain't that into you, and he will be looking for the one he will be. again, exercise in your frustration. move the hell on. i am 
 This is the only figure in the Apocalypse series that dose not have a variant figure. Kinda makes you wish it were the Sentinel series, and if you can find them, most of them are variants that you might actually want. I was fortunate enough to hit Wal-Mart at a time when the shelves must have been just stocked, because the racks were full, and all five variants were right there in front. Needless to say I bought all 5. But Maestro, as far as I know has had one appearance in the entire Marvel Universe, so what variant is even possible. Despite some protests that this is "another Hulk figure" this is not some namby pamby rehashed Hulk with screaming action, fist pounding, and slightly purplier pants that we've seen a dozen times before, but an almost entirely all new figure. One reviewer said the body was based on the Smart Hulk figure, but I wasn't lucky enough to snag one, so I don't have a basis of comparrison. However, he is well muscled, warty, and weathered alot like he looks in the included issue of Captain Marvel. And if your wondering just what exactly to do with him, fear not, Captain Marvel is to be released in Series XV near the end of this year. Then he can go a few rounds with your Maestro. Now ML, where's our Legends 2099 Spidey? (He was also in that CM comic.) He is a good figure, could be a little bigger, like more on scale with Juggernaut from Series VI, but he does come with the Apocalypse piece whcich is a great figure in and of itself 
 As a long time urban explorer, this book didn't really tell me much I didn't already know or that a little common sense couldn't figure out once you have been to a few places. That fact notwithstanding, this is a great introductory book to the art of urban exploration, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into the hobby. It has lots of good pointers that would have been a lot easier to read then they were to figure out in my own 
 The title translated into German used to be 'Schuld und Suehne' which translates into 'Guilt and Attonement'. The book appears now with the new translated title of 'Verbrechen und Strafe' which translates into 'Crime and Punishment'. What was the author really thinking by almost excusing the crime? Are we now less forgiving 
 This is the sixteenth book in Terry Pratchett's series on the Discworld - a flat world, supported on the backs of four massive elephants riding on the back of a planet-sized turtle. Anything hilarious can happen here, and eventually does.   In this book, Death (capital "D", he's the man, or rather the anthropomorphic personification) disappears, and his granddaughter (that's another story) is forced to pick up the family business. But, there's something very strange going on here. A young man who was supposed to die has been strangely saved by music, and the music now owns him. It has all happened before, somewhere else, but now it has come to the Discworld - sex and drugs and Music With Rocks In!  This is one of Terry Pratchett's masterpieces, and that is really saying something. I like all of the Discworld books, but several are special, like this one. This is a great book, laugh-out-loud funny with lots of great references to rock music and movies. Beyond that, though, the story is very entertaining, and will keep you sitting up at night turning pages (like it did to me).  This is one of the Discworld greats, a book that I highly recommend to all fans of great fantasy literature! 
 Anyone who likes books such as "Royal Babylon" by Karl Shaw, or "A Treasury of Royal Scandals" by Michael Farquhar will love this book 
 I've been a Graphic Designer for 20 years. While taking a 2-D course recently, I found this book a well-written resource. 
 Zoroaster, Krishna, Buddha, Christ, Muhammad, and many other founders of mainsteam legitimate religions have offered a connection to God for many people. The definition of a religion is that it offers a unique holy book independant of any other faith and has a central founder whose life is a testament to sacrifice. This book gives an explanation of the W5 of each faith and one universal theme remains - Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The Golden Rule is universal. So if you get anything out of this wonderful book it is this .... before you do anything .... especially to one who is innocent ... remember this because karma may come from Hinduism but it too is universal - what goes around comes around 
 Why is it that Christian music is (on average) about 5 or 6 years behind secular mainstream? I mean, it's like they know that since they're a Christian band, it's supposed to be dulled down to make sure it doesn't offend and to ensure a spot on KLove? It's because of these reasons that I gave up on Christian music for a few years. Until now.  "Devotion" has taken that and thrown the theory out the window. This praise and worship (yes, both) album is unbelievable. This is one of those albums you can sing along with at the top of your lungs and feel great about because you're praising God at the same time! Remember that annointing on "Let it Rain" off of MWSmith's first "Worship" album? It's all over this one. So so so good! Buy it! BUY IT 
 I found this book to be very comprehensive, easy to understand and an excellent resource before and after surgery. I would recommend it to any woman considering hysterectomy 
 This book deals with the foibles as well as the greatness of probably the best know of the 18th century captains fighting for Americans Independence. He was not a cultured gentleman with a university education.  He did become a self educated man by study on the ships that he served and he went to sea at an early age. This remember was at a time when sailors were forced to serve and many became put to irons and those that were not often climbed masts, sails and ropes in choppy waters with high winds.  Jones did not receive the recognition he deserved in American until over 100 years after his death.  His greatest accomplishment to this reader was bringing the War for U.S. Independence to Britain.  He realized that unless the British people were aware of Americas resolve they would not oppose the war. He would send landing parties and create excitement in Britain. His efforts and his association with Ben Franklin brought the respect of the French. He was proud and apparently had quite a temper that hampered his advancement in the American Admiralty or Navy.  The poor diet and conditions on 18 th century sailing vessels affected his health. In The later part of his career he served the French Navy and the Russian Navy. This reviewer asks that you read this biography and believes you will enjoy it also. 
 So far I have read only the last two chapters. They deal with the case in court. I was pleasantly surprised to find   the author,Mr. Karem ,  understood the  nuances of the case so well that his writing  was not 90%,not 99% , but 100% accurate. I'm amazed because even the attorneys on such complicated cases rarely exceed an understanding of about 80%  Others who were involved in the case  tell me the rest of the book  faithfully recounts the actions of  Eliza(hanged herself in jail) and Sarah.By the way,on 9/12/05  Sarah's appeal was denied 
 My daughter will take this book turn the pages, play with each page by flipping up the toolbox lid, picking up the newspaper page and so on. She will bring this book over to her dad so that he can read it to her and she does the same with me. I can't say enough about this book and any book with flip pages in them. They keep any child starting to explore their world very busy 
 Allison's masterful and now classic work brings back the long ignored importance of the notion of intuition into Kant scholarship. Allison sees that only by beginning with intuition can the totality of Kant's epistemology be properly framed. Allison's work is a colossal advancement in the literature. (See also Allison's earlier _The Kant-Eberhard Controvery_. 
 Dr. John Dolittle (Eddie Murphy) has the so called "perfect life", a beautiful wife, two loving daughters and a career that could not be better.  All that changes one night when he nearly hits a dog with his car.  As he is leaving, the dog calls him a bonehead then runs off. From that day on his childhood ability to communicate with animals is back.  Soon, animals are showing up at his home to get help.  His colleagues suspect he's going crazy and many decisions still have to be made regarding the sale of the clinic.  Just as everything is about to fall apart, a circus tiger falls seriously ill and it's John's turn to prove to everyone that he's not crazy 
 I now know what some raters mean by "Old Opeth and new Opeth" This old Opeth is really agressive and heavy,the growls are different and the subjects are more refined. This recording is a genius of an effort,the first with Mendez and Lopez on rhythym section. The music is just awesome and is hungry with creativity.The slow songs add to the concept and characters.  Others think their others are more Opeth.This one,along with "Blackwater Park, My Arms..." and "Deliverance" are the best ,hands down. "Ghost Reveries" sounds a little too over-produced and under composed,perhaps because of the absence of Steve Wilson. Anyhow,this one is simply a masterpiece classic 
 Very huge fine prints and good references. Definitely a must get if you like reading Bibl 
 Enjoyed the book and liked the idea behind the method of this meditation.  I have been doing it for quite sometime now and I absolutely notice a much better calmness about myself.  Others have noticed as well 
 I like these notebooks very much. The cover is very sturdy and the pages have a nice weight to them. The size is perfect for your back pocket or jacket. I use these books to jot down notes from meetings with clients. The small pocket in the rear of the book is handy for storing business cards 
 I found this book to be somewhat erotic although I've read better stories in the past.. My boyfriend did enjoy me reading it to him and he got pretty aroused by it.. 
 Nawal El Saddawi is one of the most prolific and poignant writers of our time.  Both her fiction and non-fiction writing is beautiful and insperational.  I highly recomend this book 
 Growing up in the 60's and watching Batman series, which I knew was corny, campy but cool, this movie is sort of a story, plot documentry using flashbacks that Adam West & Burt Ward have throughout the movie. I enjoyed it very much, and now know that the dynamic duo were also dynamic womanizers.  This is a great movie for anyone who grew up watching the Batman episodes with a towel cape around his or her neck. The actors who portray the dynamic duo in the flashbacks are dead ringers as well.  Delightfully done !  
 This book is absolutely beautiful. When I ordered it I had no idea what exactly I would be getting when it arrived; I'm pleased to say though that it was worth every penny. The book in itself is all very glossy and high quality paper, and even the text pages are decorative. I found this book to be over all very visually appealing as well as very interesting and informative as it peers into the history of the art as well as Dita's life and opinions. It's really a bit half and half, written like a documentary but also filled with very intimate and warm stories of this fantastic woman`s life. 
 I had seen this book in an airport bookstore, but wasn't sold until I saw Patton: the movie on TV and was entranced by George C. Scott's portrayal of the WWII General.  General George S. Patton commanded the Third Army in Europe during WWII.  Although I had never realized it before, Patton really managed a giant corporation, an army of over 400,000 soldiers which built almost 2500 bridges, shipped over 2,000,000 tons of supplies, and inflicted hundreds of thousands of casualties on the enemy.    After a short preface by George Steinbrenner (Red Sox fans will start on pg. 3), Axelrod begins with a short description of Patton's history and life philosophy.  Patton was certainly a fascinating character, with compelling qualities and outrageous flaws.    The format of the book proceeds as follows: Axelrod uses a quote or anecdote from Patton's life to convey and support Patton's philosophy on leadership.  Although the subjects are grouped together (Chapter 3:Always attack. Never Surrender and Chapter 5:Speed-simplicity-boldness), the book does not refer back to any previous section.  Fans of the movie will recognize many parts of the book, but those who know nothing about Patton will also find it an easy yet exciting read.  I found it to be quite valuable.  This book is certainly not a whitewash of Patton's career, but Axelrod does a fantastic job of sifting through his life and finding the kernels of Patton's success.  I recommend this book to anybody interested in leadership (coaches), those in business, and those with an interest in military affairs.   
 When a pair of writers with special skills in the social science of espionage put their heads together, you can hear the resulting "click" in the pages of this very special book. Espionage, after all, is the art of the possible. A knows something and B wants to find out A) what A knows and B) how he knows what it is. It's a simple, elegant geometry, and Shulsky knows it better than LeCarre. I came to this text hoping to find out more about the world of intelligence. I figured, there's got to be more to it than the cartoonish figure than Kiefer Sutherland plays on TV's 24, surrounded by his loyal staff Tony and Michelle.    And there's got to be more going on but if so, how did the USA land in such an awful dilemma as to depend on its intelligence committees which suggested that, for example, there are WMD's in Iraq when as it turns out, if there ever were any, there don't seem to be any now. As Shulsky points out, there's almost no blame-sharing protocol within intelligence agencies. It's as if God made them and then forgot to teach them the words, "I'm sorry." This is the one book in which you can learn why this should be so. Intelligence has changed rapidly in the years since the Cold War ended, and there are some satisfying books you could follow up on for post-graduate work, but SILENT WARFARE is a savvy place to begin 
 Stuart Kaufman's At Home in the Universe is a lay redaction his scientific hypotheses from his Origins of Order, a rich, fascinating, sophisticated, and complementary set of hypotheses added to Darwin's theories of evolution. For the moment, at least, they are the promising fruit of speculative or theoretical biological hypotheses (with physics, chemistry, geology, paleontology, mathematics, game theory, and economics thrown in), but they go a long way to filling in many of the gaps that strict Darwinists seem content to ignore. And some of his hypotheses, he readily admits, are heretical.  One of the obvious problems, if not primary one, that Kaufman sets to answer, Is how can natural selection work, culling the fittest to survive, without something to act on? In other words, natural selection operates on the already existent (i.e., regressive engineering), not in the formation of the entity itself. Another problem is that 4 billion years, long as that is, is still not sufficient time for natural selection to have acted through a totally random, step-by-step process in determining today's survivors. Even 100 billion years would not be enough. Another problem is how could so many species have come into existence and failed to survive (99.9%), leaving a mere 100 million for the present, in the span of a mere 4 billion years (mathematically impossible on Darwin's theories alone).  The central theme of Kaufman's work is Self-organized Criticality, a scientific twist on the notion of irreducible complexity (from the Discovery Institute's lexicon, no less), where a minimal degree of inherent complexity in a subcritical-supercritical phase transition is what spontaneously orders the animate world and generates and sustains life in accord with other, as yet, unknown, but implicit laws. From the moment that a sufficiently critical diversity of molecules reached the ideal phase transition, life itself was "spontaneously generated" as inevitable, not by accident. Once life appeared, the acts of natural selection, adaptation, coevolution, evolution of coevolution, cellular, morphological, and physiological differentiation, ontogeny, niches, populations, stable cum-chaotic dynamics, etc., could operate, but in addition to forces beyond natural selection. And while speculative, apparently many scientists share Kaufman's intuitions, inferences, and insights.  But the "other" force or forces is not mystical, much less divine, even if they may be truly awesome. Rather, it is in the nature of the universe, and more particularly in our evolving earth, that these implicit laws work in tandem with Darwin's laws. At this point, these laws are posited from the empirical knowledge we do have, but have not yet demonstrated in the scientific manner to make them even hypotheses. But Kaufman's speculative biology is not a whimsical or arbitrary metaphysics, but logical inferences based on laws and facts already in place. Having done the easy work (thinking the notions of what these other general laws of nature must be like), now science must work in earnest to confirm or reject his speculative hypotheses.  The key word and concept throughout this humorous, heady, and exacting exposition is "complexity" and within the manifold complexities of lives, environments, and mutually intersecting dynamics is a spontaneous order that arises "for free" that in turn sustains stable and steady systems just at the subcritical-supercrticial phase transition (e.g., horizon, or "edge of chaos"). Another key word and concept is "dynamic." Steady-state and homeostasis are often thought of as a static plateau, but that is mistaken, as such states are actually in a fluctuating dynamic at the phase transition between equilibrium (death) and disequilibrium (disorder). Indeed, on many different levels, living organisms are born, dwell, and die precisely at this phase transition between the subcritical (stasis, moribund) and supercritical (chaotic, disordered) states. And the key thesis is that order ("for free") is embedded in the delicate balancing act precisely at this phase transition.  Kaufman extrapolates some of these implicit biological laws and applies them to human cultural and technological advancement. The "fit" is remarkably uncanny, helping us to understand some of the dynamics of technological improvements (and diminishing returns), innovation, extinction, and spontaneity of the economy. Perhaps the most salient features are the concepts of "dynamic" and "spontaneous."  Moreover, if an analogy can be drawn from the biosphere and ecology to the social and political realms, the overwhelming preponderance of biological evidence screams complexity, diversity, and interdependence of organisms and their environments, which arise spontaneously and reciprocally to each other, in a constant dynamic that is vibrant, active, and always on the threshold of "chaos," but retains some stability through change. It is only those social and political forms that are "adaptive" that are socially and politically the "fittest," and democracy and market economies are obviously the most adaptive mechanisms to adapt to changing human needs.  Frederick Hayek addressed himself to these very issues over 50 years ago, and called the market economy and democracies "spontaneous" associations, in contradistinction to "planned" economies and governments. The former "adapt" to changing environments and circumstances, while the latter lack flexibility, and thus do not easily yield to adaptive mechanisms. "Planned" economies attempt to calculate rationally human desires, motivations, and needs in either an abstract or a priori fashion, then calculate the mode of production, the degree, and whether to accommodate, as if some "Absolute Human Mind" could anticipate all contingencies and changes by a simple mathematical formula. The problem is that bureaucrats are notoriously theory-laden and too calculating to include, much less advance, diversity (think Medicare Part D for "planned" absurdity). In practice, socialisms impede innovation and stifle ingenuity. With no means of adaptation, there is no "fittest," much less any mechanism to adapt to the actual dynamics of the world.  Communism's planned economy is an extreme case of an irrational calculus asserting what the government will allow, applying the lowest-common denominator as a criterion of sufficiency. We all know of the U.S.S.R.'s food lines, limited products, forced housing, inferior merchandise, and minimal labor investment. But even weaker forms of the rational calculus, such as socialism, does not do much better. At least their democracies allow policies to change, even if it becomes years for government to adapt to the new exigencies. Even the most socialized societies have "capitalist" outlets, to provide some barometer of social wants and meeting them. Social insurance makes sense on many fronts, but social or state "planning" of economics has rotted state and worker. Kaufman's biological analogies explain why.  Postscript: Kaufman's book is a provocative, challenging, and fascinating (sometime heady) read. Even if all of his hypotheses in the abstract are found to be untrue, at least he captures the reader's imagination, and asks the questions that most of us non-dogmatic Darwinians have raised for some time. In a time when the "easy" and "orthodox" are all too convenient for slipping under the rug, Kaufman's questions (and suggested answers) go the the very nexus of the difficulties. His suggested answers are at once perhaps too simple, on the other hand, perhaps too complex. What is refreshing, above all, is that he's not afraid to ask, and even less fearful of suggesting solutions. Thank gawd for the Sante Fe Institute, where brave and curious minds still ask questions 
 Kidnapped from his home by white Christian brothers who brutalise him as part of his 'training' to become a priest, Malidoma describes his amazing journey back to his home village in Burkina Faso, West Africa.  The only way he can be truly accepted as one of his people - the Dagara - is to undergo a dangerous and possibly deadly initiation.  The second half of the book illustrates the poetic, mythical and very real ordeal Malidoma  undergoes in order to truly return home.  This powerful, moving book illustrates how African traditions are under threat and how we must learn to live harmoniously with people who are different from us - even the 'stranger and enemy' 
 This is a very interesting book set at the beginning of the American Revolution.  It's told from the viewpoint of an apprentice silversmith who lives in Boston.  It's a coming of age story that the whole family can enjoy.  Good character development and realistic scenes make for a great read 
 This is a fine book addressing the unconscious that has far more effect on our lives than we readily admit.  As Sigmund Freud said: "The mind is an iceberg-it floats with only 1/7 of its bulk above water."  [quoted in Leo Rosten's Carnival of Wit Dutton NY 1994, page 402].  Most of us have hidden, unconscious compulsions that control our lives in strange ways.  This book addresses many aspects of these forces, however, it is more Jungian than Freudian (with explanations of the anima/animus archetypes that greatly effect our relationships with the opposite sex).  Dr. Pederson tries to be impartial because as he states on pages 225-6: "Most behavioral research, however, is biased by the fact that the experimenters are interested, covertly or overtly, in establishing a particular point of view."    He also addresses the process of projection in which we project our inner feelings, orientations, problems, desires, etc. onto other individuals who are then said to carry these projections.  He states that these are stored in the body on page 220 (note 27): "A man's physical body and its various organs often carry the unconscious projections of emotional issues he needs to integrate into his awareness.  These symptoms can lead him to a deeper level of communication with himself if he takes the symptoms as signs of a need to sacrifice the rigidities and narrowness of his conscious attitudes."  Most interesting are his observations about the development of projection over time such as on page 87: "Early belief systems were undoubtedly so intertwined with projection that there was little, if any, separation between myth and reality.  In this sense, consciousness of the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods was a mythic consciousness."    He also addresses love, parenting, etc. such as his observation on page 185 that: "We could say that the mother is more instrumental in the development of a man's capacity to receive love, and the father is more instrumental in his capacity to give love."  For additional reading on unconscious forces, see: George Weinberg "Invisible Masters: Compulsions and the Fear that Drives Them" Plume NY 1993 and John A. Sanford "The Invisible Partners" Paulist Press NY 1980 
 Nancy Mitford came to me by way of this book and, ignorant of the incredible talents that lie with her, her sisters and the aristocratic family into which she was born. Since then, I have devoured Nancy's fiction, her personal history and I have much more to learn. However, it is her talents as a biographer and historian, perhaps best exemplified with this book, that I believe she achieves the realization of her greatest gift; that is to send life into the dead hand of history. In "The Sun King" history comes alive as I have truly never experienced. Here is a book that takes heretofore one dimensional characters and fills their frames with humanity, giving them dimemsionality, life. She uncovers the perspective that sheds light on each characters good and bad side, turning Louis XIV, Monsieur, The King's wives, his children, in fact the whole of the court at Versailles into a vision in one's head that makes it easy to understand why the Ancien Regime in France can still provide relevance to a contemporary world that approximates it so little. Relevance and topic interest, to be sure, is the most amazing feat for a historian to achieve. Nancy Mitford with "The Sun King" stands among rarified company in such an achievement 
 I had to write an essay on "Hamlet" in English class this year, and the Cliffsnotes helped me tremendously (considering that I hadn't even read the book, I wrote a pretty good essay with its help). Each scene is given a thorough explanation, and it has an index of themes and a tree of all the characters. Not only does it simplify the book, it also analyzes further and clears up any confusion about the plot. It helped me a lot, I recommend it highly 
 King Sunny Ade burst on the American scene much the way Marley did with his memorable Roxy concert, but unfortunately Ade has never been able to match the intensity of this performance in subsequent CD's.  This is African guitar and drums at their very best, a kinetic whirlwind of rhythms that is riveting to listen to.  Ade draws from a deep well of Nigerian music to put together a stellar concert that will sweep you off your feet. The music is chant-like, exhorting the audience to participate in the polyphony of sounds.  It is very hard to stay seated.  There is also a video of him and Ebenezer Obey for those who must see him to believe him 
 If you are picking and choosing which volumes to keep this is definitely one of them.  There's no denying that the second season of Classic Trek is the best one with many seminal and definitive episodes which basically make ST:TOS what it is.  "Amok Time" is probably among the top 5 ever episodes of TOS and rightfully so.  We get drama, suspense, humour and a surprise ending: all the ingredients that go into making the perfect episode.  The pacing of the scenes is also first class and all in all makes this a very memorable episode.  The first episode holds a lot of melodrama and is based upon an interesting premise: what if the ancient Greek gods we actually aliens?  The overall episode is average though but still worth getting on dvd.  Highly recommended 
 It is fair to say that "The Freud Reader" is the Freudian Bible...perfect for beginners and still useful for the scholarly.      This book is perfect for those of us who have never studied Freud at a tertiary level. It supplies the reader with the relevant background information on the life of Freud in an objective but interesting manner 
 I always manage to get my feet all tangled when I try to do line dancing and I get the timing all wrong. It is almost like a line up of dominos when I get in the dance line so I was determined to figure a few of them out. This DVD was fun to go through and helped me realize that the dances are not really that hard when they are broken down and that I COULD do them.  I am sure that if I had started out this way I would have avoided many awkward moments that I have gotten myself into. As such, I definitely recommend this DVD 
 I haven't opened and read a book in two nights for a long time.  This book will keep your attention from page 1 all the way through.  Get some eye drops before purchasing it.  You'll need them 
 This is where it's at, editing, cinematography and originality, everything a film maker could ever ask for, it's a text book in moving pictures, this is the film that changed film making as we know it, I love this film for all it's worth 
 At last, a book which attends to a growing number of women who have made probably the most important decision of their lives. I am one of them: After considerable thought, ongoing medical problems,lousy family experiences and observing other women, I have decided that I do not want to have children. Why do I have to go online to find a book which illustrates to me that I am not alone? This book is a beautifully written revelation. It highlights the many many reasons behind deciding to remain childless/childfree. Any woman who has experienced doubts about whether motherhood is what she wants should read this book - it will help her think through her own life. Thank you for this wonderful book. All shops in the UK and USA should stock it 
 I just want to add a five star rating to this album, this band! I think the other reviewers said quite enough about the brilliance of Meshuggah! Just go buy the damn album 
 This movie captures faithfully what is in my imagination when I read the book.  Even though it was made several years ago, it's still a fantastic movie.  Timeless 
 Stephanie Klein has exposed herself to the world without reservations of how anyone thinks or feels or `judges'.    This book not only relates to everybody, but it shows the pure rawness that we all think...yet sometimes don't have the courage to say it.  I found myself bursting out with laughter, because I can identify with her life experiences---even if we live totally different lifestyles.      Her honesty and humor is what really makes this book worth reading.  It's definitely a book I couldn't stop reading.    Thanks Stephanie!!!  You're a magnificent writer!  
 I haven't read many Oprah picks, but I am so glad I read this one. It's a murder-mysery intertwined with related events, past and present. As another reviewer said, this book has marvelous pacing and I totally agree with that. You get deeper and deeper into the story as it goes along and I could never second-guess this book, either! All I can say is Wow! So glad I read it!! Along with this one, I also recommend "Any Man". 
 I'm not usually a big book guy, but I knew I had to read my boy "Cali's" first book. We play ball together at the Prospect YMCA. So I went and bought a copy to show my support. Then I didn;t read it for about six months. Well I just finished it last night. I couldn't believe how good it was. This dude can really write. And I love the story. It's sad, but in the end you feel like the main character is going to be alright. Speaking of the main character. He's from the west coast which usually means he'd be soft, but this kid has got some heart. so get get a copy of this book and support my boy Cali. You'll be happy you did 
 Larissa Moss is a clear thought leader in the Business Intelligence field, and this book only underscores that appelation. If you are implementing a business intelligence program, or even just thinking about, this book will give a clear roadmap for understanding what to do to build a successful prgram 
 One can tell just by watching the films of directors such as Coppola, Scorcese, Friedkin and all the others that made up the New Hollywood of the 1970's, that they were infused with a streak of arrogance. Many films that were full of pretence and repulsive characters, but that nevertheless embodied a new spirit of American auterism, brought about by a new found European sensibility and a shift in power from producers to directors. So its no surprise that Peter Biskind's detailed and intriguing read, reveals these directors to be monstrous human beings.  Power hungry, tin pot dictators fuelled by drugs, alcohol and sex. Somehow despite the lines of coke and the absurd sums of money that went  flowing around, some of the greatest films in American cinema appeared. Biskind's enthusiasm for this period comes across and it helps that he lived through it and his book is filled with a great deal of insightful social commentary, his reading of STAR WARS for example is quite interesting. However he does tend to overcook the political and allegorical side of his critique. At times the book becomes a bit too gossipy and academics and film students might be put off by the tales of back stabbing and drug abuse. But, this does give the book a spark, which separates it from the more impenetrable and theory based books on the same subject. It is precisely because of Biskind's talky and down to earth prose that makes the book such a joy. There is a great deal of value to this book and after reading it you cannot view the films of this period in quite the same way. Enjoyable from start to finish 
 David McCullough tells the story of one of the most horrendous floods to occur in the US history in his forthright book, THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD.   In his eloquent style of prose that reads like a novel, McCullough tells the unfortunate tale of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a small mill and fishing town, which was hit on May 30, 1889, Memorial Day.  Six to eight inches of rain fell on this small working class town, which was comprised of a microcosm of ethnicities who emigrated from Europe and the United Kingdom as well as a few Negroes.    McCullough provides detailed information about the flood that killed 2,000 people.  The tremendous rainfall destroyed the local dam, and as a result families and individuals were swept by the floodwaters.  He vividly describes the residents who attempted to escape, and were fortunate to survive as well as those who perished in the process. Within his narrative he offers the voices of those who recounted that fateful day.  At the end of the book, McCullough respectively lists the thousands of names of people who perished, and presumably were victims of the event.  This may be the most heart wrenching aspects of the book in addition to McCullough's narrative.  McCullough intertwines events that shaped history.  He stresses the significance of technological advancements that occurred during the last part of the nineteenth century, such as, the telegraph, the telephone, and the presence of the steel industry; through eyewitness accounts and archival material, McCullough reveals the irony of the event, which was linked to the construction of the dam, and the heed of warnings that were ignored.  In the aftermath of the flood, it was shameful to read how national and local newspapers treated the event - "staged" photo opportunities and inconsistencies with the facts.  THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD is an unforgettable story.  For those who enrich their minds with events of the past, history offers its lessons.  Indeed, this is a story where one will read and understand how Johnstown, Pennsylvania has a place in American history.    
 Although this book was somewhat predictable and Ms. Coel seemed to be on her soap box environmentally, I still enjoyed the story.  The mystery part of the book was exciting enough, and I still really like Father John.  The book is about a large energy company wanting to put a nuclear waste dump site right smack in the middle of Wind River Reservation.  Despite all the jobs that this site would yield, Vicky Holden cannot go along with the idea, and she publishes her viewpoints in the local papers as well as at local meetings.  Then there is the old cowboy that Father John finds murdered in an abandoned cabin.  Do these two things have something in common?  Before Vicky and Father John find out, more murders occur on their Reservation.  What makes these books so special are Coel's characters.  They are very real and very well-drawn.  This is a very good series 
   I look forward every year to the annual edition of this series and its competitor, Best American Science Writing. Since there are way too many good magazines published I gave up long ago trying to keep up with them, and this book/series serves two useful functions. First, it provides a delightful sampler of science-related writing of the past year, and, second, it often introduces me to some new writers. It is the kind of book that has repercussions: I have never failed to follow up by buying additional books, either books by the authors represented or books referred to in the selections (WARNING: This book could be dangerous to your budget!)  The series editor provides a certain stability and may ensure some breadth to the selections, but each volume bears the stamp of the interests of the guest editor. This year there were an unusual number of writers that I do not normally associate with science, such as Malcolm Gladwell, but the ideas were still stimulating. Dining with Robots was so much fun that I  e-mailed a number of people the reference and provoked quite a discussion. That is the kind of writing I enjoy! This was probably not the best of the series, but it nonetheless was not one I would want to miss.   
 They say, in order to do a story justice, a writer should write what he/she knows. Obviously, author Edd Voss speaks from the heart. For a short story `Welcome Home' speaks volumes!  If anyone reading `Welcome Home' recognizes themselves as one of those 'Americans' responsible for making men like Jim, who served in Nam, feel such sorrow, then you should be the one to hang your head in shame.  God bless our vets, and God speed the soldiers fighting overseas now.. 
 I live downtown and have to walk my dogs everyday, so I thought some stylish rainboots would make rainy walks more fun.  The color was not very accurate from the website picture - much more yellow than brown, but they're still cute.  The only complaint I have about them is that the insole tends to slide around when you walk, which is kind of annoying 
 Remember those dreadful years spent in school. Dull subjects, dull teachers, dull students, it was a test just to get through the system. Contrast this with learning to do something like "Flight Simulator."  Or look how fast the kids pick up the new, rather complex game.   "Formal" education began with a teacher taking a handful students to instruct on the way of the world. This has grown to the couple of hundred students in a lecture hall being instructed by a TA. This is "progress?" I'd rather be in Professor Snape's potients class.   The use of the computer through interactive techniques of simulations, games or whatever you choose to call them can take us back to the past with one intelligence working with one student.   But can you imagine what the teachers union will say.   This book analyzes the techniques that the gaming people use to teach people how to play the game. When you think about it, that's not terribly different from teaching people how to drive a tank. And it becomes a self-fullfilling thing, "Join the Army and you can drive a real tank."   I believe that this book points the way that education has to go 
 This little book was an interesting read, however, it should be taken with a grain of salt. One of the fifty things you're not supposed to know is that 10,000 people die from legal drugs every year. I would have prefered a follow up that explains 13,000 die because they can not get access to treatments that could save their lives because the FDA said "no, not until it is approved." All in all it is a good coffee table book 
 Overall I thought the book was good.  It starts at the basics, explaining aperature, film speed, etc.  A good overview of all the different types of photography (landscape, portraits, etc) is also included.  The only complaint I have is the book is a little dated.  The majority of the book covers film cameras, with only a small section on digital cameras.  However, I just bought my first Digital SLR and many of the features it has are just like the older film cameras the book describes.  So, it was still relevant 
 Bonds are popularly viewed as boring and conservative, offering little in the way of returns and appealing to institutions more than individuals: not so say the authors, who explain bonds and why they deserve a place in every  investor's portfolio. From different types of bonds to their values, The  Bond Bible provides an excellent coverage 
 Caddie Woodlawn is a hyper pre-teen, 10, who is a tom-boy and loves to do unlady-like things. The great and unbeilievable thing about this book is true. Normally the girls back then were very proper. This is a great book and  i highly encourage people to read it. This book was  better than Caddie Woodlawn 
 It's surprising to me that a band that played this long and extensively left only 21 recordings, and that no reissue existed until now.  Excellent audio restoration.  Painstaking research in the accompanying booklet.  This disc is a "must-have" for collectors and fans of early dance band music 
 "Satellites" was originally released as a single in Europe shortly after the album's release in 2005.  It finally found a home in the states with Robbins Entertainment, the label responsible for bringing us Ian Van Dahl, Lasgo, and Reina.  I am glad this union came to fruition, because the import single for this song contained fairly uninteresting mixes.  The "US" mix is fairly faithful to the original with a few poppy quirks.  The "Extended" (which is less than 5 minutes long, a crappy extended mix) is alright, but it's just the album version with a bit of length.  The Electro mix is fun, but a tad boring.  The Club Junkies provide the first interesting remix, giving us a Euro-styled club trance mix.  Not amazing, but pretty good.  Clubstar provide us with a more aggressive mix reminiscent of Cascada with the pounding beats, although I'm not overly fond of it.  It's got a nice piano melody though.  Flip N' Fill provide something I'm sure most aren't used to from them.  Their mix is not nearly as fast as some of their other mixes.  Pretty fun!  The winner here though, is the Dancing DJs mix.  Full on trance with Petra's AMAZING vocals, a big stadium sound, and a fantastic beat.  This remix really is not to be missed!  All in all this is a fantastic introduction to September.  I hope to see more of them in the future, and DEFINITELY check out the album, In Orbit 
 I found an original edition of The Red Napoleon at a used bookstore. Very interesting when looked at as an alternative history, but when it was written it was meant as warning of what might happen. Included excellent maps and orders of battle for the American and Red forces. Very rousing and descriptive scenes of war (especially the Battle for New York City) but racial paranoia keeps this from being a classic 
 Bill Buford's mid-life crisis is our gift. Unleashed from his day job at a desk at the New Yorker, where he was the unsung fiction editor for years (I actually spoke to him once; he was very nice when he rejected my short story), Buford has come into his own, as well as his own voice,  and found his passion, his true calling. HEAT is delicious from start to finish, and I was very sad (and hungry) when it did.  Only a couple of nits to pick: I would have liked to have heard a bit more about his personal life and the logistics. To wit, how could he afford to not work for so long? He mentions his wife's fancy (well-paying) magazine job. But is that really enough to support a whole family (they have two sons) living in one of the most expensive cities in the world, Manhattan? Also, what about his kids? If I recall correctly, they are never mentioned in the manuscript, not one time. That's a curious omission. What toll did Buford's food fancies take on la familia? I think exploring that aspect of following one's bliss would have really helped to ground and improve the book and, as Dr. Phil would say, keep it real. As real as all those four-legged creatures Buford learned how to expertly butcher. Doing one thing means giving up another. What sacrifices did Buford and the Buford family have to make to enable his numerous international sojourns? It was obviously worth it, and Buford never really lost his old day job. He now writes for the New Yorker. Not many of us have that kind of job security. All in all, nicely done, Bill.      
 I read the Material World several years ago and I was excited to see that Peter and Faith had published a "sequel" of sorts for the book.  Women in the Material World is fascinating, especially if you can review it side by side to the Material World.  I thought the questions regarding love in their marriage and their expectations for their children were so interesting.  I am very happy with my purchase of this book and I recommend it to anyone who is considering it 
 I was amazed at how easy to read this book was. I fully expected a dry tomb of factual anecdotes, however I was pleasantly surprised to find an easy and interesting read. Darwin's style of writing is extremely persuasive and thorough; it is easy to understand how this book took the world by storm through it's many supportive examples. In this day and age, it is still relevant and is not obviously dated, no mean feat for a science book written in 1859 before a lot of major discoveries.  [...] The only negative about this particular issue is that the print is extremely small and closely set, which for some readers may indicate that a different edition would be preferable.  
 I love this book.  It brings such a calming sense of being just by picking it up 
 This is a must for any fan of Proust--you get to see not only what the originals for his most memorable characters (the Ducehsse de Guermantes, Swann, Charlus, Mme. verdurin) looked like, but also the interior of one of the great fin-de-siecle chateaus where one couple (the Prince and Princess Radziwell) lived. The Nadar photographs are sharp, startling and magnificent. I've wanted a book like this for years 
 If you enjoy baseball, you will enjoy this book. Written from a unique perspective 
 I highly recommend this book! Tommy Nelson has taken the book of Ecclesiastes & made it relevant to our lives in today's world... An excellent Bible study for the young & old. You will not be disappointed with purchasing this book 
 "These exercises will give you new information about yourself. You will be able to make new choices. If you are willing, then you can definitely create the kind of life you say you want." ~Louse L. Hay  Louise delves into health, fears, phobias, sex, self-esteem, money, friendship, addictions, work and intimacy issues. In her loving, caring way, she guides you through fifteen work"fun" chapters. I think this book is more fun than work. You will learn about:   1. Basic Techniques - Changing thoughts and releasing old beliefs about yourself.  2. Who Are You? What Do You Believe?  3. Health Checklist 4. Feeling Good 5. Fears and Phobias 6. Anger 7. Criticism and Judgment 8. Addictions 9. Forgiveness 10. Work 11. Money and Prosperity 12. Friends 13. Sexuality 14. Love and Intimacy 15. Your New Picture  You will find questions like: "What do you want that you are not having?" At the end of the first chapter there is a "Deservability Treatment" where you can read affirmations and perhaps extract one or two sentences for daily reflection like: "I am willing to create new thoughts about myself and about my life. My new thinking becomes new experiences."   There are many places where you can record your own thoughts about various topics like love, sex, work, money, success, failure and God. There is a place to write a story of your life and to draw a picture of your inner child.   The chapter on health might jumpstart a new healthy journey into nutrition and wellness.   If you want to pass this book along to a friend, you could also buy a small journal and make notes in the journal instead of on the pages. This book could also be used as inspiration for journal writing. This book gave me a great idea - to create an entire book just of affirmations. A lot of our self-talk can make us miserable or enlightened.   Louise L. Hay also focuses on reflection, meditation, visualization and relaxation. She presents a pathway to a more positive and fulfilling life that is filled with daily discoveries of beauty and nurturing elements. It is time to start loving ourselves more and time to heal our lives.   "Criticism breaks down the inner spirit, and never changes a thing. Praise builds up the spirit and can bring positive changes." ~Louise L. Hay  ~TheRebeccaReview.com  
 Roald Amundsen's "The South Pole" is a detailed, even exhaustive account of his successful 1910-1912 expedition to the South Pole.  Amundsen's expedition was the first to reach the South Pole, after failures by other expeditions.    Amundsen was relentlessly methodical and practical in planning and executing the expedition.  He identified a practical method of travel for the long haul to the South Pole from the Antarctic coast: dog sleds and skiis.  He and his crew experimented and tested all their equipment and supplies in the  Antarctic while patiently waiting for the right weather to travel.  In striking contrast to his British competitor, Robert Falcon Scott, Amundsen correctly estimated the amount of food that would be consumed by physically active men operating for weeks in sub-zero temperatures.  Amundsen's preparation is so complete that the actual expedition sometimes has all the drama of a weekend fishing trip.  Amundsen was apparently a modest man, and it falls to Roland Huntford in an introduction to draw the obvious comparison with the catastrophic failure of the Scott expedition.  Amundsen's account provides all the detail necessary for anyone who might wish to duplicate his feat.  Unfortunately, his writing style is very dry and even dedicated students of polar exploration may find finishing this book a long haul.  This book is highly recommended to students of the history of polar travel 
  Not as funny as some books, but funny enough to keep me smiling.  Not as many plot twists as a Harry Potter book, but quite a few.  Not quite a thriller like a Davinci Code or a Grisham book, but exciting enough to keep you up at night turning pages.  A little inane, but not so much that the reader loses interest.   The budding entomologist will be thrilled to see the scientific names entered for bugs who make cameo appearances - in this regard, the author appears as tongue-in-cheek naive as his conscientious hero.    This book might make a good movie for the likes of Steve Martin, Jim Carrey, Jack Black, Napoleon Dynamite, or __________(plug in your favorite comedian).  It helps if you still have a little nostalgia for those youthful years when silly things were funny.  In any event, I passed this book on to a group of teen-agers who read only cliff notes for their school assignments in the classics.  They devoured this book cover to cover and wouldn't quit laughing about it.  That by itself is worth 5 stars 
 From the first I found the book to be filled with good information. Most business books put me to sleep, but this one kept me turning pages, a nice change.  Why the change? because it offered great insight and ideas that get my creative mind flowing and showed me what great ventures are easily with in my reach.   Don't get me wrong, I've done my share of host beneficiaries and joint venture deals in the past, but I have never thought them though as the author suggests and outlines. The anthers JV outline is really a great way to work your way though the process from  deciding on a partner to the final ending of the deal. All in all a great resource.   My suggestion is that if you have been thinking about getting a few deals going but are waiting to learn more, then wait no more. This book will put you on a solid footing to really go for it. And if you have done deals in the past and are wondering how to get better at the art then again this book is a great resource even for those with some kills under their belt.   On a bottom line note, for me business book boils down to this: Did the book help me to make money? So far it has not but I have only had it a few days. But the points are so clear and understandable that I'm going to look up past Host Ben partners and JV partners just to see if we can get the ball rolling again but this time even better and with even more profit. So yes I can easily predict that this book will help me make more money and profit in my business.   With that stated this book is all in all one of the best real world business books I've read in a while. It is a business builder and asset.   One last comment. The book is written with minorities in mind. Don't let that fool you even if you are Joe Average Every Man. The information will work for any business and any person. 
 This is my favorite of the Lovecraft anthologies. I enjoyed the interaction between the stories of Bloch, Lovecraft, and Leiber. It is great to see how writers have bloomed stories from the works of previous authors. With Stephen King adding a story to the mix, this book is a must for Lovecraft fans. 
 How often does Keats get dragged out to do the bidding of some review--and yet it is difficult to imagine many books that would get closer to his advice to "load every rift with ore" than Simone Muench's Lampblack and Ash.  It isn't enough to say that Muench hears the music of the line, without acknowledging how she sees the visual music inside each word and the strumming of letter to letter. Her poems are at once, spare and ornate, rich and stark.  These poems are muscular, gorgeous and perfectly composed 
 of course, 20/20 hindsight is always nice in cases like this, but, i was a huge supporter of this film when it was still 'against the country' to do so...i reviewed it back then for 'another' publication, and, of course, as we know, many people lost their jobs over such a 'treasonous act'...(fortunately, i was not one of them...)...  but time has revealed to (almost) all that the bush administration lied from the get-go and has been lying ever since...  and contrary to one or two stragglers who still think bush won florida...KNOCK IT OFF!!!!!!...when the 'so-called' recount was done, it never took into account all the 'illegal' butterfly ballots that had candidates names on both sides of the ballot (which is againast florida state law), causing many to vote for pat buchanan by accident...(no to mention the disinfranchised democrats who weren't allowed to vote due to republican strong-arming...)  and, the sad fact that, by now, that i would still have to tell anyone left in america about the wicked ways of this administration, just goes to prove that some, no matter how much truth is placed before them, will still ignore common sense and follow the path that leads to their own destruction...  next time, this country better not wait for the 'bell curve' to catch up with those who already know.. 
 I would read this to a class or child and then enjoy listening to the work. It's a very nice introduction to Haydn and the humor he used when composing.  Wonderful book and it comes with a nice performance of several of Haydn's Symphonys 
 ?Girls don?t need school.?  This is the initial tone for Virgie Goes to School with Us Boys in the beginning.  This book is honest with its stereotypes and use of language (considering the time it is set in), yet liberal in it?s moral.   This book is sharp in its interpretation of how life was immediately following slavery, yet daring enough to portray life honestly and frank.  The illustrations are vivid and clear allowing the reader to perceive Virgie?s(the main character)exact environment.  As you read the book, the pictures draw you into the story as if you are another sibling for one of her brothers to pick on.  The emotions on each character?s faces are clear as if you can read their minds.  The watercolors bring the characters to life right before your eyes and portray life as realistic as a picture.  Any child would get lost in the beautiful art in these illustrations, as well as learn a little something about the importance of learning 
 Looking for a business book to read that might help me teach my staff more about great customer service I picked up Tattoo at the DFW airport on a recent business trip to Chicago. I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of the message Ms. Turner communicates in her book. The title and the cover are what initially drew me to investigate the books content. When I discovered that it was all about branding, marketing and customer service, I was intrigued to say the least. I was able to read the entire book on the flight to Chicago. One of the great things about the book was that there were pages to take notes at the end of each chapter, which made it easier for me to remember key points that I wanted to share with my staff. Turner writes about the concept of "advocate marketing" and gives examples of national and local small businesses that have been able to implement customer service that builds consumers that advocate for them on their behalf. Getting your customers to bring business to you by providing them with such great customer service that they not only tell their friends, but they insist that they try your product or patronize your establishment . . . what a concept 
 I thought that Loose Ends really topped themselves with this album!  Their funkiest one to date, as Watching You just kicks the album off with a bang with its heavy beats!  There's No Gratitude continues the funk vibe,  before the three song The Real Chuckeeboo suite that includes the funky Mr. Bachelor in the middle!  One other song I like is Life, which has such a driving groove within it.  This was the last album with the original lineup, but they definitely showed their best on this album and kicked up the funk a notch! Carl McIntosh just had the funk in him on this album, before continuing with other members on the next album in '90. This album was just as funky as Bobby Brown's album in the same year of 1988!  Musical, melodic, beat heavy and funky at the same time too!    
 With all of the modern movies depicting the horrors and glory of ancient or medieval warfare and battle--like BraveHeart, Gladiator, Alexander, The Kingdom of Heaven and even the Lord of the Rings to some extent--Hanson's book covers all the bases. It isn't that he has his students playing "paintball" warfare with aluminum foil swords and shields on the campus lawn--it's more that he was and is trying to make the feeling and reality of warfare more tangible and understandable for those of us who study or are interested in ancient war. His descriptions of battle make your skin tingle, just like you might feel when watching a battle scene in a movie. He is just adept at doing the same with words and without the fancy feathered costumes. The Western Way of War takes you inside the hoplite phalanx and Victor gives you a bird's eye view of what the ancients must have seen and felt at the moments before, during and after the battles. 
 I'm not sure why more classic rock listeners and Dead-heads don't focus on the extraordinary music on this release.  It features two complete shows, each minus one song, from Landover, MN in 1976 and Syracuse, NY 1976.   Some purists dislike the prominence of Keith's electronic and accoustic pianos and Donna Jean's occasionally off-pitch wailing.  In truth, discs 3 and 4 are worth the full price of the set. They are phenomenally recorded from 2-track analog soundboard tapes. The pace of the 21 songs is flawless and the jams are earthy and creative.    By comparison, the MD set on discs 1 and 2 is slightly weaker, with disc 1 holding dominance and disc 2 stumbling because of some jams that are downright annoying.   At four discs for $6 each, this is one of the best historical and aural documents of this wonderful, joyous band.  Disc 3, in particular, is a standout, with 10 Dead standards in rare form and fine sound.   I've read the many posts of those who find #23 (in this issue) to be far superior to these recordings, but for the life of me, I can't figure it out.  These are sad and grievous times. A good Dead album can help the most fearful and sad break through and feel happy.  The performances of Cold Rain and Snow, Big River, Friend of the Devil, Playing in the Band, Comes a Time -- all rival other live recordings I've heard.  A real bargain, a comfort, and 1-1 /2 outstanding and classic rock concerts. Go for it.  Rhino's quality-control adds to the value.  And the price has dropped considerably, too 
 I was recently in London to hear Dr. Diamond speak and was astonished at the literary intelligence of the English. They really loved this book! I think it's such an important work, and wish that every student of literature could look at the classics in the way Dr. Diamond looks at them- for their life energy raising properties.   Blake is always beautiful, and more profoundly so in the style Diamond has laid his words out. 
 I ordered two of these shirts for my 17 month old twins.  They absolutely love the shirts, as they love the Wiggles.  The shirts are excellent quality - a heavier quality cotton 
 I am of two minds about this book.  First, I hated to come to the end, as with most Bryson books.  It's like traveling with someone who amuses you a great deal and whom you will miss when you part ways.  On the other hand, I was often clueless about where he was (no, I did not bother to consult a map).  Athough he provides a short glossary, there were many unfamiliar terms to this California guy.  There are certainly recuyrring themes, to say the least.  There might be room for an abridged version of this book for people outside the U.K.  But I would buy the unabridged version because I would not want to miss a great turn of phrase, even at the cost of listening to more whining about bad hotels.  And what's with the binge drinking?  Why didn't his wife accompany him to ANY of the cities?  I propose that she write "What I do while Bill is gone on his trips. 
 They got it down. It's a sixteen week course, providing you are up to speed with the preliminary 11 week training program.(That's the ablility to jog 30 minutes - 4 times a week) I am on my last long run this weekend of week#13 at 18 miles (the first long run was 5 in week 1)and then the last 3 weeks before the marathon is all tapering back. I am confident, and have not a doubt that I am, by this time, a marathoner, and will finish. That is the goal emphasized by the book, and that will be fine by me ...(this time..)! 
 I don't know what some of these other reviews are talking about, frankly.  This book highlights Barry at his best, hilarious as usual.  The more you know about politics, the funnier this stuff gets.  Barry is a highly intelligent commentator on politics and on the sometimes insane world of campaigning and lawmaking.  His new-and-improved version of the Constitution is roll-on-the-floor laughing material.  Barry also discusses the 2000 presidential candidates, making light of their shortcomings, but also getting serious: he met both of them, and says that Gore was much more personable than he seemed on TV, and Bush much more intelligent.  He's on to an important point here: the way candidates appear on TV, or the ways they are sterotyped by the media, doesn't necessarily have anything to do with who they are in real life.  A must-have for anyone who likes politics, and actually has a sense of humor 
 Stormy Weather was the first Hiaasen novel I read. I picked up a paperback copy at a remainder sale. Never heard the name of the guy and didn't expect much; but it was cheap, and so...  Boy, was I wrong! Since then I have made sure that I read every Hiaasen in and out of print, and I'm about to catch up on some of his real old stuff. His writings opened up the world of the writers and the universe of that nook of America called 'Florida', which is about as whacky and demented as it comes. Actually, I've _been_ to Florida, though not down to the Keys; but it's amazing what you miss when you basically just pass through or dip in and out of it. No wonder Piers Anthony used it as the setting for a bunch his, firmly tongue-in-cheek, fantasy novels.   Stormy Weather, to get back to the subject, piled on charcaters I'll never be likely to forget, from the skull-juggling Augustine to the simply impossible 'Skink'. A never-ending litany of ascerbically presented character sketches and Hiaasen's usual--entirely justified!--tirade and caricature of venal politicians, environmental rape and greed; plus some truly and honestly _stupid_ people.  Fun and games and I never looked back. There are other 'Florida' writers I've come to like, especially James Hall and Laurence Shames. Depending on my mood, I sometimes like them better than Hiaasen, especially Laurence Shames. All three of them offer different perspectives on life in and beyond that strange place called 'Florida'. As I said, it depends on my mood. Hiaasen usually ends up at the top when I'm in a 'South Park' disposition; needing satire with heart. And I need some more of that now and soon and please!

 I read some of the negative reviews on here and I just laughed at how naive some people are. They call this a racist movie, it is horrible, and spike shouldn't make movies anymore. But if these people open their eyes, they will realize that all of the negative comments and actions in the movie really happen. It is true on both sides black and white. The movie was made to expose how we are as a people in general and to expose the ignorance that different races have about each other. Not only does the movie address race but it also addresses drug problems in the community as well as issues that affect families. But I guess some people are too narrow minded to catch that. Anyway this is a classic Spike Lee film with great cinematography, good script, and an awesome cast. Definitely a dvd for your collectio 
 This is how I'd like to think the heavenly angels are watching over us.  This novel gives examples of how angels watch over and guide us without super-imposing God's will.  On the other hand, demons get right into our heads and experience extreme joy over the confusion they cause when we lose sight of our faith.  Although I would have liked to have experienced more emotion-filled moments during the read, I absolutely couldn't wait to find out how good-beats-evil.  A thought-provoking story that will leave you wondering... 
 This book is amazing. I am a novice swimmer who falls at the very beginning of Hines' workout zones. I read the first half of the book in an hour, copied one of his FIRST workouts onto a sheet of paper, stuck it into a plastic sheet protector and headed off to the pool. My freestyle was a mess. I couldn't swim more than three lengths without my arms burning, my legs turning to rubber, etc. Now, i have shaved 4 strokes off one length and can get to the other side without feeling like I'm on my death throes. I never thought fitness books worked until I read this book. I'm a slightly overweight, slightly out of shape person who has never really been athletic and just quit smoking. But now, I go to the pool almost every day (after all, I'm only 20!!) and I can't WAIT to start out a new workout in Hines' book. I feel more confident, more in shape and more athletic.  10/10!!! 
 A lot of ink has been spilled over Iraq during the past four years, and for good reason.  With any subject so controversial and contested, there will obviously be a lot of polemical and harmful writing from both sides of the argument, but thankfully, a lot of well-informed and intelligent writing as well.  With so much out there, sifting through it all can be demanding, but anyone that comes across The Assassins' Gate will have in their hands one of the true gems on the subject.  If you are only going to read one book on what is currently happening in Iraq, I passionately believe that this should be the book.  It's hard to tell exactly what you're going to get just by looking at the title and what's on the back cover, but I can assure you that all of the comments on the back (made by some of the most respected foreign policy critics) are dead on in their assessment.  What you'll find in this book is the story of how the U.S. (again) found itself in Iraq.  The beginning chapters foucs on the decision making process; who was making them and how.  This is perhaps the most well-written and intelligent description of these events, and I have read more than several of them.  You will gain more insight on how we got into this war from reading Packer's book than from perhaps anywhere else.  He gives the reader wonderful character sketches of people like Paul Wolfowitz, Robert Kagan, and Kanan Makiya.  These are the people that really had a large hand in what was happening, and by focusing on them rather than the bigger names like Bush or Rumsfeld, Packer does a much better job at explaining these events than his peers.  The rest of the book deals with Packer's personal experiences in Iraq during the war.  Each chapter deals with a different theme, such as the insurgency & the potential for a civil war, and while the scope of what's covered in the bulk of the book is somewhat more narrow than the first three or four chapters, Packer still gives the reader a very satisfying account of the war as a whole.  This book's biggest strenght is that it blends nearly flawless political analysis with the readability of a novel.  Packer is a superb writer and I found it very hard to put this book down.  From an academic point of view the book is close to flawless.  This in itself is very impressive, because it does not appear that Packer had much previous experience with Iraq.  I've read the works of those considered to be area experts and some of them can't even hold a match to Packer's work here.  This is exciting and depressing all at once.  I found this book to be particularly good because it also fit perfectly with my own personal feelings about the war.  As someone that wanted to see Hussein gone, I had to support the idea of removing him (and still do).  But beyond that initial decision, the way the Bush administration handled the war has been negligent at best, criminal at worst.  Packer has not written a polemical rant here, but by the end of his book, he lets you know that very real and harmful mistakes have been made.  He occupies that well-intentioned, but pragmatic middle ground that this debate so sorely needs.  This book will appeal to casual observers and serious analysts alike.  While books by Diamond and Feldman that cover similar themes are also excellent and should be read, Packer's book is by far the best, and I believe that no one can claim to truly have a grasp on what's happening in Iraq unless they have read this book.  We can only hope that Packer will continue to produce work of such extraordinarily high quality on this and other foreign policy issues 
 With the gigantic success of "The Mummy", Universal Studios and director Stephen Sommers believed that they had a budding franchise on their hands.  With both the movie studio and the director wishing to see this possible franchise come to fruition, little time was wasted in getting Stephen Sommers busy at work on crafting the sequel.  With a bigger budget, an already established backstory for most of the characters, and the entire cast returning, things were definitely looking good for an even bigger box office return for this sequel.  Set in 1933, "The Mummy Returns" takes place approximately 10 years after the events of "The Mummy".  Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) are now married and have a young son named Alex.  After a devasting chain of events leads to the resurrection of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) in London, before they realize what's going on Rick and Evie find themselves in a fight against an army of mummies, and their son ends up getting kidnapped by Imhotep.  Now that Imhotep once again walks the Earth, determined to fulfill his quest for immortality, another force has been loosed upon the world... one born of the darkest rituals of ancient Egyptian mysticism, and even more powerful than Imhotep.  With the fate of the world in the balance, Rick and Evie must race against time to save not only the world but also rescue their son from Imhotep before it's too late.  As I stated earlier, this film received an even bigger budget, and had the fortune of getting the entire cast back together, "The Mummy Returns" succeeds in being even bigger, more extravagant, and better than the original film.  With the backstory for the majority of the characters out of the way in "The Mummy", director/writer Stephen Sommers was allowed more freedom in exploring more of the world of this franchise without having to get bogged down on origins.  An interesting segment in the movie happens at the beginning of the film when WWE's Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson makes an appearance as 'The Scorpion King' (the public liked the character so much that Universal spawned him off into his own feature film) in an epic battle that is awesome to watch.  The special effects provided by ILM are once again top-notch, all except for the final sequence with a digital hybrid of 'The Rock' and a CGI scorpion, this scene looked a bit weak on screen.  However, it's forgiveable since this would be an extremely difficult sequence to create, and with that ILM still manages to make the scene appear decent.  The only other complaint I have regarding this movie would have to be that the movie seemed to focus a little too much on the 8-year old son Alex, his character is way too annoying and he's always present since he is partly responsible for the events in this movie.  Aside from those complaints the rest of the movie is really enjoyable, and a very strong sequel to "The Mummy".    I strongly recommend seeing this movie, but to fully enjoy the movie make sure you have seen the original film first.  "The Mummy Returns" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality 
 If you aren't sure about buying this Dictonary, I would really recommend it because it is very good. It has excellent German-English translations as well as English-German. 
 Don't Tempt Me represents a commentary on the value of the structure of morality. Essentially, the film revolves around the competition between Heaven and Hell for mortal souls in the beginning but about mid-way through the film we begin to see that the key moral conflict of the modern era is not between good and evil, but between morality and amorality. 	The co-operation between the minions of Heaven and Hell to throw the soul of Manny the boxer to heaven is in order to prevent Heaven from shutting down and thus empowering the managerial cabal in Hell to seize power from the general manager of Hell, a traditionalist concerned with the maintenance of Hell as a place of punishment, demonstrates this conflict. This cabal is not evil in the conventional sense, nor is it good. It does not concern itself with these categories at all, and it is this which is truly radical about their movement. They seek not to be good or evil but efficient. They disregard the categories in totality and in so doing seek to dismantle the very framework of good and evil which underlies the concepts and allows them to make sense at all.  	This representation of true `evil', if such a term can successfully be applied to them, is implicitly a commentary on the globalization and corporatization which represents such a powerful force in today's world. The film indicts the pursuit of profits as an end in itself free of moral judgement as an existential threat to the very concepts of good and evil, represented as the general managers of Heaven and Hell. The outcome of this, then, would be the elimination of heaven and the breakdown of Hell as a place of penance and atonement and its replacement with a Hell in which the totality is operated for the benefit of the managerial class, which is to say the shareholders of multi-national enterprises. The symbol of this subversion of the mission of the whole into the service of the few is air-conditioning the general offices of Hell. 	 The depiction of the management of the Supermercado can be seen as playing a similar role on Earth to the Cabal in hell - they care for profits and do whatever maximizes them, without considering or acknowledging the moral dimension which their decisions touch on.  	The central conflict is then solved by the affirmation of the role of morality with Manny's ascension to heaven, but such a resolution is incomplete. As the General Manager of Heaven says early in the film, even those reaching heaven these days aren't reaching it of their own merit, and the same can be said of Manny - Hell throws the contest in Heaven's favor, a fixed fight, which seems to indicate that the corporatization of morality as a process is not so easily halted. The incomplete and essentially unsatisfactory temporary solution mirrors the uneasy relationships between multi-nationals and globalization on the one hand and the concept of social justice and corporate morality on the other in our present world and demonstrates the ambiguity of the solution. 	I think the film succeeds as a critique as well as an entertaining film and operates on both levels with finesse and skill. The layers work together to inform the viewing of the film and make it more enjoyable 
 I love this book. I just picked it up one day about 10 years ago in a book store after reading the book title. After a 30 minute read I bought it. This book must be put in context with the complete works of Miller. The ugly passages of hate exist for a reason. I feel they are not always in reference to himself directly. There is so much beauty in the passages of this book. All this becomes clear once you read his other books. I mean we are talking about a man on the verge of spiritual collapse trying to begin a love affair with writing at a rather late age. But once he really feels the passion of life again after Paris you see in his books a dramatic difference. The Rosy Crucifixtion series is an example. Lots more character and story development take place after life starts to make sense again for Miller. Not that he had anything completely figured out in life, but I would say he is in love with living like never before at this point. The main reason I post this is to suggest reading other Miller books before making a final verdict on this most subversive title. Either way I love this writer. His passages can be some of the most beautiful ever written at times. Other times he takes up blocks of space to describe small events rather generically, pointing us to the beauty of simple everyday living done with a patient heart and   a passionate eye. Check out Plexus if you have the chance.   
 I've read a whole bunch of other books from last summer to now, most of which I thought were very good. But I still love the stories Diana Wynne Jones has writen. I'm reread her Chrestomanci Quartet again and am looking for some further writings by Jones. She is all in all one of my favorite authors. I liked 'Enna Hittims'. A must for any death hard fan of Jones 
 At 47 years of age I wondered if I'd find this book that I was so fond of when I was in 1st grade.  Now, with a first grader of my own, I was delighted to find this wonderful book still in print.  Our daughter has enjoyed it as much as I did when I was her age.  It's a great story with lot's of laughs.  If you have a K-grader or 1st grader you will not be dissapointed with the laughs and giggles this book brings 
 Great book.  Very useful for new collectors 
 Fiction has the ability to transport a reader into the world of the author's choosing. The best fiction enhances the reader's ability to deal with reality.  The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency Series, of which this volume is the eighth installment, brings the reader to Botswana--an African nation struggling to maintain its identity as it adopts modern ways--and shows the power to be had in moral living, in trying to do good and be good.  No reader can or will regret time spent in Mma Ramotswe's world.  The author's love of Africa pervades his stories.  His characters are good people who deal with their circumstances and foibles in an honest and forthright manner so lacking in more "modern" cultures and settings. Africa seems to have retained habits of polite respect, habits now rarely found in this Californian's world.  By this eighth volume we have come to know and respect Mma Ramotswe as a person with a singular gift of insight.  By now we have seen her deal with numerous difficulties and the author is concentrating on her husband Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni who must deal with a mid-life crisis, her friend Grace Makutsi who must adapt to success, Charlie the Apprentice who is apt to make a mess of things as well as the typical clientele of the Agency; problems are solved.  The genius of Mr. Smith's series is the pacing.  There are no hurries.  He takes the time to explore his characters' feelings and reactions to life and does so in an engaging, surprisingly readable manner.  In a very telling scene, though there may be dangerous crocodiles in the water, Mr. Smith demonstrates that Mma Ramotswe can still, though wary, appreciate the beauty of her wild country.  Likewise, though our world is inhabited by crocodiles of a different sort, we learn that happiness can still be found and enjoyed despite all difficulties.  There is an unequalled depth to these characters and their stories are mixed with wry commentary on the human condition that is alone worth the price of the book--there is wisdom in these stories that far exceeds most of the drivel masquerading as literature.  Marriage is sanctified, virtue is rewarded, mercy is extended and rewarded; Mr. Smith convincingly portrays the conditions precedent to happiness and true satisfaction with life.  His stories give hope.    I prescribe all eight volumes for anyone who is weary of the world in which we live.  These books demonstrate that a gentle, peaceful life can still be had amongst the crocodiles 
 This book, like many of Harris's, is anthropological popcorn: It is delicious stuff that you can quickly devour.  This collection of essays is very important and interesting.  It includes his very influential expanation of the sacred cow in India, as well as analysis of European witchraft, cargo cults, and more.  The most amazing thing in the book is his argument that Jesus was one of many messianic revolutionaries running around Israel during the Roman occupation.  Read this section, and then watch "The Life of Brian."  Monty Python got it right on the nose.  The parallels are amazing, rival bands of revolutionaries all seeking a messianic figure...really great stuff 
 Author Bernard Haisch has been a professional scientist for at least thirty years. He has done research at the University of Wisconsin where his Ph.D. thesis gave a mathematical description of how radiation and light gets from inside a star out into space. Since then, his credentials as an astro-physicist are stunning.  His book, The God Theory, claims that the ultimate purpose for the existence of the universe and every being in it will never come from scientific experimentation alone. It will come from a conscious realization in each of us that we are creating God's experience.  The ultimate being, or the wholly other, or that infinite consciousness beyond which there can be no other, Haisch prefers to call God. It is the consciousness of God that produces what exists and we are part of it. Our consciousness is part of God's consciousness: what an exalted existence we have.  As human beings, our purpose is to live out the experience of God's existence in a physical realm. In God, everything exists in potentia or as possible. But we are the incarnations of God's consciousness in actu, or as living conscious creatures with physical bodies.   Most modern scientists attempt to explain distant universes, stars, planets, atoms, electrons, protons, and every existing creature including life itself, by reducing them to physical and chemical mathematical equations. But not Haisch.   As a physicist, Haisch would not deny such equations exist because he has spent his life hunting them. But the equations can be discovered because God consciously creates them. This is the logical step that scientists are missing. This is the scientific reduction to absurdity that Haisch's God theory steps beyond.  On the other hand, Haisch would expect religion to dispense with dogma and so-called revealed a priori truth. It must join with science to seek experiential truth that will raise man's consciousness to a mystical level.  The God Theory is an extremely easy to read book. When Haisch uses quantum mechanics, the big bang, Newton's laws, inflation theory, superstrings and numerous other scientific paradigms to reinforce his God theory, he does it with such simplicity that the average person can easily follow along.  Haisch's book is for the average reader dissatisfied with organized religion. It's for the individual who finds scientific discoveries fascinating but knows in her/his heart that the ultimate purpose of life somehow lies beyond.    
 L'edition francaise est plus complete et le packaging est en carton du plus bel effet.Sinon les bonus et langues sont identique 
 I love watching action movies, even if some of them are no-brainers! My purpose of going to the movies is very simple: firstly, to be entertained within a span of about two hours, & secondly to pick out some interesting & useful ideas.  Triple X is one such action movie. The plot is very simple: An extreme sports renegade (with no fear but has a bad attitude), Xander Cage (played by Vin Diesel), is recruited by a NSA big shot, Augustus Gibbons (played by Samuel Jackson), to spy on & then foil an attempt by a nasty group of Czech criminals, known as Anarchy 99, & led by a crazy villian, Yorgi (played by Marton Csokas) who had some nutty ideas to change the world using a biological virus, called Silent Night.  The many high-octane action sequences (cars, bikes, skis, boats, helicopters,...), all the way from the opening scene & the attendant rampant explosions, plus all the state-of-the-art weaponry, including a super-duper Bond-like vehicle, in the movie are quite fun to watch. The dialogue is witty, too. [For example, in Prague, while Xander was about to go to bed with a sexy girl, with compliments from Yorgi of course,  he remarked: "The things I'm gonna do for my country."]  Among others, there is one particular dialogue, between Gibbons & Cage, during the first half of the movie which strikes my personal attention.   When Gibbons offers Cage a job to work for the US government, with a view to redeem the latter's crimes, Cage turns him down flatly. That's when Gibbons tells him the story about the difference between the eyes of a lion in captivity & the eyes of a lion in the wild.   This also reminds me of an insightful dialogue between Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) & Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) in one of the earlier scenes of the movie, Rocky III. [In contrast to Triple XXX, Rocky III is an intelligent movie.] The movie tells the story of how Creed convinces & retrains a down-&-out Rocky to go back into the ring to fight againt Clubber Lang (Mr T) who had earlier gave Rocky a thorough bashing in humiliating defeat. In that particular scene, Creed tells the story about "the eye of the tiger".  Creed desperately wants Rocky to regain his focus quickly in order to win. Incidentally, this is also the title of the movie's signature tune.  These are certainly interesting learning points, especially in terms of understanding life (or survival) skills. I often share these stories with teens who are searching for directions in life.  In summing up, I have enjoyed watching Triple XXX & learned something interesting - & useful - along the way 
 This is a album of some of Stevie's greatest song played live with good results. The quality of his performances wasn't at his best but they were very good versions. This was an album produced to meet his recording contract requirements, not to please the fans. Although it isn't his best it is a must have for fans, it does have a few songs that were never released on studio albums. If you never got to see him perform live, this is a good taste of what you missed....a guitar hero & great showman 
 This is an album of broken love. There is so much sadness here. But there is also the best cowboy ballad on this record since Marty Robbins' "El Paso" and "Big Iron." "Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts" just goes on and on, seemingly without end, then poof, it's over and the Jack of Hearts has gotten away with all the cash. You need a refreshing, uplifting song like this to balance out all the heartbreak. Once again, Bob Dylan has proven that he is the absolute best at whatever he attempts. Once again he's turned out a record that once listened to, becomes a part of you. It seems he's done that a lot, is still doing it 
 Pair this book up with "Why a Daughter Needs a Dad: 100 Reasons" for a perfect gift for new parents.  Both of these books are wonderful! 
 I really enjoy Neal Asher's work.  He can develop atmosphere, characters and plot quickly and believably with incredible imagination.  The short story, The Engineer, is no exception, and is my favorite Asher work.  However, I was quite disappointed that this release of short stories, The Engineer Reconditioned, is nothing more than an update of the The Engineer published under a different label in 1998.  I was expecting a full novel continuing the premise of the earlier work.  Instead I received the same short story under a new name with some slight revisions.  Amazon needs to make this clear so people don't waste their money on something they have already read.  However, if you have not read it, it is a great read,  brissling with great concepts and intrigue. 
 I puchased this system a few days ago and am quite pleased with its performance. The DVD playback is fantastic - you really feel the surround sound - and the speakers work well. It can get pretty loud too.  The only minor issue I have is when I'm in "TV" mode the sound coming out of the rear speakers is pretty low. I've experiemented with all of the modes but can't seem to be able to get them up to the volume I would like. This is not a problem when playing a DVD or using the radio tuner, however.  Set up was extremely easy and a complete "no-brainer".  Great system for a great price 
 "Smart Moves" provides much more useful information about how students can use a college education to improve a person's weaknesses while simultaneously enhancing their stronger points.  This book gives a more helpful guide map than any freshman orientation!  I realized that you can obtain the main degree that you want to puruse, but also that it is important to take courses in other areas that can help you be wellrounded and allow yourself to stand out.  This book encourages young people to take opportunities of internships, jobs, and build relationships with professors to empower a person to find a job that will make them happy while also allowing them to become financially independent later on in life.  I nowunderstand the importance of using these opportunities to constantly build a resume that will increase the chance of obtaining a fullfilling career.  I recommend this book to any current or upcoming college student.  It's a superb book 
 There is an advantage to reading a book a few years after it is first published.  The advantage in this case is that the Saddam dictatorship is history and many of the assurances that lead us to war have been proven to be a little over hyped, to be generous.  That comment leads us to this book.  The author was the head of the UN weapons inspectors in the last two years they were in place, ending in 1998.  This book is his review of his time on the job and the obligatory musings about what needed to be done with Saddam circa 2000.  I had heard in a number of other articles and some books that the author was a bit arrogant and pushy.  To be fair, those personality traits, if they even exist, did not come out in the book.  The author presented his case in a rather fair sounding and well thought out process.  There were no over the top dramatics nor did it seam to me that the author was trying to stretch the truth to prove his point.  I  started this book thinking it would be one case after another of how Iraq had hid WMD`s, yet they were hardly ever mentioned.   By this I mean that the author only detailed out a few cases of papers being found and old weapons parts being dug up.  In all his pages on the inspection process, the author gives the reader no finds of the actual weapons the world was looking for.  All the author really detailed was the unlimited number of ways the Iraqi's found to be unhelpful, arrogant, and just plain nasty to his team. If there ever was a case for how not to play well with others the Iraqi's are the hands down favorites.  In hind sight, what is rather humorous is that if they would have just swallowed a little crow and let the UN run all over their county unmolested for a few years, they would have left and the Saddam cronies would still be in power.  This could be the first dictator to loss power due to unending amounts of arrogance coupled with a good helping of plain ignorance.  The last item I found interesting was the side story that bordered on a male cat fight.  This author and Scott Ritter, another of the weapons inspectors, had a few words while working together and both decided to finish the disagreement in the press.  About the only value in the comments is that it makes you smile a little to think that this author lowered himself to grade school play ground name calling in a book for the masses.  Overall, I found the book interesting in its detail of the way the Iraqi government dealt with the UN and how the French, Russians and Chinese all interacted with the US.  I also thought the very apparent lack of evidence of WMD`s being discussed in the book was a precursor of things to come.   If you are interested in the conservative thinking that lead up to the Iraqi war, then this book is an interesting bit a the picture.  
 I bought this book as a gift for a chiropractic student and they were thrilled.  Other chiro students in the class loved it as well and they all used it for some references.  
 Condition was excellent. I have told several of my freinds about my experience and encouraged them to use Amazon for all their books 
 I was very pleased with the condition of the books, and even more pleased with the customer service. 
 Despite its somewhat maudlin title and front cover, this book is very interesting. It based on Jungian MBTI theory which in my view is a very powerful tool for understanding people's personality. The book itself is not theoretical: it gives a brief description of the 16 types and then there is a couple of pages for each of the 136 possible combinations. Much has been printed about the MBTI, but this one has a very interesting practical approach. For each combination, you find a paragraph on the strengths, a paragraph on the weaknesses, and a short list of key recommendations for each partner. Even if you know everything about Jungian psychology you can still discover some new insights on personality relationships. For the anecdote, my INTJ recommendation list (with my ESFJ wife) is a pretty goood summary of everything I do wrong at home  
 I agree that this book is a great reference, and actually wish there were more editorial comment (whether I agree with it or not).  Another plus is a trivia quiz in the back, that we've had some fun with.  HOWEVER, it states that "I Spy" featured the first black performer (Bill Cosby) to have a regular role in a drama series. Not true. Cicely Tyson was in a drama called "East Side, West Side" with George C. Scott 
 Well... at least you know what it means when others are swearing ; 
 `Audition' isn't your typical horror movie, but like Japanese fashion, the movie gives a lot of detail and may be confusing to some people who aren't used to dream sequences explaining some of the story. I was overall impressed with the pacing and style of the movie, but I was a little disappointed to learn that one of my favorite parts of the movie wasn't in the original novel this movie was based on. Credit goes to Miike, the director, for the new ideas that were added to the story in this movie because the scenes that Miike added were probably the best parts. The biggest complaint I have of the movie is that the cameraman in some scenes couldn't keep the camera steady and it is shaky in a few parts. Nothing major, but it is enough to notice the picture not being steady.   The special features for the DVD are a great addition and answer some questions about the movie, mainly when they interview the author of the novel. I don't know if this could be considered a horror movie, it is definitely more of a suspense story. The author of the novel, Ryu, himself said that this isn't a ghost story or about a maniac with a knife, but more about the dark side of the human heart. It's not until the last few minutes of the movie when things get really bad, most of the time it is like a normal love story with a twist. If you like thriller suspense stories like "Psycho" that deal with the outcome from years of abuse, then you will like this movie. But, if you want a slasher that goes for the throat, this isn't for you because this story builds up to the moment instead of going straight for the jugular. Remember, the movie isn't what I'd call "scary", but more disturbing than anything else and it doesn't become that until the last twenty minutes. Then, you can bet, you will hold on to your seats and you are glued to the TV.   
 "Valley of the Dolls" is pure fun. It's got great characters--from the small town girl trying to make it in the big city to the actress who needs to feel real to the singer who wants it all. Reading this, I was reminded of today's soap operas and also other novels of this genre. It was, for me, a fun read, though sometimes a little dark. It's an older book but I think it's withstood the test of time. I definitely recommned it, along with "Take Your Shirt Off" or anything by Jackie Collins.  
 Good quality, particularly for the amazing price. Sturdy, well-made, and even the case is nice. Pops open in a second, collapses just as easily.   Keep in mind that fully collapsed it's wider than a standard backpack, so if you lash it under a backpack it will be awkward. But the strap on the carrying case makes it easy to loop the monopod and carry it vertically 
 What can I say. Every song is top notch. The Only song I usually skip over is "Little Bitty" but that song hit #1  so its just a personal preference.  "Walk On The Rocks" and "Buicks To The  Moon" are my favorites on this set. The closing song "It's Time  You Learned About Goodbye" is also a classic written by Alan. That  song was originally meant for Faith Hill but good thing he kept it for  himself as it is the the best closing song on any of his albums.  But I  love them all from start to finish 
 I took this book to Hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice.  I loved the relationship between the two main characters.  I felt like the ending may have been a little rushed, maybe because I did not want it to end! Also, I felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story. Matthew Lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book.  Other than that I loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars 
 Perhaps the most fascinating part of this book isn't even what's printed on the page - it's HOW its printed on the page. There are no paragraphs. The entire work is an assembly of short declaratory sentences (or less) arranged, spaced, and sized for maximum impact. Charts and graphs abound. It is clear that the author conceived the entire page, not just his words. This probably bothers some people (it certainly did for at least one reviewer on Amazon.com) but I find it not just readable but incredibly informative, cluing the reader in to the author's ideas about what's important and how certain concepts mesh together or can be juxtaposed for power and insight.  If you cannot accept this format (as is the case with a few of the other reviewers) the book will drive you crazy.  If you can get past it, though, reading it is a very enjoyable experience.   The book opens with and revolves around the very thought provoking question, "How many stars with the U.S. flag have in 50 years?" Most Americans would respond "fifty, of course" without any thought. Mr. Enriquez spends the remainder of the book providing insightful examples of how other countries have 'untied' (his term for the breakup of a nation into smaller, independent parts) and lines along which and reasons for the U.S. to 'untie.'  He covers portions of our neighbors, Canada and Mexico, that could under certain circumstances become 'new stars' for America.  He also examines the reasons and trends that my induce portions of the United States to 'untie' - a loss of stars for the United States.  The 'Blue State vs. Red State' divide is examined. The author observes that when populations within a nation become sufficiently self identifying and unintegrated, splits often occur, but not in the way that might seem most likely. Given that The South has already seceded once and makes up a significant part of 'Red America' one would think it most likely for the 'Red States' to secede again. Mr. Enriquez contends that this isn't the case. Most secessionist are by the more eoonomically viable portion. When a population or region becomes convinced that the could be richer by themselves, they secede.  Knowledge based economies alow smaller nations (cough, cough, South Korea, cough) to easily compete with far larger nations. Shedding regions that don't 'pull their weight' becomes an increasingly attractive option.  Mr. Enriquez does not, however, spend the entire book examining the United States.  Italy, Canada, the Balkans, The UK and Russia, among many others, are also used to illustrate concepts.  I highly recommend this book, regardless of your political stripes. It is neither Conservative propoganda nor Progressive talking points. It explores trends that are unfolding all over the world and explains how they will affect us.  See my full review [... 
 This was a wonderful book.  It read very fluently and was more captivating than most biographies.  L'Enfant noir is a wonderful example of the movement known as La Negritude, and it is the best French-language book I  have ever read 
 This is the best Gene Wilder Film. You can't go wrong, just look at the cast. Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder coproducing is the recipe for a great time 
 My original charger broke that caome wit the cell phone. I was going to go buy a charger but they cost like $30 if you get the name brand. This one I purchased does the trick and saved me lots of money 
 The author invites congregational leaders to weave spiritual practices into all aspects of ministry. The Soul of Tomorrow's Church will be restored as spiritual practices are woven in five ministry functions: worship, administration, education, soul care, and outreach. Every chapter teems with practical ways to weave spiritual practices of prayer, discernment, faith stories, silence, and hospitality in each one of these five specific ministry functions.  
 This book is a must have for any gardener! While I have always enjoyed gardening, it seemed the bugs always ate up my veggies before I could! This book teaches you all about plant "families", and which herbs and flowers are "friends" to the families. It is also very informative on plant diseases,insects, and what nature-friendly things we can do to help. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in companion gardening, organic garden, or just wants to grow something 
 I really love this wipes warmer! My baby used to cry when we changed his diaper at night but now that we use the warm wipes he hardly notices it and he does not fully wake up. I will definetly recommend it to other friends. The only drawback is that I could not buy it in Mexico so I had to ask a friend for it 
 The Reformation for Armchair Theologians is a "good read."  It provides a good and understandable outline of the Reformation with good questions for discussions.  
 Jose Gonzalez is a class act.  One of his greatest talents is his gift in combining a beautiful, tranquil voice with stimulating, rousing instrumentation.  'Veneer' reflects this perfect combination track after track, and brings the acoustic genre to a new level.  It is the perfect soundtrack for buffering this crazy world we live in today.  I was introduced to Jose via his work on the latest Zero 7 album.  His tracks on that cd bring depth and substance.  Likewise, 'Veneer' recharges the mind while soothing the soul...as in my favorite lyric: "Cast some light and you'll be alright".   I have seen Jose perform live twice and even had the opportunity to chat with him briefly.  Watching him live is a treat.  He becomes one with his guitar, as if he were born playing it.  Jose Gonzalez is a rare talent, a humble performer, and a genuinely good guy.  Get to know him...get 'Veneer' 
 I'll admit this freely: I'm not an obsessive Fatboy Slim fan who wants to own every single FBS song.  I'm a casual fan, and I bought this disc for a good overview of FBS's most popular hits.  If that's the type of audience this disc is aimed toward, it definitely succeeds.  The first six or so tracks are the ones that everybody's heard (and most people seem to like!), and the remaining twelve tracks lead the listener into songs that he or she hasn't likely heard on the ratio.  
 This is a great quality sheet. It is thicker than the standard pack and play sheets. It adds a little more padding for our munchkin. We purchased it in navy and have washed it several times. The color hasn't faded and it just gets softer with every wash. I highly recommend this product!

 I think this was a great spin off from stargate sg-1 which was starting to get stale even though I love watching it still.  Love being able to download them all, just wish they'd get updated quicker! Honestly, when I left 2 weeks ago I saw the last episode available and I've missed the next 2 
 I had the pleasure of seeing INXS during the Kick tour and after the concert, the very next day I proceeded to go to the music shop and purchase their entire catalogue and when I came across Listen Like Thieves I was sure this was a greatest hits collection, but no it's not...but it could be...not one bad song on that disc...I'm telling you right now, get it!  Heck, get 'them all, now with Michael Hutchence long gone it's as close as you're ever going to get to something this good...so sad he had to end it the way he did...just to think what else he would've come up with...like I said, don't delay...go get it and enjoy 
 Nice to find a nonfiction book that is fairly easy to read, well told story and not condescending 
 When I started reading this book, I wasn't all that excited because it was for a class. But, by the time I finished, I wanted to hold a protest of my own.  Or at least do something to make this country better. A true hero in my eyes, anyone who believes in equal rights and doing what you have to to make things happen should read this book!!! I highly recommend it to everyone!! 
 I originally read the first three novels in this series in paperback, many years ago.  The last two novels really make it all come together nicely.  Following the personal vendettas of Kirth Gerson against his "master criminal" (often space-age, corporate 'captains of industry' of a sort) foes is a highly-amusing, highly satisfying read.  This series is almost as good as Vance's Planet of Adventure, and the cynical, lyrical Vance style is wholly in place.  HIGHLY recommended 
 This book really helped me do some soul-searching the last time I looked for a job. It leads you through a series of easy exercises to make you think about your strengths and weaknesses, and lays the groundwork for finding your ideal job. It also offers a lot of sensible, practical advice about what to do and what not to do, most of which I now feel is indispensable to a job search. I recommend this book to you if you are interested in learning more about yourself and how you stand out in the world. It's hard to show anyone else what you're great at if you don't know it for yourself 
 Randy Newman is proof - and proof IS needed - that Americans have a sense of irony. From the haunting 12 Songs through his bitterly funny tales of the deep south on Good Old Boys to Little Criminals he tells complex, surprising tales of ordinary Americana. Little Criminals is an almost perfect showcase of his talent: from the poignant shards of songs like Texas Girl at The Funeral of Her Father and Old Man on the Farm, to the rollicking bravura of underworld fools of the title song and You Can't Fool the Fat Man. The ironic undercurrent of the gorgeously naive Jolly Coppers on Parade is wondrous, but for me, the highlight is the American anthem he provides in Sigmund Freud's Imprestonation of Albert Einstein in America. which includes the haunting, hilarious, hearbreaking lines: Americans dream of gypsies I have found/ Gypsy knives and gypsy thighs that pound/ and pound and pound and pound/ African appendages that almost reach the ground/ And little boys playing baseball in the Rain.. 
 This recording was picked by John Lewis as a dedication to their late  drummer, Connie Kay, who passed away in December 1994. It remained unissued  for 35 years having been recorded in Slovenia in 1960. Although the MJQ  have given us considerable music for over 40 years, this recording stands  out as their very best. Buy it, you won't regret it 
 Aristotle's Proportional Equality           Aristotle does not believe in equality, but proportional equality. He believes that people are naturally different in their intelligence and moral qualities, that these qualities naturally give them differing arete (this word has been translated into:goodness, excellence, merit and virtue), and that they should naturally be given different political rights based on these arete. However, Aristotle does not have any viable methods for detecting the nature of people. Instead, he artificially locks rulers, citizens and slaves into three unequal classes based on wealth and birth, and he tries to appease the lower classes with deceptive schemes. From its very core, Aristotle's proportional equality is unfair and does not allow freedom.         In Book Three, Aristotle establishes the theory that political equality does not mean everyone getting the same as everyone else. He believes that different groups of people in the city have equally valid claims to political rights based on differing criteria. To him, the different interest groups are, "The people at large, the wealthy, the better sort, the one who is best of all, the tyrant" (1281a11)         In fact, Aristotle states that political equality for one of these groups will always be inequality for the other groups. He claims,         "For example, justice is considered to mean equality. It does mean equality-but equality for those who are equal, and not for all. Again inequality is considered to be just; and indeed it is-but only for those who are unequal, and not for all." (1280a7)         After rejecting the distribution of political rights according to the interests of various groups, Aristotle states that the right basis by which political rights should be conferred is the degree of arete one contributes to the city. Through this, proportional equality could be achieved. He writes,         "Those who contribute most to this association have a greater share in the city than those who are equal to them (or even greater) in free birth and descent, but unequal in civic excellence (arete), or than those who surpass them in wealth but are surpassed by them in excellence (arete)." (1281a2)          The rationale for this proportional equality based on arete is simple: the city "exists for the sake of a good life*" (1252b27), and the good life is only achieved with arete. Therefore, naturally those who have more arete should be given more political rights because they can best utilize the resources of the city to make life good for all. Aristotle establishes the full connection between good life of the city and arete in Book Seven.          This connection can be summarized as the following: the city is for the best life possible, the best life is the life of happiness, happiness requires action, and action is the exercise of "arete".  Aristotle first defines the good life as the life that aims at happiness. He says that the object of the city "is the best and highest life possible. The highest good is happiness..." (1328a26). Aristotle also proposes that "happiness is a state of activity; and the actions of just and temperate men bring many fine things to fulfillment." (1325a16) The purpose of activity or action, "praxis", however, is exactly to do or achieve "arete". Aristotle writes, happiness is realized by "the actualization and perfect practice (praxis) of goodness (arete)" (1328a26).           The structure of the differing arete is as follows: Aristotle states that the rulers/statesmen have the arete of good man which allows them to rule, the citizens have the arete of good citizen that allows them to rule and be ruled, and the non-citizens/slaves have only enough arete that they are condemned to obedience.           To Aristotle, the reason that people have different arete is that they naturally have different levels of intelligences and moral qualities. And since these qualities are what make a person and a city good, people are allotted proportionally equal but unequal political rights. On intelligence, he believes that some are just intrinsically better. For example, regarding slaves, he says,            "...(and this is the case with all whose function is bodily service, and who produce their best when they supply such service)-all such are by nature slaves...... if he participates in reason to the extent of apprehending it in another, though destitute of it himself." (1254b16)           On moral qualities, in Chapter One of Book Seven, Aristotle says that external goods are not as important as moral goods are for achieving happiness, however, only some are capable of achieving high morality. He says,         "you can see for yourselves that the happy life-no matter whether it consists in pleasure, or goodness, or both-belongs more to those who have cultivated their character and mind to the uttermost..." (1323a21)          In Chapter Two, he makes it clear that the statesmen and philosophers, in another word, the rulers are most fit for the cultivation of morality and intelligence, which combines to be their arete. And since the goodness of the state needs morality, those statesmen and philosophers should rule. He writes,         "Here, we may say, are the two ways of life-the political and the philosophic-that are evidently chosen by those who have been most eager to win a reputation for goodness (arete), in our own and in previous ages...for whether individuals or cities are in question, wisdom must aim at the higher mark." (1324a19)          Certainly, Aristotle is right in pointing out that there exist differences between people. For a state to operate well, the people who are more equipped for intellectual and moral tasks should have more political rights. And if there really are those who have no "deliberative elements" in their soul, then certainly those people should be under the command of a master if not a doctor. There is an identical interest between the good rulers and the ruled, which Aristotle rightly points out in Book One,         "The part and the whole, like the body and the soul, have an identical interest; and the slave is a part of the master, in the sense of being a living but separate part of his body. There is thus a community of interest, and a relation of friendship, between master and slave, when both of them naturally merit the position in which they stand." (1255b4)         From the above summarizations of Aristotle's positions, it is clear that Aristotle's whole theory of proportional equality is based his belief that some have better moral and intellectual capabilities. However, although these qualities are important, the test that Aristotle uses for determining them is not an equal educational system in which all could compete equally or some ingenious device for detecting people's IQ, rather, the test is about people's wealth and birth. These are not the right standards by which one's abilities could be judged upon, and thus Aristotle's theory fails.            The importance of money and wealth is explicit in Aristotle's differentiation of the citizens from the non-citizens/slaves (the mechanics and laborers' works have a "servile character" [1277a29] ), and less explicit in his differentiation between the citizens and the rulers/statesmen. The first differentiation is as follows,         "There are thus good grounds for the claims to honor which are made by people of good descent, free birth, or wealth, since those who hold office must necessarily be free men and pay the property assessment. (A city could not be composed entirely of those without means, ay more than it could be composed entirely of slaves.) But we must add that if wealth and free birth are necessary elements, the qualities of being just and being a good soldier are also necessary......The one difference is that the first two elements are necessary for the simple existence of a city, and the last two for its good life." (1283a3)        It is easy to look at the second part of this passage and be left with the impression that Aristotle is saying that money does not matter and that been just is the most important quality according to which one should be judged by. But the first part of this passage is far more important; it shows that Aristotle is building a city for the better off. As shown later in the book, Aristotle does not even consider the majority of the city citizens of the city. He says, "the conclusion which clearly follows is that we cannot regard the elements which are necessary for the existence of the city......as being `parts' of the city..." (1328a21). While the wealthier people must strive for intelligence and morality, try to be just and exercise their sacred political rights, the poor people are forgotten and are not even given the chance in the good constitution that Aristotle talks about.         Although it is obvious that wealth and birth are not "natural" qualities that define people, Aristotle still insists throughout the book that the non-citizens/slaves are naturally inferior. Aristotle believes they have no arete other than those that allow them to be subservient to others. In Book One, he says about the slaves,          "...in treating of slaves, that they were useful for the necessary purposes of life. It is clear, on that basis, that they need but little goodness (arete); only so much, in fact, as will prevent them from falling short of their duties through intemperance or cowardice." (1260a24)         This idea of "naturalness" is easily disprove by the fact that Aristotle later says that what really makes the non-citizens/slaves, the mechanics and laborers, naturally bad is that they have no time for arete and the cultivation of their souls. He argues,         "The best form of city will not make the mechanic a citizen. Where mechanics are admitted to citizenship we shall have to say that the citizen excellence (arete) of which we have spoken cannot be attained by every citizen, by all who are simply free men, but can only be achieved by those who are free from the necessary tasks of life." (1278a8)       This argument is nonsensical. All along, Aristotle has been saying that those who should receive no political powers are borne lacking the qualities that contribute to their arete. But here, by saying that citizens who do no hard-labor are better than mechanics and laborers simply because they have more time, Aristotle is indicating that the lower class lacks arete because of their lack of education, which is a social, not natural result. This is a gross contradiction.         The second differentiation between that of citizens and ruler/statesmen is trickier. Aristotle superficially says that the two are equal, but subtly there is difference.        The arete of the good citizens is to both be ruled and to rule. Aristotle writes,         "...the fact remains that the good citizen must possess the knowledge and the capacity requisite for ruling as well as for being ruled, and the excellence (arete) of a citizen may be defined as consisting in `a knowledge of rule over free men from both points of view'"(1277b7)            Aristotle frequently mentions this view that the ruler/statesman and the citizens are political equals and should rotate positions. He says in Book One that "the rule of a statesman is rule over free and equal persons." (1255b20) He also says in Book Three when he tries to define citizenship that, "the citizen in this strict sense is best defined by the one criterion that he shares in the administration of justice and in the holding of office." (1275a19)                          However, hypocrisy emerges when he defines the arete of ruler/statesmen, who are the only good men. Contrary to before, he differentiates between rulers and the citizens, and makes one class higher than the other. Aristotle says "practical wisdom is the only form of excellence (arete) which is peculiar to the ruler... the virtue (arete) of a person being ruled is not practical wisdom but correct opinion." (1277b16)           This is strange. If "practical wisdom" is what distinguishes the ruler from the ruled, then, when the ruler becomes a citizen again, is he suppose to loss his "wisdom" and become someone who only has "opinion"? And if the citizens are suppose to have "a knowledge of rule from both points of view" as mentioned above, why is Aristotle saying here that they are only capable of "opinions", which is far inferior to knowledge.          Aristotle seems to be trying to fool most of the citizens into believing that they have equal rights as those who are ruling, while disenfranchising their rights at the same time. Aristotle does not explicitly say that wealth and birth would decide who should rule, but it follows from the arguments before regarding free time that they must. While many people could qualify as citizens if they are moderately well off (1279a25, in polity, the property requirement for citizenship is only arms), and could hence afford some leisure to cultivate their arete, but those most wealthy people who could spend all of their time for the cultivation of their soul must be the ones with the best qualities to rule.          To be sure, this hypocrisy in another form is apparent right from the First Book in Aristotle's discussion regarding woman. Although he calls the relationship between husband and wife the relationship of statesmen and citizens, he in fact subjugates women to man. He writes,          "In most cases where rule of the statesman's sort is exercised there is an interchange of ruling and being ruled: the members of a political association aim by their very nature at being equal and differing in nothing...the relation of the male to the female is permanently that in which the statesman stand to his fellow citizens." (1259a37)          Aristotle is offering a grand contradiction within the space of a paragraph. He defines the relationship between masters and citizens as equal just before he says that one is "permanently" subjugated to the other, and yet, he still maintains that this relationship is indeed equal.            To be certain, Aristotle is right in that even today, those who are of good birth and wealth are more likely to be suitable for higher social positions than those who are from lower social-economic backgrounds. And when one looks at the current President of the USA, one could trace his family's wealth and fame three generations back. However, these people who are borne in families of higher social status are only what they are because of the good family influence and the good education they had.         The President went to the best of boarding schools, of universities and of businesses schools and his father was everything from the head of the USA to the head of the CIA; how is it fair to compare him to the Hispanic dish-washer whose parents worked illegally in that restaurant off the high-way, and who despite all eagerness to learn had to stay home to take care of his five younger siblings when he should have gong to highschool?        Aristotle is right in saying that people should achieve what their nature allows them to achieve, but he does not allow people's true nature to come into being. If slaves are given as much opportunity to study and work, then some of them surely will become philosophers, poets and other politicians. A city that allows that would be the city that is capable of achieving the best life possible for everyone.        Aristotle was intelligent, but he lacked the humility to realize that he did not know everything about human nature. There is nothing wrong with proportional equality, because the better should have, and have always had more power in states, but the key is how to find those good people who could contribute more to the arete of the society. Aristotle pointed out some of the right qualities that they need, but he wrote the Politics from the vantage point of the higher class, and classified people not according to their true abilities, but according to their social and economic conditions. In order to appease the lower social classes, he deceived them by giving them the rights of citizenship or by simply telling them that they are intrinsically incapable. And even for those who were citizens, he still tricks them into believing that they have more political rights they than really do. In this world, there is certainly no equality, not even traces of proportional equality, but most importantly, there is no freedom. There simply can be no freedom when people are locked into castes and can not realize their full potentials. 
 I read this book during college. It changed my views on dating. I work as a High School Youth Director and I pass it on to high school students to read 
 The ideas on dealing with bedtime hassles made my life, and my girl's, much easier. She can still be difficult, but I've learned how to respond more effectively 
 Is a very pleasant, short, decisive, informative book and to the point.  It surves its purpose and broadened my knowledge. Worth every penny which will help you or any relative you know cope with this disorder.    Marie Kanaan Los Angeles, CA 
 This book touched so many aspects of human nature!  I sat and read, teary eyed for a couple of hours, finishing this book today.  Great story.....about people.  When a character such as Macy, whose childhood was terrible, overcame what could have tormented her for life, she maintained a kind heart that makes you wonder.  Macy deserves Mark.  His love is the recompense for what she survived 
 The Saltwater Cowboys are at it again, as they are charged with the rescue of 120 passengers on-board a hi-jacked plane which is forced to land in Kazbekistan. Joining the SEAL team in the covert operation is FBI hostage negotiator Max, agents Jules Cassidy (who merely is window dressing again) and Alyssa Locke, who continues her tortured romance with Lt. Sam Starrett., and Reserve shopper pilot Teri Howe.  This time out, it is crusty Senior Chief Stan Wolchonok who gets the love interest, though he tries numerous times to blow it by setting her up with hunky Lt. Mike Muldoon. Teri Howe is the pursuer, while Stan tries to steer clear of the whole enlisted verses office fraternization rule (which does not apply to reservists). Each step Stan tries to take away from her, she takes two steps forward. It is nice to see the least romantic of the SEALs show his softer side.  This one is fraught with so much tension and a pretty harrowing assault of one of the passengers (as the negotiation team has to sit by and watch and listen in abject horror). Negotiator Max wrestles with his growing feelings for the hostage, who is nearly 20 years his junior, and his inability to save her in time.   One thing I can do without is the WWII junk. I just skip over that stuff. It does not add anything to the story line other than additional pages. I like when they use an alternate font so that skipping is even easier!  I usually do not like serial books, but this particular series manages to make each book stand on their own merits. You really get to like the characters, and they pop up all over the series, but it is not a forced inclusion like some of the other stories I have read. I look forward to each new installment 
 This book was recommended to me by a real golf fanatic, Nobby Orens, as  there is a bit of a fanatic in all of us that love the game of golf.  This  book has some very, very funny chapters. If you play the game of golf,  you'll enjoy this book 
 A friend gave me an original of this book--1900's edition, and I was hesitant about reading, but once I started, I LOVED it so much; it could be a classic, and Gene Stratton-Porter is a fabulous writer.  The story pulled at my heart strings, and I kept thinking how I'd love to see this become a movie!  It is a story of tenacity, beauty, perseverance, love, and success in spite of adversity.  Highly recommended!! 
 I was looking for this book for a long time until I thought of using Amazon online.  This book was so helpful to me when I was a young newlywed.  In moving around a lot, I lost my original copy.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning how to cook Chinese food.  It is written in simple and easy to follow directions.   
 I'm about 25% through it. I'm thoroughly enjoying the book. I ride a BMW GS myself in backcountry and less-traveled roads, although I've not and may never do anything close to what the author did. This book a great story and provides wonderful insight into a fantastic journey. It's not just a recount of a journey. It's also about what he thought, what he enjoyed, what he feared, what he learned. The photos aren't great, as just black and white and not great quality. But they still add a lot to the story, showing you important events along the way. Just to say it's not a coffee table photo book about the journey.   The book I think will also open your eyes to just how much there is to learn by getting out into the world and seeing and experiencing how others live, and how that might affect you personally.   The information in the book is dated in as far as the world has changed since his journey. But if you're considering any similar journey, I think this book is a definite read for you as it gives insight into just how many surprises you will probably face. What you will face today is different, but the character of his journey is still I think entirely relevant.   If you enjoy this, you will also enjoy the Long Way Round DVDs highlighting the trip that Ewan McGregor took (get the long version if you can find it). Both are not to be missed.   This is a great book to read sitting by the fire on a cold winter night when you can't ride and want to get away in your mind to some fantastic and far-away places. 
 2005's "Upside of Anger," missed out during the awards season; and it didn't do well at the boxoffice. But don't pass it by. It features a chilling performance by Joan Allen as a boozy abandoned stay-at-home wife (her husband has apparently left for Sweden with his assistant), and a great comeback performance by Kevin Costner as her neighbor, who plays a beer-buzzed ex-baseball player turned radio dj (he's been hired to talk about baseball but he doesn't want to).  The scene where Costner first learns Allen's husband has abandoned her is a hoot. He arrives at her door, beercan in hand, to discuss the idea of turning those tulgy woods behind their property into a subdevelopment, and things progress bizarrely on from there, as the ill-matched pair end up making each other comfortable, and finally they're at least embarked on the road to happiness.  The supporting cast is great, too. Allen has four daughters, superbly played by (from oldest to youngest) Alicia Witt, Keri Russell ("Felicity"), Erika Christiansen ("Traffic"), and Evan Rachel Wood ("Pretty Persuasion"). Each has a memorable scene or two or three. Director Mike Binder turns up as Kostner's not quite pervy producer. He overdoes the sleazebag bit, but maybe that's the point.  Beware! The film begins (and ends) with one of those pseudo-significant voiceover narrations (by Wood) and a funeral scene (in the rain, of course). That might make you roll back your eyes and hit the eject button. But don't do it! There's a quick flashback to three years before, and when the action starts, you begin to realize that you haven't seen all of the characters you're now introduced to among the mourners. And so, with the various crises that develop along the way, you begin to ponder who among the others was being buried.  When you find out, it's quite a shock. 
 "The Water-Babies" by Charles Kingsley is best described with reference to J. M. Barrie's more famous work "Peter Pan", both of which belong in the canon of Victorian fairytales. Kingsley's work is poised between two words: the world of Christianity and the whimsical realm of fairies, and the onset of the scientific and historical developments that resulted in the evolution theory, industrial factories and the War. Although certainly not as famous as Barrie's tale of the boy that never grew up, Kingsley's story is equally fascinating, though much more difficult to read.  Tom is a young chimney sweep of London, under the brutal care of Mr Grimes who doesn't hesitate in sending him up the filthiest, narrowest chimneys whilst he collects the money from downstairs. Tom himself is quite the little savage, but when his master is employed at Harthover Place, he is in for a surprise. Getting lost on the rooftop and crawling down the wrong chimney, Tom finds himself in a room where three things change his life. The first is a picture of the Crucifixion on the wall. Having no idea who Christ is, Tom is rather intrigued by the picture: "Poor man, he looks so kind and quiet. But why should the lady have such a sad picture in her room?" The second is the young girl asleep in the bed, beautiful and peaceful. The third is his own reflection in the mirror, which horrifies him - "Tom, for the first time in his life, found that he was dirty".  Accidentally waking the little girl on his way out, Tom sets the entire household upon him - out of the house, across the moorlands and down the valley to meet his "death" in a nearby creek, and his rebirth as a water-baby. And there his adventures really begin, as he investigates his new form, meets the river-folk and begins his journey to be reunited with the little girl in the white bedroom - Ellie, who has not forgotten the boy who woke her from her sleep.  Like Barrie, Kingsley's story is chock full of allegory and moralising, namely concerned with images of baptism and rejuvenation, as seen from Tom's transformation from "dirty" (figuratively and literally) to the white form of the water baby, to the moral growth that he gains over the course of the story. Presiding over all of Tom's adventures is the Madonna-like figure of Mrs Do-as-you-would-be-done-by; a fairy queen that takes many different forms and names throughout the course of the story. As well as this, there are touches of the Victorian fascination with insect life, as Tom's `evolution' could also be compared with the pupae and larvae stages of the insect life cycle that (with the onset of microscopes) was being explored by biologists of the age.  But Kingsley's story falls short in several aspects, namely when he is speaking to an adult audience rather than a child one. Though the story is subtitled "a fairytale for a land-baby" and the narrator is conversational and chatty throughout (in fact the style reminds me a great deal of C. S. Lewis in the "Narnia" series) calling the reader "little man" and often providing legitimate queries that the reader would probably be asking at that time, often he strays away from Tom's story to discuss his own personal opinions and theories on the general mindset of the Victorian world - some of which is amusing, some of which is tedious.  For instance, Kingsley perhaps gives us the strongest evidence of the existence of fairies in the world - or at least why experts can never really claim that fairies, water babies and other such creatures do not exist. Only his own words can really do this justice; as the reader says: "But there are no such things as water babies," to which he answers with devastating logic: "how do you know? Have you ever been there to see? No one has a right to say water babies don't exist until they have seen no water babies existing." You can never prove a universal negative!  But these amusing ponderings, and tongue-in-cheek criticisms on other Victorian minds will probably be far over the heads of any children that the book is aimed toward. I can't believe I'm saying this, considering I hate having original books tampered with, but perhaps it would be best to read a young child an abridged version of Kingsley's story, and waiting till they're older for the complete text.  For the record, I got my copy at age nine, and didn't get it finished till ten years later. Furthermore, it is a book of its time, and you'll find within its pages several disparaging remarks directed toward the Irish, Americans and several other ethnic groups (heck, this *was* written during the British empire!)  However, Kingsley's book is a necessary inclusion into the library of children's literature - namely because it can be enjoyed by adults too. With a poignant look at the horrors of a sweep's life, to the humorous commentary on his contemporaries, his intriguing philosophy on the nature of fairies and the sublime moments of Christian spirituality, this is a classic to be read and re-read in childhood, adulthood and old age; it'll be a different story each time. 
 I'm pretty new to the country music scene as I grew up listening to heavy metal and hard rock and am still a fan of the genre. I swore I'd never listen to country music. Recently I started broadening my listening tastes and have found I actually like some of the newer country artists out there. I've purchased CDs from Kenny Chesney, Chris Cagle to Keith Urban, but I must say--when I saw CCR's video Constantly on CMT--I was blown away. I had to have their CD. For those of you who like your music with a bit more edge, this is a must have for your CD collection. I haven't heard a song on the Purple Album that I don't like. And Cody Canada has a soulful voice that I could listen to for hours. Great job, guys! I'll be looking for more from this talented bunch of guys--and if they ever make their way North--I'll definitely be seeing them live 
 Leo Tolstoy had a midlife crisis at age 50, and decided that he had to find the meaning of life or else commit suicide. He found it in the teachings of Jesus. No, I mean he really actually found the meaning of life, like not just for him, for everyone. He then totally revamped his life, becoming a heroic figure.  Jesus was a pacifist. Since governments have military, any true pacifist is necessarily against government. "Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand" means - "change your way of life, for the secular kingdoms of the world are about to be replaced by a united divine kingdom." Tolstoy profoundly appeals to the conscience of the reader to do what is right, from the spirit of God and truth within you, instead of what is in your personal interest.  Tolstoy's Christianity is not that of a Church, but that of Jesus, especially from the Sermon on the Mount. Most so-called Christians largely ignore the teachings of Jesus (e.g. nonviolence!!!) and concentrate more on salvation, faith, Church dogma and tradition, Paul's letters to the Corinthians, the Old Testament, miracles, ressurection, etc.   When reading it, you will find that the things Tolstoy says jump out at you as strikingly and undeniably true. Tolstoy also displays his pure brilliance and tremendous compassion. This book inspired Gandhi to become the great peace advocate he was 
 and I bought this book anyway and I'm glad I did. My wife and I took a vacation in Mexico last summer and we've been trying to think of what to do with all the souvenirs. This book has so many ideas like the shadowbox table, which we plan to make. The only reason we haven't is because we can't stop looking at the pictures and reading the memoir pieces. I never realized crafting could be so purposeful and meaningful, the author really expresses that in her writing. So maybe I'll become a crafter afterall.. 
 This is one of many books of quotes by Pope John Paul II.  It is a good set of quotes at a nice price. A great gift for any one... very readable.  Highly Recommended 
 I won't dissect the installment since many others have done excellent jobs of that here, but I will say that while I enjoyed this installment, it did feel a bit long.  Some have complained about the loose ends that were not tied up here but given the nature of this series, it should be clear that loose ends created in one book will probably be addressed in latter installments.  That said, I could have done without the addition of Fr. Callahan as I felt his back story and connection to Salem's Lot just didn't feel important. I've never been a fan of vampire stories and so that just accentuated my dislike for the long time spent on Callahan.  Taken as a part of the greater story arc, it was satisfying and it compelled me to carry on to the last book. 
 As a huge fan of Anthony Rapp from RENT and "You're a Good Man, Chalie Brown," I was pretty confident I'd really enjoy his solo CD.  I thought I'd listen to it all the time; put it on repeat while I studied, or cleaned my room.  Wow, I was wrong.  Love is hardly a strong enough word.  Nearly every song on this album speaks to me, personally.  I was a little concerned about some of the songs; the beginning of "Human Tornado", for example--I thought I would hate the song, or some of the instrumental beginnings, but each song settled into mood of its own.  I've heard people condemn his lyrics for being somewhat trite (as in "Living Alive", for example), but there's such an honesty in the simplicity.  Absolutely every time I hear "Out, Out, Damn Spot!" I start laughing (even at work...), and I have cried every single time I've heard "Visits to You".  Fine, I'm typical and emotional.  So sue me.  I loved it 
 Murphy's book is a comprehensive review of Voisin Grass Productivity book complemented with his own experience in Vermont.  I read it and found it very helpful in my search for milk production productivity and profits in my dairy farm in the Coffee area of Colombia. I am still looking for books or experiences with Voisin rational grazing in the Tropics, where we use mainly grass to feed our cows outside and have followed feed companies advise on supplementing grains and feedstuffs, without questioning prices of grass, milk, corn silage and supplemental  feeds. If Murphy worked with the Voisin system in Brasil it would be great to have his experience written in a second book for Latin America 
 I've enjoyed this book mainly because of the way that readers can quickly find advice about common concerns on a wide variety of video topics.  The author speaks authoritatively and uses events from his work as examples.  However, these examples sometimes are so specific to the author's experience that they seem very narrow and difficult to reproduce.  Yes, I'm a novice, a rank amateur trying to learn more.  So I don't know all the terms that the author uses about lighting equipment, for example.  And the author doesn't bother to define some items.  Thus, the book is of limited use to the novice videographer.  Finally, the title is a bit of a cheat.  The initial paragraphs for each chapter are labeled as "solutions," but they are really just introductions.  Gimmicks like that make me question the book's credibilty.  Still, I've enjoyed the book and benefited from its advice.  It's always nice to learn from the pros 
 The book helps us to think about what our grandparents could have done in the past.  It makes us wonder about times before ours.  The character is funny and caring, easy to like.  The pictures help us to imagine what is going on.  A good book to read with family 
 This is a great book that touches on many of the tremendous tools and resources CS2 offers. It has been of great benefit for our business, BrothersMedia, per workflow, image processing, etc 
 Old Hat New Hat was one of my kids' favourite books and now my grandson loves it too. Perfect for the just learning to speak or read age-group. Simple and funny as well 
 I feel kinda cheated. The best songs were the same three that were available for free on Jean Jacques's website [...] The other tracks were mostly just filler - Perrey doing what he can do the best - but they didn't quite reach Moog Indigo's status of uniqueness in my opinion. Crazy music nonetheless.   And it's impossible to be serious if you're listening to this -- strongly recommended to all you serious people 
 Excellent!!!!I highly recommend this documentary, it's a must have for every Pac/hip-hop fan 
 So much of our world's business energy and investment capital go into information technology and biotechnology, which are fields where most of the important technology is so small as to be invisible to normal human vision. Author Amato explores how the human drive to improve our lives and our world led us (from the 16th century on) to see, measure, manipulate and control ever smaller particles and entities. The mysteries of dust, and then germs, then atoms, and now subatomic particles, viruses and prions, one by one "bit the dust" as they were revealed by this compelling quest. Bearing an amazing array of facts and stories (like the best musty and dusty library stacks I remember from college) as well as an approach both philisophic and humane, Amamto is an entertaining guide on this journey from bulbonic plague to Hoover vacuums to semiconductor plant clean rooms. I think his book helps explain the deep hopes and fears (and the high market valuations) our age invests in our interaction with unseen 
 Ordered this for my son's 6th birthday and he really enjoyed it!  It's great at explaining it at a "kid level" and he giggled througout the book! 
 I has no problem with the seller, the item came sooner than expected, always a plus  Thank 
 A good book, especially if YOU are the control freak.  I'm still working at it; it's a day-to-day struggle to realize that overcontrolling only hurts those you love.

 It will only take two or three days to read LAST CALL.  The chapters are short and it moves very fast.  However almost every page contains something humorous, the characters are terrific, and the storyline is engaging.  If you're getting bored with chick lit by now then this is the answer.  Well-written and highly original.  Somehow it contains a great love story, a coming of age story, and a few spirited (and funny) debates on religion and euthanasia.  If you've ever dealt with being a single mother or taken care of aging parents you'll find a lot to identify with 
 PS: I forgot to mention the SWING. All the mystery is gone, dont spend anymore money in swing lessons or swing gadgets, trust me Thank yo 
 Seldom have I seen such an easy read which is a concise, accurate, and to-the-point review of the Guatemalan Maya and their progeny from the Classic Period to the 1990s.  In the interests of brevity, early cultural history is scanned, but the essential information is covered from 209 AD to the entrada of the Spanish Conquistadors led by the cruel Pedro de Alvarado and continuing through the multiple exploitations that occurred to recent days.  The role of the United Fruit Company, the military, and the CIA are discussed frankly.  Topics of the economy and society are succinctly covered as are current religious practices with the syncretism of the Catholic, Mayan, and the encroaching protestant sects.  Visit Guatemala and you will know that these tough, resilient people, both Mayan and Ladino, are not to be denied.  While there, visit with individuals who survived the Civil War and hear their stories.  You can not help but become a sympathetic traveler, not just a tourist.  Volums have been written about the turmoil in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America, but if your time is limited, here is a helpful shortcut 
 Also check out her work as X-perience. Claudia creates a wonderful mix of classical / gothic / soundtrack and European Pop in this album. The record has amazing soprano vocals and great acoustic as well as synth recordings.  The tracks are dark, yet still playful. Think of Enigma, Sarah Brightman and Enya mixed together, but she also has her own unique sound.  She covered 2 tracks: Blasphemous Rumours by Depeche Mode and Crawling by Linkin Park.  Don't miss this exciting work and make sure to search for her work as X-Perience as well 
 If one wished to understand how life was in the 50s and 60s as well as to understand the mind of a genuine conservative, one only needs to read Right from the Beginning. Pat grew up as a Catholic in Washington DC, attending Catholic high schools and universities. Anyone who was an altar boy or who attended Catholic schools could identify with this story. It is a brilliant piece of writing by a brilliant man 
 This book is a great general reference for the world of industrial design.  It not only covers top firms and designers, but includes a section on materials and their influence on design.  It is not a judgement of good or bad design, but rather a chance to look at all approaches to consumer product development.  The images are beautiful, and the book itself is very well-designed.  As an industrial design student, the struggle to find interesting text is constant--this one does the trick 
 This book is great. It shows just how ridiculously far we've taken this "Political correctness" 
 Grendel is unlike any other novel I have ever read. I was drawn to it largely because of its controversy--I have a special spot in my heart for banned books--and found a justly famous novel that was, nonetheless, deeply disturbing. The novel works--and is so disturbing--because it thrusts the reader into a completely alien mind. Gardner's Grendel is a self-absorbed devil, as in Beowulf, but he has psychological depth, which is the book's greatest strength. He sees human foibles with an unforgiving eye and hates humanity for its perfection. He hates himself for being himself.  I found myself really unnerved when I began to understand what Grendel was thinking. And after the feeling of shock wore off, I felt awe at the novelist's ability. Gardner gives us an absolute monster and makes us understand him, and that is what makes this a great book.  Highly recommended 
 While I agree with some of the other reviews that state much of this information is available elsewhere, it was nice to find it in a well written book nicely packaged together.  The book begins with a nicely written piece on the Sinclair Lewis book "It Can't Happen Here" and compares the current administration to that in the Lewis book. The author then begins a tour of the cast, which include all the favorites: Bush, Rove, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and dozens of others, many of whom were players in the Nixon and Reagan administrations.  Descriptions are provided of the actions taken by this administration to create a perpetual war, so that the power of the President can become unitary. There is also thoughtful commentary of how the religious right and the corporate right got together behind Bush.   The book is not flattering to most of the participants, and it is scary how close we were to having a theocracy in the United Sates. Although many people have battled to keep this from occurring, it seems as if it was the self destructive work of the current administration that kept us free from that occurrence.    This book is recommended for any thinking American, and should be required reading for every voting American. This book would also be a good background book for those thinking the President should be impeached. The book is well researched, documented and written!  
 A tense and violent story of the relations between an American missionary family and Amazonian Indians in Peru.  A classical tale of colonialism, the story is riveting, even though a few of the characters (especially the missionaries seem prescribed.  The reader turns and twists throughout the book and is continually surprised, yet the story progression remains clear 
 it does a great job, i just tought it woundn't let any hair go, but i gess that's impossible 
 If you have any interest in what happens to make a U2 concert happen, by the crew members, designers, and band, this is the book for you. It is not only a backstage pass to most of U2's greatest tours, it is also a technical approach to a technical process. Pictures are pretty good too, but don;t purchase this book if you want some old photos from long-gone tours; buy this book if you want to read about the tours. This would be a good book for someone interested in becoming a "roadie" or stage crew member, and all the like, for it talks a lot about how and why the tours were as they were. It will require a lot of reading, so don't thing it is a simple page turner.   If you love U2, want to know more about their tours, from the inside out, this book is for you. Get ready to read 
 There are hundreds of books that claim to simplify the theory of relativity for the general public. "Inside Relativity" is among the few that actually achieve this goal without loosing the beauty of Einstein's theories. The strength of the book comes from the structure as well as its cogent language. Many others fail to set the context for Einstein's entrance into the scientific scene but Mook & Vargish do this quite masterfully. There are many valuable references sprinkled throughout the book. I did consult few of them before finishing the book and that may have biased my opinion. This book should be on your bookshlef even if you think you know what Relativity is all about 
 Aperture is indeed the preeminent art photography magazine, and consistently has enough good material to warrant a subscription independent of its clout.  Although ostensively devoted to art photography, many of the spreads are essentially photojournalism.  If you are primarily interested in just art photography, and can subscribe only to one magazine, I would suggest "Blind Spot" 
 In making his case for his theory that guilt motivates liberals, one of the helpful things Levite does is point out some of the blatant contradictions of the Left.  One of these is that Socialist movements have  been led by children of the affluent, and comfortable intellectuals, not  workers themselves.  Another is that Marxists simultaneously believe in  historical inevitability, yet unlimited human potential.  Another is the  contradiction of environmental determinism: leftists believe that the  environment determines poor people's behavior, so they are not responsible  for their actions, but rich people ARE responsible, not only for their own  actions, but for society's ills.  Well, which is it?  Do people have free  will or not?  People in some economic classes have free will but not  others?  What about poor people who become rich?  Levite's observations  leave one scratching one's head, wondering how intelligent people could  ever buy into leftist inconsistencies.        Levite makes some logical  errors too though, unfortunately. For instance, he theorizes that the  children of the affluent who develop guilt and become socialists do so due  to cultural influences of the Judeo-Christian ethic.  Though there may be  some members of the religious left (as he mentions) that are fuzzy brained  enough to confuse socialism with Christian principles, Levite's theory  incorrectly assumes that all "philosophical guilt" is from  Judeo-Christian sources.  Clearly this is not true.   Levite himself  contradicts his own theory because throughout his book, he portrays Asian  leftists and Communists as being motivated by the same kind of  "philosophical guilt" as their Western counterparts.  Clearly,  Chairman Mao, Pol Pot, the Viet Cong, and other brutal Communists of the  East were never much influenced by the Judeo-Christian ethic, if at all.   Levite also theorizes that Plato, one of the political leftists of ancient  Greece, was motivated by the guilt of inheriting unearned wealth when he  wrote his despotic Republic.  Obviously, Plato was not influenced by  Judaism or Christianity, Christ being born 400 years later than Plato.       I also took exception when Levite mischaracterized religion by alleging  that religion has "...two flawed precepts: that self sacrifice is  always right, and selfishness is always wrong."(p. 185)  Christianity  never says this, Levite got it wrong.  Christianity says, "Love your  neighbor as yourself," which means treat your neighbor AND yourself  well, period.  I don't have the space to do it here, but I would argue that  it is not Judeo-Christian influences that cause children of the wealthy to  feel guilty and set out to (sometimes brutally) equalize everyone, it is  the LACK of Judeo-Christian beliefs that cause them to do so.  It is not  just that these people are cut off from the world of manual labor, it is  that they are cut off from knowledge of their Creator.  Knowledge of their  Creator would teach them things that would prevent them from becoming  totalitarians or bleeding heart limosine liberals.  These include 1) that  Divine Providence has a reason they were born into affluent circumstances,  and they should discover that reason, 2) that they may well decide to  volunteer to help the poor, but forcing everyone else into interventionist  government schemes that often hurt the poor is wrong, 3) that only the  falsely virtuous give to the poor in order to get public "credit"  for it, via the symbolic gesture (like the Sadducees of old), that 4) human  life is sacred, and the shedding of human blood is never justified, except  in self-defense, and finally 5)as only God can create perfection, and one  man's idea of utopia is another man's hell, secularist utopian schemes are  not only doomed to fail, but evil when forced upon on the unwilling.        So Levite missed the target in tagging Western religion as the source of  "philosophical guilt," but he did illuminate things about the  Left that I hadn't understood before.  One of his ending recommendations is  that libertarian efforts should be aimed at helping guilt ridden liberals  end their self-hatred and instead foster self-respect.  But how is this to  be accomplished?  How about making liberals accountable, in real tangible  ways, for the programs they advocate?  How about insisting on the truth of  liberal claims as judged by results, instead of letting them get away with  their ad hominem attacks on their opponents and their empty symbolic  gestures?  All in all, this is a very provocative book, and one that  hopefully will generate honest discussion.  I am definitely more  knowledgeable for having read it 
 When I purchased this book, I was looking for a potential text for a short-course on writing the disseration I'm teaching. I really expected the standard "here's how to search through the library and databases." This is simply much more that that. It's less about how to do the review itself and more about how to think about your topic. In fact, Hart raises the questions I should have been asking myself--if only I had known--and my advisor wasn't. How much better my work would have been if I'd had an understanding of how to analyze a text from various perspectives. Many texts offer advice on how to write but few talk about how to think about your question and how to fit it within the context of work in your discipline.  Hart does this 
 Junie B. has a problem that she needs to deal with and quick, she is scared of Halloween.  Of course her fears are based in "fact" because she got her info from an 8th grader and as she states they are almost adults.  She works through her fears in a logic that, I think, very much paralles the thought processes of a first grader.  Barbara Parker makes this girl take life in a fantastically funny manner.  She makes Junie intelligent and witty, sometimes to witty for her own good.  This was my first encounter with Junie but I can assure you it will not be my last.  A must read for either caretakers of small children or Halloween lovers of any age. 
 The epitome of the snapshot. HCB has such an eye for composition; counterpoint, balance, symmetry, symbolism and just plain humour. I find myself shaking my head, often in disbelief at how he manages time and again  to catch that 'decisive moment'. This book has his Paris prints beautifully  reproduced and the one-line descriptions mirror the mood of the entire  collection - glimpses of life, love, conflict, smells, textures in that  colourful city. Colour rendered in black and white 
 This book is DEFINITELY a book to read while you wait for the next Harry Potter or Lemony Snicket book to come out. It will keep you on the edge of you seat the whole way through. And, since all of the books are now out, you don't have to wait for the next book in the series to come out, as with Harry Potter or Lemony Snicket. THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK IN THE SERIES!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Bravo!  I just can't say enough about the award-winning epic series, Broken Saints.  The creatorz of this phenomenal show,  Brooke Burgess, Ian Kirby, and Andrew West, describe it as a "cinematic novel".  It was first introduced to the world solely via the internet back in 2001.  The creators, despite pouring years of blood, sweat, and tears into their work, made no financial gain.... And since it'z humble beginnings, the series has evolved into a special-edition dvd format, with a next generation console game coming out soon.  The animation itself is partially animated but primarily utilizes flash animation.  The soundtrack, as composed by Tobias Tinker and Quentin Grey with other pieces by Mozart and others, can only be described as haunting.  As opposed to the web version, the special-edtion dvd makes use of dramatic voice talents and sound effects. Again, the artwork on this show is mind-blowing and the dialogue is spell-binding.  FYI, Broken Saints is not a light-hearted cartoon.  There are a lot of complex, profound issues dealt with on this show.  And upon watching it, I think you'll agree that it is highly relevant to the age that we are living in.  All in all, Broken Saints is a must-see (at least once, although it will certainly take several more viewings for all of it to sink in) and I highly recommend it 
 This book is a good introduction to different aspects involved in extreme programming.  The author is the initial proponent of XP. First part of the book explains the present day software development realities(like deadlines etc) and the pitfalls that take place due to these time sensitive expectations. Author moves onto explain the necessity for XP and what are the basic guidelines of XP.  The author should be commened for covering where XP is impractical and should not be used. The book explains the life cycle of a XP project and different roles that are part of this radical process.  XP is not suitable for many present day organizations(due to age old approaches that are already implanted in the system); but should be considered for time sensitive deliverables. This book will definitely give a headsup on how to approach XP.  Small negative: The book takes too much time on what is wrong in other traditional approached to software development(for the size of the title:about 200 pages

 What a great series of books for 2.5 year olds and up.  The illustrations are wonderful, the story line is sweet and charming, and my Son loves to hear them over and over.  This is our 3rd and we plan on purchasing the remainder 
 My husband and I all are both Tolkien fans but neither of us had managed to really get into the Silmarillon.  The book's length and somewhat stiff narrative slowed us up or put us off.  Finally we heard that the audio book version was good and thought we'd give it a try.    While the beginning "creation myth" may still be a bit slow for some people the audio book version overcame many of the book's obstacles.  The reader has a clear, sonorous, English-accented voice which is a perfect match with the tone of the story.  His commanding narration bought to life the tragic tale and completely engrossed us in the story in a way that the book failed to do 
 As always, Professor Feynman writes with humor and deep insight.  While the lectures that make up this book were given in 1963, they are very relevant for the current conflict between religion and science.  The titles of the three lectures tell it all - Uncertainty of Science, Uncertainty of Values, and This Unscientific Age.  Science is uncertain and that is its great strength.  It must be uncertain to accept new ideas.  In contrast, any belief system based on faith must be certain in its beliefs.  This is not to say that there is no place for religion.  Science says nothing about morality or ethical behavior- subjects better left to religion.   The last lecture focuses on our unscientific age, with examples of unscientific thinking and how this leads to erroneous conclusions, which are unfortunately widely accepted.   This is a short book, so it is better to read it for yourself than to get my take on it.  If you read it, I am sure that, regardless of your preconceived bias (in favor of science or religion), it will get you thinking; Feynman always does. 
 Thriller is a platter of thirty superb, unique and varied hors derive.  One finds proscuitto with melon all the way to caviar with baby swiss with many other varieties, tastes and spices between. Many and varied tastes are tempted by these bite sized stories.  As others have compared this to the "Forrest Gumpish, box of chocolates" one knows these confections are neither sweet nor nutty after the first taste. These are true mysteries and thrillers of the first order with authors offering everything from two wonderful historical vignettes through detectives, spies, good scares, and even one Marxist theme spy story. This is a new genre of fiction and thereby gives teasers into these varied authors' style and flavor. This is not just an ordinary anthology of short stories or a digest version of longer novels. I find this a well-done must read and a most difficult book to describe to others. Readers must try this for themselves or miss a very tasty array 
 If you are interested in how FDR turned the country around and infused it with a sense of optimism, replacing fear and confusion with purpose and concrete plans, read this book.  A more descriptive title would be  "Voices of the New Deal," because this is a book of the  recollections of many of the prime architects of Roosevelt's programs 
 Excellent Wolvie comic book. Shows the darker side of Wolverine. Lots of action, good emotional characterizations. Few interludes in the action, but those that are provide great interconnection. If you read this book, you must read Enemy of the State Bk. 2. No question about it 
 Will Smith captures the heart of a father's love for his son in Just the Two of Us.  This book is a must for every father and son to read 
 This film is a great directorial debut for Todd Solondz, as well as for Heather Matarazzo (Dawn Wiener) and Eric Mabius (Steve Rodgers.) "Welcome to the Dollhouse" is more of a bleak rather than a black comedy, and presents a believable (and depressing) view of suburbia, junior high school and adolescence in general. 
 This is a great documentary, very sly, subtle and informative.  Made up of interviews with prominent bandmembers from the Britpop scene it documents the rise and fall of the Britpop phenomenon.  It also shows, via interviews with Damon Albarn, how a fairly good band - Blur - can be brought low by its own hubris and by a popular perception that the band was 'not authentic enough'.  It also shows, via interviews with Noel and Liam Gallagher, how another fairly good band - the Beatles tribute band Oasis - can be so over-hyped that the bandmembers end up in Cloud-Cookooland thinking they're geniuses and working class heroes when in reality they've become multi-millionaires of musical mediocrity living in mansions, with about as much in common with the working class as Bertie Wooster has with Jeeves.  Also covered is the manipulation of Britpop and Oasis by New Labour.  The whole thing is tied together using interviews with Louise Wener (the lead singer of Sleeper) who gives her perceptive thoughts on the Britpop phenomenon.  It seems that many here think this documentary is a homage to Oasis.  I saw it very differently.  When we see Gallagher in his mansion talking about himself being authentic working class it should become clear to everyone that the documentary is poking subtle fun at him and criticising the whole contrived Oasis vs. Blur 'battle of the bands' working class vs. upper crust thing.  I mean get a clue folks!  The whole thing is hilarious - the Gallagher brothers must be high as a kite if they think their current situation makes them the salt of the Earth to anyone but those whose brain capacity is on a par with Blackadder's Baldrick or Monty Python's Mr. Gumby.  At least Damon Albarn realises he was played for a patsy - I don't think the Gallaghers really know, but then again why would they care?  After all, they made out on the deal.  By the way, the Oasis tribute band Wonderwall had me in stitches - I mean a clueless tribute band paying tribute to a clueless tribute band.  It's classic!  An awesome documentary with a lot to say about how the Gallaghers betrayed their roots while still thinking they never left them.  Honestly Gallaghers, get a clue - when you get mansions and Rolls-Royces you have to give up your claim to the working class mantle.  You're nouveau riche - deal with it 
 If you love Jerry Garcia and haven't heard these CDs... I recommend dropping everything and getting them immediately. As the first (official) JGB release, they got to pick from the cream of the crop...and as a result, all tracks are great...with certain tracks being absolutely fabulously great...notably Siimple Twist of Fate, Senor, Deal, Tangled up In Blue...and a whole lot of ETC.  The other glowing reviews have already said it so I'll wrap up by repeating...if you love Jerry Garcia, these CDs are an ABSOLUTE MUST.  Inspired playing throughout!! 
 This book is a must have for a nursing major. I use this every semester to help me write care plans. It is easy to understand and gives you all the information you need to write an effective plan 
 I love JD Robb (Nora Roberts). This was a short story originally published in a collection. It was still wonderfully written and didn't leave me feeling like I was missing something. The audio version is perfect to listen to on the ride to work, it makes the time fly. 
 This book has been around for a long time, but it continues to be a favorite in my classroom. It's one of those simple books that sparks so many different curriculum paths! Counting, number groupings, nutrition, cooperation, family activities, word choices, story writing, and more. It has also initiated collage art projects, quilt making, and paper mache vegetables! FEAST FOR 10 is a goldmine. I see that it's coming out in a board book soon, too. We have both the hardcover and several paperbacks in my class 
 i love this book, would recommend it to anyone with small children. it is comforting and sweet. 
 Sometimes you just want a movie that is predictable, but that you can watch over and over again 
 If you want to get a good picture of what lies beyond our earthly realm this book has it. God poured out his Spirit on simple street beggar children and they tell of the visions and experiences he gave them. The book gives very detailed descriptions of Heaven and Hell; the Kingdom and God and the devil's Kingdom. The book can be read over and over because it will change your perspective on why we are alive today, and what's really going on behind the scenes 
 What can I say, except for Alton Brown is a Food God.  Alton allows you to take a look at what you should own in your kitchen, regardless of all the shiny toys and one-hit-wonder implements out there today.  He lays it all out, letting you know what you should have and why you should have it.  Using this book makes your life easier if you're either an amatuer or semi-pro like myself because it allows you to buy stuff you actually end up using in your kitchen, instead of that double boiler that sits in the corner gathering dust 
 A real sleeper - I'm surprised after reading it that the book isn't more well known. Very well written and compelling. The author juxtaposes the war and it's history with the daily life of the people living it. She's a keen observer of both history and human nature. She does, I think, leave out some history that seems important now but maybe they weren't to her at the time. Highly recomended. 
 On a cold day in February, a stranger arrives in the small village of Iping.  He is completely covered from head to toe and all you can see is his nose.  He demands a room at the inn and is persistent to tell be he wishes to be left alone.  He spends two days in the room muttering and talking to himself.  He then goes out to get "a thousand and one bottles" to start these secret little experiments.  Then one night a store is robbed and not a clue is found to figure out who robbed the store.  Then later that month the owner of the inn tells the stranger that he needs to pay his bill for the inn.  He had been putting the payment off and now he immediately pays her.  She then becomes suspicious and asks the stranger where he got the money.  He says that he had it, but the inn owner doesn't believe him.  She insists on finding out where the money came from and then truth is reveled.  The stranger admits that he stole the money from the store that was robbed and then reveals that he is invisible! The invisible man then runs away from the town and no one knows where he goes because he is invisible.  The invisible man then meets a poor man named Thomas Marvel who decides to try to help him.  Thomas Marvel then discovers the invisible man is slowly going insane and begins to run for help and to warn other people of the invisible man.  The invisible man then goes out to find a school buddy from college who can help him.  He finds him and his name is Dr. Kemp.  Dr. Kemp is amazed at what he sees and tries to help the invisible man calm down.  The invisible man then tells his story of how he became invisible. He was a very pale person and wanted to experiment with invisibility.  He killed his father and stole all of his father's money.  He then created a machine that creates an absents of light on whatever object it is used on.  He also created a drug that makes the blood of your body invisible.  He first experimented on a cat and it was almost successful.  The claws did not become invisible and the tapetum behind the cat's eyes did not become invisible.  The cat then ran away and the invisible man decided to perform the next experiment on himself.  He took the drug and turned the machine on to himself.  He felt like he was dieing.  He then watched his hands slowly fade and his body went with them.  After he had become completely invisible the pain went away.  He then wanted to go out into town invisible.  However, he realized that he just got dressed and went out people would see the invisibility.  So he robbed stores for covering for his body.  Nothing on him could be seen. After explaining the invisibility, the invisible man explains to Dr. Kemp how he wants to start a reign of terror!  Dr. Kemp realizes that the invisible man is going mad!  The invisible man then leaves Dr. Kemps home.  Everyone is then put on guard to watch for the invisible man.  Then it is reported that a man was killed, assumed to have been done by the invisible man.  Dr. Kemp then gets a note the invisible saying that the he is going to kill him.  The invisible man comes to Dr. Kemp's house but is stopped by a friend of Dr. Kemp's.  They get into an argument and then both go up to Dr. Kemp's door.  When the door opens the invisible man shoots the friend and starts to go after Dr. Kemp.  Dr. Kemp escapes and runs to the police.  He tells them that a man is trying to kill him so the police follow him.  They meet him and find out that the man is invisible.  The invisible man then runs into town with the police following him.  They are shouting to stop the invisible man and then one of the town's people whacks the invisible man with a shovel.  He falls to the ground dead and then people see the real invisible man. I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan.  H. G. Wells is a really good science fiction author.  His books are awesome!  However some parts of this book do get a little boring.  Over all it was a good book and I give it 4 stars 
 The story line is superb ... the scenery is stunning and gorgeous, vast mountains and green valleys, walled castles and fortresses. Hidetora, the aging warlord, holds a conference with his three sons and local chieftains on a mountainside. He announces his decision to relinquish the leadership of his kingdom to the eldest of his three sons. Only one son, the youngest, dares to speak up and state that during his lifetime he has known only war and fighting, he predicts the same after the transfer of power. He believes there will be power struggles between his two older brothers due to jealousy. The youngest brother personally has no desire to be warlord. Hidetora planned to leave one castle to each of his three sons. He has each son hold an arrow and asks them to break it in half, which they easily do. He gives them in succession, three arrows bundled together, representing the unity of the family, none can break the bundle. This is Hidetora's example of how the family will remain strong if they remain unified. He envisions the House of Ichimanji to be powerful and his eldest son to be overlord of the kingdoms attained during Hidetora's own reign of power. In his anger, Hidetora banishes the youngest son accusing him of defying his wishes ... Yet Subarua, the youngest, holds his father in esteem and respect throughout the predicted battles which come to pass.  Hidetora visits Taro's castle after the power transfer and finds his concubines have to bow and kneel to Taro's wife, Sue'. They are forced to move out. Hidetora discovers after the transfer of power, he is no longer respected. Sue' married into the family to consolidate land holdings and property attained as the spoils of war, a war in which her parents were murdered. She harbored revenge in her heart ever since and now urges her husband to fight his brother, Jiro. Hidetora's court jester creates a mocking song about Taro being like a gourd, spinning this way and spinning that way, implying he can not make a sound decision and stick with it. At a family gathering Taro hears the song and is outraged ... In a surprise move, Hidetora and his guards leave to visit Jiro. Hidetora discovers he is not welcome there either, not at all what he expected. He left abruptly ...  The treachery to gain power and control over the lands and castles by the two older brothers consumes them. As predicted by Subaru, the younger brother, war is inevitable. Local chieftains must decide where their loyalties lie, which brother to support. Hidetora goes into hiding. Eventually he goes mad. His only guard and caregiver, the jester, does not leave his side. This film contains very strong battle scenes. The desire for control and power is the true motivator for both older brothers. Loosely based on Shakespeare's King Lear, this Japanese version is astonishing in scope and grandeur. The costumes and scenery are fabulous. In the film, there are tender moments between the jester and Hidetora. There are moving scenes where Jiro's wife escapes to find her brother who was blinded in a past conquest and lives alone in a cottage ... The producers and directors create a phenomenal ending and conclusion. At some point, Hidetora reawakens from his madness long enough to recognize the impact of his decision on his family and the near destruction of the kingdom he once ruled.  The ending is climactic and leaves a major impression on the viewer. The film is amazing! Erika Borsos (erikab93 
 This book is a profound indictment of many churches and synagogues today who fail to recognize the "counter-cultural" prophetic voice of the Biblical faith.  Exploring the lives and teachings of Moses, Amos, Isaiah, and Jesus, Brueggemann rightly contends that our religious roots call us to be passionately critical of the cultural status quo and to embrace an energetic, optimistic vision of the future.  A very readable, relevant critique which will challenge the views of liberals and conservatives alike 
 The newspaper room was alive and bustling with typewriters, we got an inside look at how reporting, editing, journalism to politics works...blah, blah...and so forth, which brings up an interesting question concerning the health of U.S. democracy under re-emergent conditions of clandestine acts of war consorting with a political machine. Maybe overlooking the theft of American elections should be looked on instead as a humanitarian gesture so that America can avoid succession by assassination like that strung from Kennedy, to Nixon to Regan.  Don't ever listen to republican whining over measly office break-ins known as `Watergate'.  It is an asinine snow job if ever there was.  There is no `conspiracy' in arriving at, opening and then leaving a crime scene unprotected so people claiming to be `reporters' can carry away the evidence on a political assassin and plant any evidence they please, Bremer:  More FBI pooh-pooh.  There is no such thing as hiring muggers to do police crowd control in Manhattan in 1970.  The republican party is an illegal Class C, totalitarian organizing.  It should be hauled in and broken up before it pulls its next stunt.  It is Clear and Present Danger to national security from totalitarianism.  Copping to the lesser charge, actually came after an elaborate effort to posture innocence, when Nixon had to bluster to Flint (the FBI `deep throat' man) while Hoover's successor was away, that the detaining of Bremer should have been more brutal (even swearing for Pete's sake, gosh!).    In another instance of primate aggression, Nixon had to thank personally the lunkheads who swung crowbars and wrenches at non-rioting student protestors.  This is not a proboscis monkey who should ever have held public office, he would have looked good in stripes, somewhere with plenty of bars.  Let me tell'ya, don't ever beat that monkey in a fair election.  Not a good idea, and if you're running mate has to be from Texas (due to the way politicians get married off), never choose a man who has Mao and Saddam sized reliefs of himself in his Presidential Library.  Why poke fun at his mug handles?  Johnson didn't have to worry about `right from wrong', knowing "what `wuz' rite" saves at least half that effort.  One of the slush funded wrecking crew perpetrators intimated their non-involvement by whining about Senate investigation asking familiars if he associated with Bremer.  Always whine/deny before being put in the position of making denials. Anthropologists are not certain when planning ahead became a neocortex in those primates, but it seems to have put history in a revisionism spell; whining to steal the banana has become multi-dexterous, `five fingered' in its backward and forward directions.   Even CBS'ers `Criminal Minds' has profiled the serial killer's habit of arriving early and often at the scene of their own crime, except that the lone assailant, nut-job model seems to be the chapter on criminal law they prefer above all others.  Nixon telephoned a rather heated and timely self exoneration without skipping a beat, amazing the `deep-throat' operative Flint with a verbal lapse of decorum. Preemptive monkeyshine is about all I can call it.  Flint's in the clear, has written a book and Bob Woodward has published in 2005, titled "The Secret Man".  If that isn't good enough culpability, the FBI will take care of the more palpable actus rhesus.  I mean actus reus, the non-tangential connection to either avoidance, nonfeasance, obstruction, or crime scene, open house tampering free-for-alls:  candlestick, lead pipe, dagger, etc.  It's important to improve the profile of the covert operative at the most open invitation to do a little trash removal and apartment restoration.  Sort of perfect the identity, oh...write down a few emphatic journal entries...get rid of all the conflicting material and information aligning the agent with the political offense itinerary--Muskie.  Did you know our doctrinal separation, supposed to provide the essential element of integrity, accountability, checks and balances has conflicted the appointing of the FBI's director?  Not to mention the freaking Supreme Court Justice too!?  I'd have to laugh if I didn't own it, along with you.  In "The Secret Man", Woodward skips the mess Flint helped bury in the FBI's litter box surrounding the collusion and assistance to loot/alter the Bremer apartment crime scene investigation zone ; but in the original co-authored "All the President's men", Bernstein and Woodward do faithfully report the FBIs bungling in broad daylight with the nest of an obvious member of the slush-funded competition wrecking crew.  Poor boy Bremer seemed to be quite the traveler on his measly $1,600 tax income claim, "stalking several candidates".  We have Wikepedia the online free encyclopedia to thank for that citation on Arthur Herman Bremer; however their article blames the apartment owner for the ease of access to the press, not the FBI; Bernstein documents the FBI's arrival and then unattendence for an hour and a half--that's when rummaging was conducted by so called `reporters'.  An expense account deficit is not a `conspiracy' (in the modern airhead vulgate), it is called evidence, and it is applied all the time in courts of law.  Sorry to spoil the big revisionism on the legal entry in Blacks Law Dictionary, 8th, "Conspiracy"--a whole page of wry variations that is not a work of fiction.  Woodward telephones Flint, at that time the number two man at the FBI, (media diversion revelation since 9-11 ).  Flint won't discuss Watergate, even though they have had prior conversation about the Wallace assassination attempt.  Flint says not to call him again, meetings are arranged with an outdoor semaphore and note left in Woodward's morning paper.  In the first meeting of the Post's editors we see the demotion of the Bremer-diary story for a story about `McGovern offering the VP spot to everybody' after `The Eagleton Affair'.  Never was George Wallace mentioned. Movies distort and attempt to revise history here, with likely planted disinformation. Monetary incentive fits Bremer's apartment doctored profile.  The `Watergate'-construct in American history has and will crumble like the cheap plaster it is, similar to the Valarie Plane deception.  
 This is THE best coaching book for beginner to intermediate coaches I have  EVER read.  I think so highly of this book that I feel all coaches should  be handed a copy as soon as they sign up for a coaching job.  This is the  book that basically made me the coach I am today.      When I first began  coaching high school hockey, I sought coaching education in all the books I  could find.  But for a beginning coach, many of these books fell short with  the simple fact that new coaches need to learn from the bottom up.       This book not only remembers to teach you all aspects of coaching you will  need to get started in coaching but hits on a lot of the aspects that you  may not even have considered.  This is the first book I read that hits upon  the idea that coaching is more that X's and O's.      Many coaching books  fail to realize that organization is the key to successful coaching.   Practice and season planning are covered in a way that a new coach can  begin planning their season immediately.        Physical conditioning  planning and teaching plans are covered in a way that no matter what the  sport is that you are coaching, you can apply the lessons taught.  From how  to make up your season outline to how to set and reach your team objectives  are covered to the point where you can gain the confidence you need to  succeed.      But also covered are things such as how to avoid legal  problems, how to deal with parents and how and when to run meetings with  both parents and players.  These are the very details that most hockey or  coaching books seem to leave out.  And these are the very things that all  new coaches need to get information on BEFORE they begin.  And after  coaching for four years on the high school level, I have needed ALL of the  information I gained from this book.      I can not recommend this book  enough.  EVERY COACH IN EVERY SPORT SHOULD OWN IT 
 I have to write to tell you that this product is amazing...we had Hurricane Katrina friends staying with us for over a week. They brought their 4 cats plus my 3 all inside my small house. I remembered the Feliway that I had purchased and sprayed it around the house.Within 15 minutes,my youngest cat,Lola,who had been cowering in fear for 3 days came out and started PLAYING with the others!! I couldn't believe it! This is a great product and I didn't mind the smell,because it's mostly alcohol that evaporates in minutes...thank you for this product!! Jan F 
 This book is the heart of a lot of controversy, and that alone makes it worth the money to buy and read for yourself. I wonder at it's authenticity since names have changed, many words have been added, and many have been taken away. I would recommend any reader of this book to read it critically and compare it to a modern Book of Mormon, but the authenticity of this book will ultimately be based on faith 
 Stories which are on paper do not have the magical effect. The book gives a deep insight what the art of storytelling is 
 This book is very well written and helped me through a tough period in my life when I read it in the 80's.  I had been having flashbacks and decided to see if I could figure out what was going on.  It provided me with a blueprint and a course of action, which helped me find myself and do something about what had happened to me.  I would recommend this book to any victims of childhood sexual abuse 
 I have read the most excellent first edition and this 2nd, too. These  books pose interesting questions for the next generation of  "Teachers" and the Educators that we spend money to support. The  first edition has a preface or introduction that should be re-printed so  that the Modern Reader can compare the two. This should be Required Reading  in High School!! 
 Not as tuneful as NEU! 75 or as revered as NEU! #1, it is the most interesting in terms of remixing.  By simply slowing down and speeding up different tracks they create totally different feelings and totally different songs.  Super 16 and Super are polar opposites, 16 is slow and druggy and sounds like the monster under your bed, plain super is intense and punkish.  The modern concept of the remix starts here (plus the rest of the songs are beyond excellent, as it goes without saying for NEU!).  While the other two are most listenable, this is the NEU! you CANNOT live without a minute longer 
 The title of the book is Come On, Rain by Karen Hesse.  Thisbook is about a girl named Tessie.  Tessie wants it to rain because itis so hot. ... I liked this book because it has rain and sunshine.  I also liked the drawing of Momma's hat.  YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK because it has a lot of beautiful pictures in it 
 Christopher Paolini's Eragon: Inheritance was a pleasant surprise. Paolini was 15 when he started writing this epic tale, and 17 when it was first published. That alone is extremely impressive. But I would have loved it just as much if an adult wrote it.   Originally, I wasn't going to read the book, even though I had heard of it. But then, I saw the trailer for the upcoming movie. I was intrigued. Boy, was I glad I did.   This is a wonderful coming-of-age story. Eragon is a young teenage boy who was raised by his uncle in a poor village. He happens upon a mysterious rock that ends up changing his life. As Eragon matures and goes off in search of two killers, he is trained by a strange old man named Brom.   I was immediately swept up in the book within the first chapter. This epic tale of fantasy and lore is not only beautifully written, but exciting as well. There are quite a few surprises along the way. And all of the characters have depth and unique personalities.  This is the first in a trilogy, Eldest being the second book that was just recently released. I plan on going out and getting it soon. 
 Great old songs by a great old grou 
 I think Philip Yancey really helps put a new face on how we precieve God. Sadly churches have done little to often to help people cope with bad events in their lives. I think his book is very good and will be recommending it to my grief support group. Going though a profound loss and trying to keep our faith that God cares is not easy.    Ruth Bake 
 I've been playing banjo and guitar for about 25 years now, and have always been a bluegrass fan.  I think it would be hard to find an album that better represented bluegrass music.  It's not often one encounters a more talented collection of musicians in any genre.  Bluegrass music audiences are fortunate to have this and the other Bluegrass Album Band recordings as some of the finest ever made 
 I plan on working my way right through the book as all the projects look excellent. Nothing complicated and the materials are ordinary beads and crystals easily available. Some call for wire and some for fireline, Nymo, etc. Several of the bracelets (including one earring) were not  in Bead and button. Fully illustrated and definitely recommended to beginners and intermediate beaders 
 Jacqueline Bisset in a wet T-shirt. Five stars. Thank you for your time 
 Nicole Krauss is a pro at observing little things about all facets of life from the little gestures we make, to the way we say things that don't come out quite right and then we're mad at ourselves for what we've said (or not said).  Obviously, she has lived and watched and empathized with the characters she so elegantly writes about.  There are really two main characters in the book, an old man (Leo) who is trying hard to still matter and to perhaps have a relationship with a son he lost through the war through separation and the marriage of his soulmate Sara to another man.  He is a very intelligent and sensitive soul, creative, a writer and locksmith, but has really only survived and has never grown after he lost Sara so many years ago.  We observe the world from his old and weary perspective as he  tries to make sense of his life and the existence of a book very similar to a book he wrote in his youth.  The other character is an insightful 14 year old girl who lives with a damaged yet intelligent mother and younger brother who thinks he may be a religious icon.  Her name is Sara.  The two main characters, Leo and Sara become connected through the book "The History of Love" and the plot gradually unfolds.  I loved the way Krauss tells the story through the diaries of these two main characters and from their totally different perspectives.  I felt love and empathy for both character almost like I have been in their shoes or will be in Leo's shoes as I age.    It was a touching, interesting well told story.  I will be watch for her next book.      
 I first heard this story when I was 11 yrs old in sixth grade.  Our teacher read it to us each day for several days.   Afterwards I checked it out of the library and read it again and again, I have continued to read this book every few years, I have an autographed copy of it on my bookshelf, I am 38 yrs old and this book is forever in my personal library, it is the story of how Claudia and Jamie solve a grand mystery while on the run from the boredoms and fears of life.  This book made me want to read about Michaelangelo and sculpture art, not to mention take as many trips to as many museums as possible.. and I always wanted to sneak and hide in some bathroom and spend the night. Not to mention I am always tempted to climb over the ropes and sneak into those places I am not supposed to go in museums.. but I refrain.. sigh.. I love this book 
 The docu tells Milks story. It's touching and insightful. A piece of San Francisco's history in this 80+ minute movie. I was impressed and I learned a lot. It's well deserving of its Oscar 
 I got "she comes first" for my husband 3 weeks before I bought this book.  She comes first is one of the best book purchases ever.  Based on that, I bought this book.  It has some good info on the psychological side of a man's sexual needs, and a few tips and techniques for women.  It was a little dry, and I felt the focus kept coming back to me, the woman.  It is a very nonjudgmental book, and is very reassuring.  It does not expect some amazing bedroom act, rather it shows you how your own emotional tendencies are found in him, and how to satisfy them.  It is a simple book with simple techniques that are extremely effective.  I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS BOOK, AND IT'S EVEN BETTER IF YOU GET "SHE COMES FIRST" WITH IT.  My husband has turned into a different person since this book, and I am loving it 
 I am currently taking the anthropology class of Dr. Stoller (Magic, Religion & Witchcraft. He gave the class quite a few great books to read, including his. From reading his book, I learned what the title actually means: the social world, the one we live in & the world of the spirits. These are fused when the spirits leave their world and come in contact with ours by taking a medium's body, to transmite a message. Its the possesion of the body and mind, the fusion we cant see, while the medium sees the natural & supernatural. I recommend his book and his teachings 
 This is a great product.  It's easy to use, darn near fool proof and sharpens knives quickly. Finally we have sharp knives at home, I wish I had bought this years ago.  Well worth the money as it is very well made. 
 This is the first of what is currently a series of 11 books all staring a female named Honor Harrington. It is not without reason that this is the most popular sci-fi series of the past 14 years. My personal suggestion is to not read any of the idiotic reviews that tell you what the book or the series is about.. since it will just spoil the adventure for you. If you've never encountered this series before.. just buy this book and keep going. I have over 5,000 sci-fi books in my collection.. and this is as good as sci-fi gets 
 "Beyond the Down Low" by Keith Boykin is a great accumulation of background information on the topics of blacks, gays, HIV and AIDS, and their interdependence in American society. As Keith Boykin has seen and achieved a great number of things in his life, he can provide an expert look at facts from different perspectives.  From the way Boykin writes, the text sounds like an arguement and as if he was trying to prove a point. However, I don't feel it is clearly stated what that point is. That was a bit confusing. Maybe it is just Boykin's enthusiastic and passionate writing style.  Nevertheless, this is a book worth reading for a broad spectrum of audiences. The amount of information he provides really educates the reader and lets him or her make his or her own judgement of the so-called down low. With "Beyond the Down Low," Keith Boykin sheds some much needed light on the situation of black gays within their communities 
 I love history stories that read like fiction. I learned a lot in the book and in addition enjoyed the the story. 
 When you live in Mississippi, you are immensely flattered when you discover that someone has written an entire guide about your state. Although I have never understood why, the travel industry seems to have ignored the wealth of things to do here.  This book is great because it's extremely detailed and also provides the history (or what I like to call the "back story") on alot of the sights and attractions in the state.  The book divides the state into sections, giving meaty attention to each part of Mississippi. At the end of each section, Kirkpatrick provides a list with contact information for each attraction, hotel, and retail outlet discussed in the section. Bits of state trivia are also interspersed throughout the book in little shaded boxes. This helps to liven up the reading, and is fun and educational, to boot.   Living in central Mississippi, I can definitely vouch for the veracity of that section. Kirkpatrick hits all of the highlights (and some of the lowlights!).   If you're interested in visiting the REAL Mississippi, not just the casinos and the antebellum homes (though Kirkpatrick certainly covers those, too), buy this book.   
 I've been playing this with kids for about 9 years - my 4 year old enjoys it just as much as my 14 year old did years ago.  It's interesting, tho, that kids will still pull for their favorite colored snail!  Really fun without complexity of some games for preschooler 
 This is the follow up book to the 1980's best seller, "We Don't Die" also team authored by George Anderson, Patricia Romanowski, and Joel Martin. The George Anderson books written with Romanowski and Martin take special pains to provide convincing supporting evidence to lend veracity to George Anderson's discernments or psychic readings. Both Romanowski and Martin are respected journalists who apply the rigors of healthy skepticism to their subject matter. If you're looking for a flimsy debunking, you won't find it in,"We Are Not Forgotten."     Instead, you the reader, encounter page after page of transcripts from George Anderson's sessions with people seeking information from loved ones who have passed over to the other side. After reading this book, one tends not to use words like death, with the usual sense of finality and resignation.      From the transcripts of sessions, it is obvious that Anderson is not cold reading. He doesn't throw out random names and relationships hoping to score a hit. His discernments are usually precise to the point where Anderson will persist with a hint of stubborness. Anderson will often insist that the spirit coming through has given the correct name and relationship to the person undergoing a session. Other less capable mediums or psychics will refrain from insisting on the accuracy of their readings.       If you become engrossed in this book the way I did, the two hundred plus pages will go by rather quickly. You may be interested in pursuing the subject matter further with a reading of "We Don't Die" or several other George Anderson books. The stories included in the Anderson series are insightful, inspiring, and well written. George Anderson truly is one of the great clairvoyants of our age, and his readings are nothing short of remarkable 
 Although I am a die hard Baby Bjorn fan, I am not a true fan of the LITTLE potty.  It's small in design, with no removable bowl which makes it very hard to keep clean.  Save your money and upgrade to the Baby Bjorn regular potty which is well worth the money!!  We keep our little potty in the minivan for those unexpected road trip emergencies. 
 This is a non-threatening story that explains that all living things are part of a natural cycle. This simple story with colored photographs is for readers of all ages, especially early elementary. Using effectively the perspective between the balance of life and death, The Fall of Freddie the Leaf, uses the mentoring approach of an older leaf named Daniel who shows a younger leaf named Freddie that the changes experienced through life are natural and inevitable. As Freddie the Leaf and his companion leaves experience their own changes along with the passing seasons, Freddie learns that death is part of life. This understanding prepares him for his own calm and peaceful experience as he falls from his branch with the winter's snow. As a whole, our culture has great difficulty dealing with the issue of death. By using nature's natural change of the seasons as a metaphor, children are inspired to listen to, and read, this story's message. Without compromising personal cultural beliefs, children are exposed to the love and power that unites all humans in the understanding that the "end" is also the "beginning."

 This book begins with three chapters that outline how networks and network programs work. Chapter 1 is a gentle introduction to network programming in Java and explores some of the unique programs that become feasible when networking is combined with Java. Chapters 2 and 3 explain in detail what a programmer needs to know about how the Internet and the Web work. Chapter 2 describes the protocols that underlie the Internet, such as TCP/IP and UDP/IP. Chapter 3 describes the standards that underlie the Web, such as HTTP, HTML, and REST.   The next two chapters discuss two parts of Java programming that are critical to almost all network programs but are often misunderstood and misused - I/O and threading. Chapter 4 explores Java's classic I/O models which, despite the new I/O APIs, are still the preferred means of handling I/O in most client applications. Understanding how Java handles I/O in the general case is a prerequisite for understanding the special case of how Java handles network I/O. Chapter 5, explores multithreading and synchronization, with a special emphasis on how they can be used for asynchronous I/O and network servers. Chapter 6 shows how Java programs interact with the domain name system through the InetAddress class, the one class that's needed by essentially all network programs.   Chapter 7 explores Java's URL class, which enables you to connect to and download files and documents from a network server without concerning yourself with the details of the server's protocol. It lets you connect to an FTP server using the same code you use to talk to an HTTP server or to read a file on the local hard disk. Chapter 8 introduces some little known classes for parsing and rendering HTML documents that make this task easy.  Chapters 9 through 11 discuss Java's low-level socket classes for network access. Chapter 9 introduces the Java sockets API and the Socket class in particular. It shows how to write network clients that interact with TCP servers of all kinds including whois and HTTP. Chapter 10 shows how to use the ServerSocket class to write servers for these and other protocols in Java. Chapter 11 shows how to protect your client server communications using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and the Java Secure Sockets Extension (JSSE).  Chapter 12 covers the I/O APIs that were introduced in Java 1.4. These APIs were specifically designed for network servers. They enable a program to figure out whether a connection is ready before it tries to read from or write to the socket. This allows a single thread to manage many different connections simultaneously, thereby placing much less load on the virtual machine. These APIs primarily provide huge performance boosts for high volume servers. Chapter 13 introduces the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and the associated DatagramPacket and DatagramSocket classes, and Chapter 14 shows how to use UDP to communicate with multiple hosts simultaneously.  Chapters 15 through 17 look more deeply at the infrastructure supporting the URL class. These chapters introduce protocol and content handlers, concepts unique to Java that make it possible to write dynamically extensible software that automatically understands new protocols and media types. Chapter 15 describes the class that serves as the engine for the URL class of Chapter 7. It shows how to take advantage of this class through its public API. Chapter 16 also focuses on the URLConnection class, but from a different direction; it shows how to subclass this class to create handlers for new protocols and URLs. Finally, Chapter 17 explores Java's mechanism for supporting new media types.  Chapter 18 introduces RMI, which enables distributed Java applications to run across multiple heterogeneous systems simultaneously, while communicating with straightforward method calls just like a nondistributed program. Chapter 19 discusses JavaMail, which is an alternative to low-level sockets for talking to SMTP, POP, IMAP, and other email servers.   This book assumes you are an experienced Java programmer. Thus, you should be comfortable with basic AWT and Swing programming, since some of the code examples use these APIs. It is assumed that you know the basics of computer networking - how to use the Internet, what a URL is, how to FTP files, and write simple HTML. However, it assumes no prior experience with network programming. I found the book to be complete and in-depth. The code examples are plentiful, non-trivial, and well commented. I would recommend it not only as a tutorial in Java network programming but as a reference for someone who already knows the subject 
 This was a very good book.  I just kept turning the pages.  This is the first I have read by this author and I was very impressed. After about the first 100 pages it really takes off.  I am glad a friend loaned it to me.  To bad it tok me over a year before I opened it.   
 I recommend this clean movie which kept us all entertained--ages 6 to 14 and Mom as well.  We were so engrossed that we forgot to make popcorn!  First, a caveat: if you recently saw Narnia, you might think the movie is "copying"--two boys and two girls (and their toddler brother) are sent to an uncle's house in the country as their mother is a WW 1 nurse and their dad is a fighter pilot.  There are similar issues (the older brother "in charge" and the younger brother not happy about it), but the stories aren't copies of one another and didn't intend to be! They are both just movies of really good children's books.  We are big fans of E. Nesbitt, and were a bit dubious about seeing this movie. As to staying true to the original novel, there are liberalities. However, there are a number of scenes which are similar and some which are just for the movie.  The wise-cracking psammead (sand fairy) makes some amusing comments, but thankfully, none of his jokes (or anyone else's) descend into that crude humor which is so prevalent in children's movies today.   Yes, the acting is a bit weak; the kids seem to always have smiles on their faces for some reason. And the girls aren't developed very well as characters. And I never really enjoy talking puppets in my movies. But, with all that said, we still enjoyed the movie quite a bit 
 I saw this book on Reading Rainbow today, and I was enthralled by the story and the beautiful illustrations. The episode took Levar to the village the book was about and introduced us to the apprentice, now grown, being teacher to the village and his twin sons. My daughter is only a year old, but just the colors kept her attention. I look forward to when the words will have the same effect, as I'm sure they will 
 Although the book isn't quite the easiest to read, the information within is crucial for photographers and painters 
 This set of trilogy is so good that I was upset that I only managed to get my hands on Key of Light and had to search for the other two books over a few days.  I finished Key of Light in one day, even re-reading some parts as it was just facinating!  Advice - to avoid anxiety attack, you should get all three books before sitting down to read. It will be worth your while. 
 I was just really able to appreciate this film.  Sure there were some lines that I didn't like and and I was a little unclear about some plot aspects and I wished we could have seen what happens to the characters after the film ended.  But overall, I really loved the message of the film and the originality of it.  This is a film about love, sexuality, and relationships.  It was really beautiful.  Most of what I must praise highest is the acting.  Every single person was casted perfectly for what their unique talents offered.  Corazza's is a VERY believable and truthful actor.  His acting lends himself to innocence and sympathy -- just what Matt needed.  Taylor was brilliant.  She exudes power and assurance.  And she played every one of her very difficult lines absolutely perfectly.  She was perfection.  Allison was surprising convincing and excellent.  I say surprising because for a man dressed in woman's clothing, this is the first movie where I actually LIKED the character and this character was believable and not a stupid stereotype.  Shannon was real person for me.  Boyd was absolutely excellent.  She seems to be the most experienced and a clear veteran of the art.  They were so lucky to get her for this.  She's a world-class actress.    This film was just really enjoyable.  I really found the writer's (Fraser) commentary to be especially interesting.  This film was daring, original, and well-directed.  A little unbelievable at points, but enjoyable none the less.  
 I wanted to know more about this book and seem to have encountered reviewers who have treated this as a homework assignment.  One assumes you have read the book, it is not necessary to go into extreme detail and it is really in poor taste to GIVE AWAY THE PLOT in your review as was the case with one reviewer's comments.  Most unfortunate. 
 A Man For All Seasons is a marvelous period film driven by Robert Bolt's trenchant script and superb acting by Paul Scofield playing Sir Thomas Moore who must by conscience oppose the desires of King Henry the VIII (played by Robert Shaw). It is the only film in my memory that depicts the virtue of integrity with such poigancy that you'll take a look at yourself and wonder how firmly you would hold on to your beliefs when faced with dire consequences if they were asserted. You'll want to see the film repeatedly to savor its intelliegence, crisp direction by Fred Zinneman, and authentic looking sets and costumes. Among the film's gems is the music (I don't think it was ever released on cd). Undoubtedly the film is not entirely historically accurate but it does make it eminently clear what a man of integrity can be. A Man For All Seasons richly deserved the 6 Oscars it captured including best film of 1966. 
 Our seven year old son read this book quickly and enjoyed it a great deal.  He only likes to read non-fiction and this book had substanitally more text than pictures, which is not usual in non-fiction books aimed at this age range.  The book contained lots of information about life in Spain in the Middle Ages that I did not know, including some challenging information about the Spanish Inquisition and the treatment of Jews by the Spaniards of that period 
 No matter if you are going to purchase this CD to practice bellydance, just to listen to.  It is money well spent.  The beats are great! Shimmies... 
 In the ongoing struggle against spam, adding filters to sendmail is a vital ability. Sendmail is probably the most common mail transfer agent on the Internet. The book describes how the latest sendmail supports a Milter interface. So that you, as a sysadmin or programmer, can write a program, usually in C, that implements a filter of your choice.  There has been various documentation on how to do this. Often scattered throughout the Web, and at various levels of competence and detail. But finally here, we have an entire book devoted to comprehensively explaining Milter.   It should be said that the authors deliberately don't go into details of what filters you might write. That is an open ended topic which is properly your remit, not theirs.   But as a bonus, there is a superb chapter on spam. It concisely goes into explaining techniques spammers use to obfuscate their mail. You can find out why blocking spam on the basis of checking subjects is essentially useless, for example. The chapter describes methods that other books on spam rarely go into. Actually, even if you have no intention of using Milter, you may want to consider the book for this chapter alone 
 Great movie for sport and Air Bud fan Awesome effects and a nice mystery to top things up 
 Packaged neatly in this little book is a pass into the rarefied world of White House politics few individuals ever get to experience first hand.  In concise language this easy to read book brakes out policy making in the executive branch to its composite processes and walks students through three real case studies taken from the authors own experiences.  Well worth the read for students of public policy, young Hill staffers or anyone interested in an honest insight into the Clinton administration without the scandalous fluff 
 This book is great.  It covers the ordinal numbers (first, second, third and fourth) and is a fun story that kids enjoy.  My almost 3  y.o. son asks me to read it over and over and my 4.5 y.o. daughter got the concepts after the second reading.    If you are looking for a good edutainment book I suggest you can't go wrong with this one 
 It's 1961; the USSR has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the East coast of the United States for the purpose of...brinksmanship? But hold on, there is a problem; the Soviet Union is staffed with incompetents!!(one of communism's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel). The menacing black submarine is doomed from the get-go. It leaks, and it is cobbled together with substandard parts. After heading out to sea, there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits. The men receive lethal doses of radiation, but unfortunately the doctor doesn't know anything about radiation sickness...he is only giving them aspirin. Before long radiation begins to permeate the ship. The entire crew is in danger. The officers are of two minds - some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the Americans, while others want to save face for the Soviet Union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die. As the submarine becomes more and more disabled, as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking, as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby American destroyer, as the submarines's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat, the dread of the crew is really palpable. This movie was very suspenseful because I had no idea how it would end. Definitely worth your time 
 Michael Redgrave made a handful of movies, but was always thought to be the man who could be used in movies when Laurence Olivier was not available. In this movie he again gives a performance of depth and  understanding.  His other forgotten starring role was in a movie that is  explained in a new book called A THINKER'S DAMN.  Anyone interested in  Redgrave ought to check it out. It's on amazon 
 I like this book, mainly because I find I share similar tastes as as the authors. If they recommend a CD, I generally enjoy it. Their selection of the best recordings of people like Corea and Jarrett I also agree with. Whereas I have been disappointed with other publications such as the Penguin and AMG guides which have a different viewpoint.   Not surprisingly, the book is very good on the British scene and what is happening on the Babel, Caber and Provocateur labels. The UK is very interesting at the moment, with lots of young exciting players and music.        
 Alfred Stieglitz is legendary in the annals of American photography. In Stieglitz On Photography: His Selected Essays And Notes, Richard Whelan has compiled and annotated the best of Stieglitz's commentaries regarding the  power and beauty of the photograph as an artistic and interpretative  medium. Drawing from Stieglitz's exhibition reviews, travel pieces,  technical articles, and various diatribes on Pictorialism and the founding  of the Photo-Secession, Stieglitz On Photography is "must"  reading for all serious students of the developmental history and cultural  relevance of American photography 
 Shapiro has captured the essense of manufacturing management in her book.  Most corporations go around shopping for the latest panacea or silver bullet on the market.  She does an excellent job in poining out both the benefits and pit falls of each of the major trends. Shapiro does a great service to management practices by pointing out that all of these initiatives are neirther good or bad in themselves, put can be used at the wrong time with disasterous results 
 my daughter was so excited to get this kit. she loved the little pillow that she could put her tooth in so she didn't have to worry about the tooth getting lost. i loved the fact that you could store everything in the small box for keepsake. doesn't take up a lot of room. the tooth napsack could have been a little smaller i think. but still ok. the little journal for dates on losing the teeth is very nice. liked that ideal. but overall very happy with the product. years down the road my daughter will have memories of losing her teeth.  
 Annie Wilkes is off the chain. You all know that this book is about  Paul Sheldon who gets into a car accident because he was all buzzed up with don pariogone. Then this psychotic biach (Annie) takes Paul and "nurses" him if thats what you wanna call it.Then she dause stuff to him that you need to find out by reading this amazingly written book. If you've seen the movie then you stillhave to read this book it's that good 
 Danny Cox has brought his experience and enthusiasm into every page in this book.  Our Company is expanding rapidly and this is a great book to read and reread.  It's full of "ahh ha's!&quot 
 Eternity is a sweeping vision defining the plot vein started with Stapleton's Starmaker and Zebrowski's Macroworld.  Extending from the near future to the Universe's end, Greg Bear paints a vision of Humanity (extended to all intelligentlife forms)at it's best and worst, and does it with very sympathetic characters, extensive and involved plots, and ingenious predictions on technology and evolution.  Plus, The Way - a constructed, self-contained universe made by man.  Quite possibly the best Science Fiction I have read.  If you read Eon, by Bear, this is a must-read sequal that far surpasses the original 
 An interesting counterpoint to Running with Scissors, which I read recently.  As far as memoirs provide insights into the author, I would much rather have dinner/drinks with Mary Karr than Augusten Burroughs.  Somehow she seems much less self-absorbed.  Also, in addition to her great descriptions of her family dynamics and situation, she beautifully portrayed life in a small Gulf Coast town.  Though not a big reader of poetry, I'll seek out her other writing 
 I found 007-Agent Under Fire a good game, but it was too short; just 5 hours long. The missions were fun, and you get to drive the tricked out James Bond cars with the machine guns and the rockets, and a whole lot of gadgets; the watch laser, and the list goes on. The missions are fun, especially when you are driving the Soviet T-80 and using the gaulting gun with the 80 MM gun barrell killing the bad guys. The missions take you all over the world to Romania, the UK embassy in Hungary, and the list goes on. A good game, but it could of been better 
 It doesn't weigh down my hair and it smells like I stepped out of the salon 
  best info on subject ever found..history/chronology narration much appreciated. teenage recipient of this gift dvd expressed gratitude for learning abt. "Burning Man" - subject of which he was completely unaware. 
 This DVD has some problems with the soundtrack, with some of the softer conversation muffled. Still it is the same engrossing, intriguing story we saw on television when it was a new release.  I experienced the same involvement with these superbly drawn characters and story line, defined against the background of the end of the Raj. The DVD is not flawless--there a few editing bobbles--but it is a necessity for any refined collection of dramatized novels, British literature, Raj literature, or tours-de-force of acting. I found the performances of Peggy Ashcroft, Judy Parfitt, and Art Malik as enthralling as they were years ago 
 I am a big reader, but in general, I'm a big reader of short novels. I just don't handle the large ones too well, and that's why I've been slow to get to David Copperfield. I've read a lot of Dickens's other stuff, and I've loved it all. I count Hard Times and A Tale of Two Cities and Oliver Twist and A Christmas Carol and a couple of others among my favorites. I was never able to make myself read David Copperfield though.  Until the last several weeks. I decided that it would be good for me to get through the whole thing, and I must say that it was a rewarding experience.   I particularly enjoyed the comedy of the novel. It has some of Dickens's most humorous moments and characters. Mr. and Mrs. Micawber are the sort of characters you know even before reading the novel, and the novel really starts going once they appear. Mr. [...] and David's aunt provide nice moments, too.  And, of course, there's that Dickensian melodrama that we all love. That's probably why this book has been so popular through the years. David is a likeable character (particularly when he grows up), and his life definitely has its traumas and its highs. David's appealing, and it's pretty easy to become emotionally attached to the fellow as he makes mistakes and experiences triumphs and dark times. That's one thing about a thousand page novel; you get a little of everything.  There's plenty of interesting social commentary, particularly on the role of women. Dickens's philosophy on love it pretty evident, too, in the later stages of the novel, and that's pretty interesting.  So, it's a good book for all those who like the big novel, and for all those who like Dickens, it's, of course, a cannot miss. It's long but worth it 
 The book reads smoothly and contains unique ethnographic information.  The book follows a chronological order of events in the civil rights movement.  Readers who are interested in an eye witness account of the movement between 1954 and 1965 should purchase this book.  It would be appropriate for a high school educational setting 
 By far my favorite JA Jance books feature J.P. Beaumont. I enjoy her other series, but not nearly as much. This particular book was good, but not quite as tightly written as the earlier J.P. Beaumont titles, such as Until Proven Guilty, Injustice for All, or Trial by Fury.  It still grips you in the continuing story of Beaumont's life, and makes you want to hear what happens to him next...and also, of course, what new case he gets involved in solving. It is definitely worth the read 
 This is a magical book. I read it to my son and he asked me to read it to him over and over. He loved the part about about Polyphemus the Cyclops. It is a book full of stories rich with the ages. If you look into the Heavens on a starry night many of the constellations are from this dynamic book written in the pre-Christian era filled with all the Greek Gods running amok with the emotions and fates of man. This too is a favorite book of mine 
 This guy is funny!  If you do not laugh while listening to this CD, then you are dead!  If you can catch him performing in person, go!!  LONG show (over 90 minutes) and I hurt when leaving I laughed so much 
 This is one of the greatest classic in literature, the only downside is that it is a little long. You will really need some time to get through this one 
 Passionately written by a gentleman who came to respect his baseball coach almost as much as he loves the children to whom he dedicated the book.    Must reading for the coaches, teachers, scout leaders, and all those others of "influence" over the next generation.  Michael Lewis is a wonderful writer; I suspect, after reading this, an equally great parent.  I highly recommend this book to those either in the midst of or contemplating raising children 
 My father was a member of the 77th Division which fought in the Pacific.  He never talked about the war and I have always been interested in learning more about how he survived.  This book is a MUST read for anyone whose father fought in the Pacific, especially on Okinawa.  It is not a history lesson as other books are, but actual memoirs of the soldiers who fought there.  You are even given their names and brief biography.  You hear and read so much regarding the D-Day invasion and how terrible that was but after reading Operation Iceberg, you will come to understand how much worse the fighting in the Pacific was.  I find it hard to believe that anyone came home unwounded from those battles, but they did, including my father.  My knowledge of World War II has been greatly expanded after reading Mr. Astor's book. Thank you, Mr. Astor, for writing this book and for giving me some insight into what my father lived through 
 Earl Grey is supposedly the second most popular tea in the world. Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smokey flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot.  Earl Grey tea has an interesting history.  Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men.  Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea.  Tazo shows considerable expertise in the blend of this top quality tea. The black teas utilized are as the box states "the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of Nuwara Eliya, Uva and Dimbula in Sri Lanka and Assam in northeast India." They provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend. The fragrance is powerfully floral, in particular lavender, citrus, and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. The flavor of this splendid potion is rich and perfumed. A tasty sensual delight!  Earl Grey is traditionally served black, sometimes with lemon.  I prefer it with cream.  On a warning note, if you keep this tea in the cupboard for too long it will get old--the taste becomes very thin and harsh.  Brew it from fresh teabags and you won't be disappointed 
 there is no other word that can describe this movie once it is over. If you're heart is still beating from being chased through a garden maze, you definitely won't need a difibulator any time soon. I don't think I have jumped that much in all my years of exercising! Jack Nicholson knows how to play the insane like no one else! Whew! Excellent movie if you like being scared out of your wits 
 I was delighted with Pellechia's first book, "Garlic, Wine and Olive Oil" so I was prepared to enjoy his history of wine - and I was not disappointed.  It is easy to read, and I enjoy the human dimension he employs in telling the story.  Naturally, a history book includes the tales of well-known people and major events of past and present centuries, but Pellechia retells many of those stories with the twist of how the development, the trade, and the appreciation of wine was affected by those people and events.  Not what you normally hear about in history class!  The book itself is well-illustrated, with interesting sidebars. There is a personal feel to the prose and the illustrations that make the book feel special and unusual.  A good addition to my personal library, and a great gift for friends.  
 I can't think of a better technique to "smarty-pants" your way through a game of Texas Hold 'Em than what's outlined here. Let's just hope the rumors that Edmonds and Eidinow are finishing up their draft of "Spinoza's Three Card Monte" aren't simply the liquor talking 
 If you don't have the courage or money to go to a teacher, this is a great book. The exercises are easy and encouraging. Although I found that some of the exercises hindered more than opened my range, I know that not every exercise will work for every person and so I skip one here and there and move on. I did learn a great deal from this book and I would buy it again. Although I wouldn't take it as Bible, it is a great starting point. I am not an expert so I really can't give a more thorough review BUT I would recommend that you buy a few books to get more points of view and take something from each.  The biggest problem I have is that the 'for dummies' series does not sell or give replacement cd's. If you lose the CD, you must buy the entire book again. This is ridiculous. If you buy a book with a CD, make plenty of copies so that you have a back up or three. 
 Elizabeth Gilber is certainly a talent.  The tales were diverse and interesting but I felt cheeted of completeness and closure.  Each character faces his or her own pilgramage in each short story, and in the end, they are no closer than when they began.  There is no "ah hah" so this is it.  I felt each one was the begining of a to be continued serie 
 [Originally posted on 2004, July 9.]  I attempt to season some of my reviews with a pinch of levity, but that will not be the case in this instance because I find nothing even remotely amusing about this subject!   'NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON: 25 YEARS LATER' is John Stormer's 1990 update of his original classic which documents Communist infiltration of the United States government as well as many other public opinion-molding sectors of American life. Mr. Stormer conclusively shows how our long-cherished American Principles have been subverted by Communistic methodology which utilizes the press, court rulings, the labor movements, the education system, tax-exempt foundation grants, government influence, and (believe it or not) even religious publications to exert pressure from above and below in order to reconfigure our framework and adapt existing structures to accomodate Socialistic goals.   The person who tells you that this is all just paranoid delusion and innuendo unsupported by any verifiable documentation is DELIBERATELY misleading you! 'NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON: 25 YEARS LATER' is one of the most thoroughly researched books I have ever encountered during my lifelong reading addiction! The exhaustive reference section spans a full 25 pages of minuscule print that cites countless books, textbooks, articles, Congressional records, administrative reports, official bulletins, treaty protocols, sworn testimony from government hearings, and most significantly, myriad Communist publications and reviews. It's not that there is just a "mountain of evidence" to support every one of Stormer's charges - that mountain is the size of Everest!   Let me assure you that the scenario presented in this magnificent masterpiece of research is as relevant to us today as the day it was first published - this despite the "appearance" of Communism's collapse in the Soviet Union. (You should know that this democratic "false front" and even the demolition of the Berlin Wall was foretold as far back as 1982 by the top-level KGB defector, Anatoliy Golitsyn in his book, 'NEW LIES FOR OLD.' This book is still in print and so you can verify for yourself his accuracy in revealing the Communist ploy years in advance.)  Why has the United States government made a pretense of fighting Communism all the while giving aid to Socialist States; securing their infrastructure and feeding their people at American tax-payer expense? As Stormer so accurately points out on page 66: "EVERY COMMUNIST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD LITERALLY HAS A 'MADE IN THE USA' STAMP."   Think about this: Isn't just the idea that the world's great superpower could not manage to emerge victorious from the "police actions" in Korea and Vietnam simply ridiculous on its face? "Winning" was never the objective of our "leaders", and Stormer proves this beyond all doubt! Reading this book for the first time years ago and thinking about all of our service men killed overseas and their families torn apart and scarred forever, there were many times that I slammed it down in rage - really not sure that I could bear to read on. Although it's a moot point for me, if I had a son who was contemplating enlisting in the armed forces (or facing conscription), I would consider it my obligation as a responsible parent, to insist that he read John Stormer's book before making any decision. What I would give to have been able to get this book into the hands of Pat Tillman before he sacrificed his NFL career and then his life in Afghanistan! God bless and keep that noble man.   You can be sure that there are many individuals out there who DO NOT want you to read 'NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON: 25 YEARS LATER.' They are hoping that the American People will continue to sit lobotomized before the boob tube and let sleeping dogs lie. Except these dogs aren't really asleep; It is we who snooze while they plot our demise! If a self-professed Communist was to frantically insist that "Nobody should read this book!....Do not buy this book!" then that is all the confirmation that you should need in order to ascertain that, in fact, EVERYBODY should read this book, and that YOU should buy this book. I urge you to do that NOW!   To summarize: NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON: 25 YEARS LATER is the heartbreaking and nauseating truth about our government's love affair with Communism. For those who lost loved ones in the Korean or Vietnam "police actions" this book will be particularly disturbing. Without a trace of hyperbole I tell you that Five Stars does not come remotely close to doing justice to the merits of this great work. It is of nearly singular distinction and unquestionably one of the most important books I have ever read. 'NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON: 25 YEARS LATER' would still be standing if I was forced to clear my bookshelves of every political tome save three. A highlighted and well-worn copy of it should be found in the personal library of virtually EVERY true American patriot....right alongside G. Edward Griffin's, 'THE CREATURE FROM JEKYLL ISLAND.' People, we had better wake up pretty darn quick otherwise the MOURNING will soon be upon us! 
 Joseph White is an Professor in the Political Science Department of Case Western Reserve University. The 'Foreword' notes that the discussion about the future funds does not address the more important topic of productive capacity of the economy in 50 or 75 years (p.xv). Most politicians and economists have a poor record in forecasting future events (p.xvi). There are a number of reasonable options available. The word "entitlement" is used for prejudice against Social Security, which is earned and not granted. The 'Preface' explains the major parts of this book and its 247 pages of text, 64 pages of notes, bibliography, and index. One flaw in this book is the lack of a short summary aimed towards a general audience. It prevents its message from being widely received.  Chapter 1 tells of the propaganda campaign about the need to save Social Security, as if there is some horrible event that will occur in 30 or more years. The biggest expenses for government are education and Social Security, but only the latter has a dedicated source of financing. Some proposed solutions to "save" Social Security and Medicare are designed to destroy them (p.5) These schemes use ignorance and fear to sway opinions (p.8). The author points out the ignorance about the proposed changes to Social Security (p.9). Projections about the future depend on assumptions, which are based on what a person would like to see (p.11). The author suggests modest changes are all that is needed at this time. Future generations will solve future problems. The "irresponsibility" is to make changes when you don't know what will happen and do unnecessary damage (p.12). Cutting Social Security and Medicare may be good for the budget, but the government exists to benefit the people, not the budget (p.13).  The advantage of social insurance is explained (p.20). The length of life and need for retirement income is variable. You would need to save the maximum for a worst case situation. But if the money is pooled then people would be protected as a lower cost. The plan for social insurance was a reaction against the Townsend Plan which would pay for pensions out of general revenue. Doing nothing was not an option. Benefits are earned, not given, or won in gambling in the market (p.22). Page 23 explains the redistribution of benefits. Having a pay-as-you-go system also keeps payroll taxes lower (p.24). The cost of living adjustment started in 1972 [after Nixon devalued the dollar in 1971]. Another question is when to finance benefits from general revenues (p.25). [Should capital gains and dividends be taxed?]  Medicaid is given and means-tested; it is not earned. It has both state and federal features, and is less reliable since it varies as t changing income (pp. 34-35). The author points out that people pay taxes for public education even when they receive no benefits (p.36). [Yet people correctly complain against the excessive costs of public education that is paid by regressive taxes.]  Social Security and Medicare allow the retired to live with dignity and security in their old age without becoming a burden on others. The debate over Social Security is not about affordability" but of politics: what should be done (p.38).There is a hidden agenda to the attacks on Social Security, one that proponents dare not mention to the public because it is anti-human or anti-people. 
 We purchased the read with me DVD system for our 3 year old son for Christmas.Ok, so first, setting up the remote took all of mabey 10 minutes. Then you simply pop in one of the DVD's and your good to go! This system is so much fun, it really brings these familiar stories to life. My son had previously been familiar with the titles offered as we have them in the traditional book form (nothing should replace reading aloud with your children), I hope they come out with more titles soon. The illustrations are the same as the ones you will find in the books but they are animated, that is reallly entertaining. The narrators voice is very clear and nice to hear. The words along the bottom of the page light up to correspond to what the narrator is saying. The $15 dollars you will spen on each DVD is a bargain considering each dvd comes with 4 different play modes and tons of questions you and your little one can answer . My son will play with the system often and it will usually have his attention anywhere from a half hour to an hour.As someone who is studying to be a teacher I like some of the other educational aspects of the system other than just the reading benefits. When you answer a question that is wrong it will prompt you to give another answer , rather than immeadiately give the right answer. When you answer the question correctly it goes further and explains why the answer is right. This a good tool to use in conjunction with daily reading to your children. Fisher price definitely got it right 
 Courtroom 302 is a frank look at the shocking injustices built into the very foundation of the criminal justice system.  The judge and laywers portrayed are identified as some of the best of their class, and they can still be seen turning a blind eye to injustice for the sake of expediency.  A word of warning: Courtroom 302 will shake your faith in the great institution of American justice.  If you want to maintain your fragile illusions, do not read this book 
 thanks to my mom, she gave me good taste in films. I think this was the first movie I saw that made me love Peter Sellers. He was a brillant, comical actor. the movie takes place in the late 60s in New York and it centers in on 2 preteen girls that have an innocent crush on Sellers charater, Henry Orient. they follow him around and drive him crazy...but in a good, funny and innocent way. its a fun, cute, sad, silly romp of a film that pleasantly surprised me 
 I have been waiting days for this book, and it finally came today. Honestly, I expected it to have your standard sword exercises and cuts, but it contains stances and techniques that I have never even heard of, while some are familiar to me. Thanks to having a hardwood bokuto (which I also purchased off of this website), I can now incorporate new exercises into my practice. Even though Hatsumi-Sensei is a ninja, he is well-versed in the culture of the samurai and the sword as well. I recommend it to all aspiring swordsmen 
 This season was sent to replace my original set. I was happy with the service that Amazon gave me to replace the original set. It was sent in a timely fashion and it is greatly appreciated. I really enjoy the series 
 I strongly recommend you read and study this book it will change your marriage I have been so blessed by this book and always give it to friends who are struggling and newly weds. Best marriage book real tools to help you and your family 
 I have read all of Clancy, Buff, Robinson and DeMercurio. Each has his own background and style. Buff and DeMercurio, like Jeff Edwards, are ex  US Navy and they served in Submarines. As an ex enlisted Submariner I particularly appreciated Mr. Edwards including and acknowledging the existence of and contributions of the crew and not just the Officers. His exposure of the sometimes "dogmatic" approach to dealing with combat situations is far to real and troubling. His understanding of the "real politic" of governments and their leaders is spot on and a bit scary. While I might quibble with the claim that in a one on one situation the surface vessel has a two out of five chance of winning the battle, he takes great care to help the reader understand the reality of antisubmarine warfare from the surface combatent's point of view. This book is really worth reading. SubSailor 
 Like many other people, and despite having serious doubts about psychotherapy myself, I was put off by the pamphleteering tone and over-comprehensiveness of "Against Therapy". In this book, Masson reveals the reasons behind "Against Therapy", which are very sound indeed. The ways in which absolute power can corrupt a therapist absolutely are made crystal clear, and are shown most convincingly by this highly intelligent and lucid first-person narrative. It is unsurprising that Masson should have been put off therapy completely by his experiences, and a pity, as his intelligence and dedication would have made him a great reformer

 The Wind in the Willows, by Kenneth Grahame, was originally a series of bedtime stories for Grahame's son.  It is still commonly considered to be a children's book, but it is too difficult for young children to read themselves, and many older children will no longer appreciate the simple themes it covers.  I imagine that its chief appeal is to adults, although children might enjoy having some parts of the book read to them.  The characters - Mole, Rat, Badger, and Toad - are wonderful creations.  Mole, Rat, and Badger are conspicuously brave and loyal creatures.  They love the comforts of home and hearth, yet they constantly set off on one rescue mission or another without a thought to their own safety.  Toad, on the other hand, is a boastful nitwit, and it is amusing to the reader to see him brought down to size again and again.  In reading this book, you get the idea that Grahame had thought for a long time about what it is like to be an animal.  He understands how their energy ebbs and wanes with the seasons, and he writes that it is a great breach of animal courtesy to ask a favor during the winter, when everyone wants to stay inside and doze during most of the day.  In summer, though, the animals are often abroad throughout the night, and they may see the sky grow bright again before they return home.  Grahame also has wonderful intuition about animal senses:  "We others, who have long lost the more subtle of the physical senses, have not proper terms to express an animal's intercommunications with his surroundings, living or otherwise, and have only the word `smell,' for instance, to include the whole range of delicate thrills which murmur in the nose of the animal night and day, summoning, warning, inciting, repelling.  It was one of these mysterious fairy calls from out the void that suddenly reached Mole in the darkness, making him tingle through and through with its very familiar appeal, even while as yet he could not clearly remember what it was."  What calls out to Mole in the darkness is his home, and a great deal of this book is an enumeration of the pleasures of home: the snugness and familiarity, the comfort of a well-used chair in front of the fire, and the simple pleasures of the table.  Highly recommended 
 This is an excellent Quilter's resource!!  Clear concise explanations.  Beautiful photography demonstrating technique, and Diane Gaudynski's friendly down to earth attitude make this book a joy to read 
 I remember anticipating the release of this disc because it was Mary's first after her split with Puffy so I, as a fan, felt high anticipation about how the project would sound. Mary worked with a lot of different producers so it has a kind of disjointed feel to it unlike 'My Life' and subsequently 'Mary' which both just flowed so beautifully from song to song. I don't mean disjointed in a negative way either because the majority of the songs sound great, it's just that there is no real direction to this album, it just sounds like a collection of good/great songs.  Song by song:  I CAN LOVE YOU - great choice for a lead single, got my attention with the excellent beats & assist from Lil' Kim   5/5  LOVE IS ALL WE NEED -  5/5  ROUND & ROUND - great beats    5/5  SHARE MY WORLD INTERLUDE  SHARE MY WORLD - beautiful   5/5  SEVEN DAYS - one of my favorite tracks, especially loved the guitar solo work by George Benson    5/5  IT'S ON - both Mary & R. Kelly's vocals on this are terrific. I'm really surprised that I don't recall ever hearing this track on the radio, it's a great single    5/5  MISSING YOU - great soulful/gospel like feel to this song   5/5  EVERYTHING - another favorite of mine, excellent reworking of a sample    5/5  KEEP YOUR HEAD & CAN'T GET YOU OFF MY MIND - filler tracks to me I really don't like either song  GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER - really melodic beats but monotonous sound (production is excellent though)  3.5/5  SEARCHING - great use of a sample that I love (Mary must love Roy Ayers cause she's sampled more than a few songs of his throughout her career)   4.5/5  OUT LOVE - excellent remake of the Natalie Cole classic   5/5  NOT GON CRY - can't say enough good things about this track, it's pure soulful angst, pure MJB!  Beautiful    5/5  I'd definitely recommend this disc to MJB fans but to the newly initiated, get 'My Life' or 'Mary' first as they are really more indicative of her talent and flow much better than this disc.  
 I would include this album on any short list of "the best jazz albums  of all time." This is a superb quartet, recorded superbly, with Johnny  Griffin in top form on the Tenor Sax.  Monk's playing is typically  sardonic. The quartet's rendering of Monk's "Rhythm-a-ning"  includes one of the best tenor sax solos ever recorded.  Outstanding 
 I AM SO GLAD THEY PUT THIS MOVIE ON DVD! THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES! IT REMINDS ME OF QUANTUM LEAP!  RI' CHARD IS SO CUTE IN THIS MOVIE! (RICHARD) HE WAS AN ADORABLE LITTLE BOY, THAT GREW UP INTO A VERY HANDSOME MAN!  I LOVE HOW HE GOES BACK IN TIME, TO FIX HIS FAMILY PROBLEMS! 5 STAR MOVIE **** 
 While this biography is very self serving it is a good look at an interesting company. With the rise of Krispy Kreme and starbucks it is easy to forget about the largest donut chain in the country.  Rosenberg talks about his days and his focus as a coffee shop.  To Dunkin donuts the donuts are simply a side business. This mentality is fascinating and for small business trying to decide on a mission this would be well worth reading.  The book is fairly well written and it is hard to find books on this subject so if you are interested it is worth reading.   
 Read this right after reading his childhood tale, Running with Scissors.  This is more believable, more relatable and more heartbreaking.  This is the one they should have made a film out of.  At times I was proud of him, disgusted with him, sad for him, and found myself rooting for him.  A sign of a well written book.  Can't wait to read the next installment 
 Unafraid of the Dark is a beautifully written, inspirational and deeply touching book. I was unable to put it down from the moment I read the first page. I admire Rosemary and feel that she is an inspiration to all African  American women 
 I have read this mag thru and thru, and for some 20 + years now it has continued to be at the top of the crop.  It is the most superbly laid out and designed magazine with excellant content,that I have ever seen.  To be totally honest, I would much rather read and browse this any day over "Print" magazine.  This is almost like a graphic design book, that just gets published every 2 months where the best designers in the world are given each about 30 pages to just go nuts on.  I found it deep in the stacks of the university library one day and have been hooked ever since...also for those of you who can read/write japanese, german, and english you can have your pick while reading.. 
 I must agree with the Amazon reviewer who said that if you could only read one business book, this should be it.  It really should be required reading for all managers and supervisors, and definately a required read of all MBA students.   The most important advice: develop strengths, don't try to fix weaknesses. Some people will never improve in their weak areas, but can accomplish the world with their strengths. Learn to recognize and develop those strengths, and you will be managing a team that can do anything!  Jeff, JeffreyMonk.co 
     If you enjoy books that are funny, short, and filled with illustrations of animals, then The Mitten, by Jan Brett, is the book for you.  The Mitten is a short picture book about a boy, named Nicki, who loses his snow white mitten one day while playing out in the woods.  When Nicki dropped the mitten, a mole came acorss it and decided that it looked like a warm and cozy place to sleep, so it went inside.  Next, a rabbit came and decided to huddle in the mitten.  Then, a badger came, and after the badger was five more animals.  Eventually, after an    , the mitten exploded!  There is an unexpected ending, but this book will hold young readers' attention from the very beginnning.       The author definitely chose the right vocabulary and drawings for this book and age group.  Jan Brett did an excellent job of portraying the sotry with her pictures.  The simple vocabulary is perfect for children learning to read.  "Once there was a boy named Nicki who wanted his new mittens made from wool as white as snow."  This quote is a perfect example of the book's simple vocabulary.     This book is a great way for parents, gradnparents, or older siblings to bond with their children, grandchildren, or siblings.  It's a cute and funny story that will make everyone laugh.  "The force of the sneeze shot the mitten up into the sky, and scattered the animals in all directions."     Another reason that kids might enjoy The Mitten is because many kids can realte to the characters.  They might not exactly be able to relate to the animals, but many kids will be able to relate to the adventurous Nicki.  "So off Nicki went.  And it wasn't long until one of his new mittens dropped in the snow and was left behind."  Tons of children are like Nicki and are always losing things when they are having fun.     The Mitten is full of fun laughs that will be suspensful for young ones till the end.  It's easy to read and enjoyable.  So, if you are a young reader who enjoys a fun story and a good laugh, then this book is  for you.      Sorry, but the computer deleted some of the words in the review.  Sorry for the inconvenience. 
 I just finished reading this exquisite book, and have sent emails to all my friends who are educators and/or parents.  Fox writes with such passion and voice that I couldn't put the book down once I started it.  Her ideas are needed, her style is eloquent, fluent and mesmerizing.  This is a book I will read again and again, especially at the start of each new school year. What she says is as important for high school learners as for kindergarten.   She has stated so succinctly why it's essential to keep the heart in education. She shows how children can come to the love of reading, writing and thinking. Her diatribe against fill-in-the-blank worksheets is convincing.  I will give a copy to every teacher that my children will have throughout their schooling 
 The stories in this book are horribly fun to read.  Ron Carlson has a really cool sense of humor.  As a college student, it is important to read material that excites your spirit, to even out the Calculus and Accounting.   You can finish a story every night, they make excellent study breaks. Go  Hawks! 
 This is the best portrait of an artist I've ever seen.  I was completely entralled by the film.  Because Warhol was both tremendously inventive and horribly cruel, I alternately felt a sense of awe and disgust.  Warhol's genius and callousness are both fleshed out.  Despite the turbulent content of the film, I was simply exhilerated throughout.   Having watched this excellent film, I feel a greatly enriched appreciation for Warhol's art---a sense of what it said, how it worked, and how it became a cliche.  (I was particularly ill-informed about Warhol's films, which were discussed in great detail.)    The Factory--where Warhol worked (but seldom played) and where transvestites, drifters, and creative spirits intermingled--is featured in healthy portions.  This locale comes across as one of those rare places in history where the geist of a era is spatially concentrated.  Here, in this one extraordinary place of production, Warhol and others fomented art and a vision of a post-Fordist world.  This film is essential viewing (like the Weather Underground or Berkeley in the Sixties) for those who want to ingest and comprehend the paradigm shift of the "1960s."    Warhol's cruel indifference to the self-destruction of those around him is critically revealed.  While some in the Factory drank and drugged themselves to death, Warhol passively watches, always remaining cool, detached, and voyeuristic.    The attempted homicide on Warhol, his commercialism, and his later years are all mentioned.  I would fault the film for not showing Warhol speak on film more often, for not really considering his cooptation by capitalism, and for skipping over his influence in art and in popular society.    I must admit though, that the film is brilliantly executed, and well worth your time and nickel.  
 This is a funny and touching movie at times.  I saw the American re-hash of it but it didn't traslate as well to baseball.   As this is Nick Hornby's autobiography how could it.  He's English and an Arsenal fan.  It's a shame this movie will not be seen in the States.  Whoever made the decision to change it to an American version did a gross mis-service to this film.  I have found American audiences to be very receptive to British movies 
 I ordered this book and tell ya what.  It has the best information I've seen yet that indicates, through scientific research that THC helps stop or reduce pain...something the herb consumers have known for a long time.   Interested in medicine such as Marinol for pain?  Get this book, then give  it to your doctor.  THC Delta-9, is now schedule III, prescribable by  doctors for "other than approved label use"... 
 Joseph Campbell would be proud of this coming of age hero story.  Haru (Chris Farley) is a ninja school dropout. He still maintains a positive attitude. He gets an opportunity to help a Sally a lady in distress (Nicollette Sheridan). His mission will eventually take him to the hills of Beverly. Sensei (Soon Tek Oh) is like a father to him. Sensei realizing he can not sway Haru from his mission sends another ninja Gobei (Robin Shou) who is Haru's spiritual brother to quietly help.  On this mission Haru, Gobei, and Sensei learn more about themselves. 
 Having not studied classically, the JS Bach book has helped my technique enormously and I can already see and feel improvements from playing the pieces.  Enjoyable and interesting studies to play.  Definitely a must buy for all bassists whatever style.  Guaranteed fast results...lets see what my jazz colleagues think of my solo pieces now! Go buy it now 
 This idea book for early education teachers is rich in suggestions for designing effective and appealing teaching-and-learning activities. Focused on pre-kindergarten, the ideas and activities are easily adaptable to the primary grades, and indeed the book prepares the teacher-reader to extend  the methods into a variety of local needs and opportunities.  Because the  authors involve parents in their teaching suggestions, Picture This will  stimulate parents with engaging ideas that can be used at home. Entz and  Galarza involve the newest technology, but based on the best basic  principles -- teacher and students together in meaningful activities,  developing language through dialogue, and developing complex thinking  through joyful play and work.  A wonderful book 
 Walk 2 Moons is about a 13-year-old girl, Sal, going to Idaho with her grandparents to visit her mother that left Sal and her father a few years earlier.  To pass the time away, Sal tells her grandparents the story of her friend Phoebe Winterbottom.  Like Sal, Phoebe's mother left and they think a lunatic kidnapped her.  There are 2 stories in this book, Sal's story and Phoebe's story. This book is about love, loss and starting over.  You will love this book.  I tell everyone to read it.  The book has many good quotes to live by in it.  Read it 
 This play was a particular relief of your average Shakespeare play, in that it is not a deep philosophical piece of literature. I personally loved reading this play and it does have many interesting values and lessons that one could learn and apply. In several instances I found myself laughing out loud just reading the script. Over all I would say that this is yet another one of Shakespears timeless classics that can still very easily be applied in almost every persons life today. Shakespeare wrote this play, as I believe, to show people how stupid they are and the foolish things that they do when they are in love. I personally do not really enjoy the drama of a love story, but this is a whole different animal.The characters in the story are completely normal citizens of an almost care- free society, but, when love comes knocking at their door they transform into completely zaney lunatics. The characters are, however, people and react in different ways. No matter how they do react it is a far cry from what they normally would do. Indeed, this story shows someone to what great lengths they will go in the name of love. For instance, Benedict, one of the main characters, falls in love with the main female and all of a sudden becomes a quiet, softspoken gentleman, who now cares about his appearance. Whereas before he was an opinionated man, who used sarcasm to get his points across. The story does portray very well what love is, different types of love, and how it is reacted to. This play has taught me many things, especially about women, but most of all it has taught me that there are two very specific types of love and that a person should experience both. One type of love, presented by Beatrice and Benedict is the real heart felt one, where both people know and care for one another and the other was demonstrated by Hera and Claudio. This type is known as "puppy love." Each couple represents their type of love very well and has helped me to realize which sort of love that I have, and have had with other people. This book is well worth whatever they are asking for it. If you really apply yourself you can get alot out of this story. The storyline is very good and lets you feel that you are a part of the story, like you know something that the other characters do not know. It is so involved that I often wanted to strangle some of the characters and tell others some great secret. Then I felt like a retard and stopped myself. This is a very light read and though it is mildly difficult to understand it is easy to understand what point Shakespeare is trying to get across. This story is so good because it teaches so many lessons without having this heavy blanket of philosophy shrouded around it. I would recommend this play to anyone who just simply enjoys a good read. If by chance you read this review, then realize this, I am not exagerrating of making any of this stuff up. This is a really good story without the deep thoughts and questions of life. So, in conclusion, this is just one person talking, but READ THE PLAY! It is really good and worth it, but you do not have to take my word for it 
 I have a pond business, and I not only keep koi myself, but I have read several books on koi.  This book is absolutely incredible.  It has just enough of everything to be educational without being overwhelming.  The material is presented in an easy to understand format, from the origins of the hobby to the present, and the pictures are spectacular.  Each variety of koi is beautifully represented, and the chapters on nutrition and water quality are enlightening.  I loaned my copy to a friend and have not gotten it back yet 
 I found this book to be very helpful. Security is a huge issue with going wireless.  Anyone interested in this book should consider taking a look at www.lucidlink.com -- there's a flash demo on wireless hackers. This demo highlights the issues that people ignore when they don't secure their wireless networks.  Its definitely worth a look 
 An unconventional book for old baldie. Half of this book is very deep writing on the nature of reality and the other half is a description of Ken running around with his new girlfriend. Half the substance of this book has already appeared on the Shambhala website. Ken spills the beans that he does and has for some time experienced the ultimate non-dual state of consciousness 
 I first heard this story over a radio broadcast. It was just beautiful. Every scene was breathtaking. It haunted me for years. As an adult now, I recently ran across the book and read it. Although, it was good, it didnt quite capture the beauty that the radio broadcast had. I was a bit disappointed but it was a good story 
 Book arrived on time in excellent condition. I was very pleased 
 Gore doesen't make a movie, but this one had enough when it was needed, but talk about a great slasher movie.  Awesome twist ending, great atmosphere, great scares, cool killer = awesome slasher film.  Highly recommended 
 GMAT 800 is a very popular book. Whoever at Kaplan came up with the name ought to get a raise and an immediate promotion to the head of the marketing department. Everybody wants an 800, and we'd all like to think that working really hard through the materials in one book will get us there.  Of course, that's ridiculous. This book claims to have the "hardest problems," and while it has a few, that's just not true. A better title would be "GMAT 720." That's not to say the book isn't worthwhile. It probably does have more difficult problems than any other popular book on the market--it certainly contains more than any other Kaplan book or the Official Guides.  I am disappointed, however, with the way material is distributed in this book. The hardest questions on the GMAT aren't equally divided among every content area: there's more difficult Data Sufficiency than Problem Solving and more probability than algebra. However, there are only a handful of probability questions in this book, and the Problem Solving/Data Sufficiency split is heavily weighted toward the former. There are indeed more Problem Solving questions on the GMAT, but high-scoring students aiming for the top need Data Sufficiency practice more.  If you are scoring 650 or better and aim higher, this is a great book to have. However, don't put too much stock in the tips--they aren't explained terribly well, and in my opinion they aren't even the best methods to do some of their problems.  If you can comfortably do every question in this book in a reasonable amount of time, you may not get a perfect score, but you'll do very well 
 There are 4 different stories  in  this  book. My favorite  was Little Bear's Mermaid. I liked when  Little Bear saw the  mermaid when his mom  and  dad  were sleeping. I also liked when Little Bear went fishing. Other kids will like this book  because it has many  stories in it 
 this is a great pack of music-all the original songs.  my little ones weren't thrilled with some of the really "old" songs.  
 A friend had recommended "Hairball" to me, and it was one of those books that I absolutely devoured. MacKenzie's delicate tightrope of allowing just enough of the corporate bureaucracy to balance your freedom-loving creativity to keep you in orbit (hence the metaphor) is good reading for both bureaucrats and creatives. MacKenzie understands that both sides need each other to truly accomplish something in business or in life 
 I am confused by the other reviews.  The fan makes some noise when on, but is not noticably loud by any means.  It is small in size, but is a powerhouse.  Our living room is very large - over 400 sq. ft. - and this fan moves the air around it and does a great job cooling it down quickly.  I'm buying a second one for the bedroom 
 This is my favorite cookbook by far.  The Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe produces cookies that look and taste just like the full-fat variety.  
 great book, insightful,everything you want to know about the band is all here, review is done per song, get it and you will not regret it.. 
 Uno de los mejores libros modernos de Cuba y de AL., un monumento al lenguaje, al humor y a la nostalgia. 
 This novel was published in 1945 and tells the harrowing tale of the Helianos family in Athens during the German occupation of Greece. Nikolas Helianos is a middle-aged part-owner and editor of a publishing house. He and his wife have a ten-year-old daughter Leda and a twelve-year-old son Alex. Their twenty-year-old son Cimon died in a battle at Mount Olympus in 1941. Mrs Helianos has reached the point of desperation of war when nothing else matters except the survival of her loved ones. Nikolas Helianos, a sedentary and philosophical man, does not participate in the underground or any sort of organised resistance to the occupiers of Greece. His relatives let him know that they consider him a coward and he is therefore particularly despondent when his family have to take a German officer, Ernst Robert Kalter, to live in their apartment. Nikolas sees that this is bound to bring disgrace as things stand between him and his kinsmen and he knows that it is the weak who are timid and conciliatory. Now in the actual physical presence of Kalter he is less than ever able to correct his character although he knows how deeply his wife hates the invaders of Greece since they took her first and best child's life. But little does Nikolas know how this forced confinement with the enemy is to turn out in fact and how the heroic Helianos' are later to speak of him, if not a true hero, at least a martyr. The serenity, moderateness and lack of sensation of the plot are worthy of a true Greek tragedy. The protagonists are conducting a psychological war against the enemy, building interior defences behind the mask of obedience and submission like walls to protect their lives 
 Man I got to give it up to this dude Trey brought to the table raw emotion and passion for his first cd. When  I first heard gotta make it  it made me say who is this dude his voice is just real.

 I have never purchased a tower fan before so I have nothing to compare to, but I would say this is a good fan, not great, but good. It does move a ton of air. Maybe even too much, I don't put it on a higher speed than 1 because the 2nd and 3rd speed is very strong and blows papers and other things all around the room. The ionizer I use very little. It gives me a headache, and I have heard nothing but negaitive things about ionizers so I don't use it, but that is not why I purchased this fan anyway. The main reason I chose this fan over other tower fans was for looks. I love the wood on the front, and it looks very pleasing to the eye, unlike most fans. I think one of the worst parts of this fan, unlike previous reviews, is the noise. The fan itself makes little noise but the air it pushes around makes a lot of noise, even at low speeds. It is not something terrible, and can sometimes be relaxing, almost like the sound of a constant breeze or wind, but can sometimes get distracting/annoying Overall I would recommend this fan to anyone who wants to buy a fan with ionizer and great looks. If the ionizer and looks aren't important to you I might go with a cheeper fan 
 This book consists of some interesting recollections from Efraim Halevy, who served as the director of Israel's Mossad.  We readers see how the First Gulf War, in 1991, Israel fared poorly.  Yes, the United States helped defend Israel from Iraqi missile attacks.  However, Halevy makes the point that most knowledgeable Israelis "did not believe that the United States was doing its best to apprehend the missile launchers" and for that reason, many Israelis are very suspicious of how much help the United States will ever give Israel should its survival be at stake.  Israel did indeed agree not to join in the attack on Iraq, which may have saved the coalition against Iraq but the author shows that this did Israel very little good.  While Iraq, a serious enemy of Israel, was indeed weakened, Israel quickly came under severe pressure from its friends to appease its remaining enemies.  Israel has always needed peace, and this has made it susceptible to bogus offers of peace.  Halevy explains how this affected negotiations that involved covert channels.  As he says, rather than being a way to discuss issues regarding Israel's future, keeping Israel's interests in mind, the covert talks "evolved into a strategy designed to enable the devoted negotiators to engage in dreams of peace rather than to confront the true facts of life and to grapple with them."  There is a long and interesting section on how Israel and Jordan managed to sign a peace treaty.  And we also see what Halevy thinks of several famous people of the region.  One is the notorious Yassir Arafat, who Halevy mentions was a "compulsive liar" who "would never honor a commitment and rarely would have anything but contempt for his peers."  I remember being flabbergasted by the fact that rather than arresting, trying, and executing this thug, leaders of Western nations often showed esteem for him.  But Halevy says that Arafat did pay a political price in 2000 and 2001 for refusing to make a deal at Camp David and then for lying about the Karin A arms smuggling to the president of the United States.  Once again, I'm shocked that it took all this to discredit such a horrible person.  We also see Halevy's puzzlement at Israel's acceptance, even under pressure, of the infamous "road map" proposed by the quartet of the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations.  This document "was deemed a nonstarter and a real danger to Israel's interests for a variety of reasons."  And these reasons included allowing the quartet to determine if the Arabs had fulfilled their obligations on issues such as ending terror.  That would pretty much let the Arabs do what they pleased.    In this book Halevy often makes the point that one ought to honor one's word and build up one's credibility.  I agree.  And I think that means needing to resist pressure to make agreements that one can not or will not fulfill.    I enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it. 
 A controversy on which David Friedrich Strauss dared to express a strong personal opinion as a direct challenge to religious doctrine might easily be imagined by religious readers of this book.  Those who chose to defend Strauss during his lifetime as a scholar who rightly reflected the thought of their day merely fall into a pattern that had already been described in scripture.  Since the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden was from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the only surprising thing is that Strauss could get onto so much trouble on an issue which was obviously just theological, if having an end of the world as a day of judgment is merely a religious issue.  I might be confused, but a close look at his method of writing reveals a scholarly intent to examine various views that have already been expressly condemned in the scripture. In his search for a scoffer already condemned in 2 Peter iii. 3 f., Strauss referred to "the Wolfenbuttel Fragmentist. No promise thoughout the whole scriptures, he thinks, is on the one hand more definitely expressed, and on the other, has turned out more flagrantly false, than this," that anything is ever subject to judgment. Annotations to the Text on Section 115 observe, "Here we may observe an interesting contrast between Strauss and Reimarus (the Fragmentist)." The contrast that is noted involves a close reading of the first paragraph of Section 116, in which Strauss supposes that Jesus himself expected to do as his apostles said he would: "it follows that in this particular he was mistaken." The terrible error of the scoffers condemned here is their belief that "all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation." The irony which is usually lost in the discussion of these issues is that those who expect the world to become any more modern in its approach to this kind of problem are the most likely to be disappointed at what happens next. Is anyone betting on what that will be 
 This is a little gem of a book, 50 brief chapters describing how 50 creative individuals chose to celebrate their 50th birthdays, from grandiose to modest, with a gang of friends or alone.  I'm giving copies as  birthday gifts to family and friends turning 50 - or 40 or 60.  Any  birthday can be an occasion to rejoice 
 This book starts with a story about Masai culture and also an introduction to how to say their numbers.  What really fascinated me were the facts in the back.  It tells you about Tanzania, the Masai culture, some words in their language and also a little about how they name their children.  I love learning about African culture so I absolutely loved this book 
 I read excerpts of this in university, and then purchased the book as it was so compelling.  I have never read anything that comes close to really giving one a true account of the soldier's experience in the First World War.  The descriptions are poetic and profound, and the book puts it together in a manner that conveys the nuances of the war in ways no film or interview can - not any that I've ever seen anyway.  There are still passages that stick in my head (years later) because they are so vivid and eye-opening - more so than anything else I've read or seen on the MANY documentaries and films and research I've done about this time.  If you're doing research on this period - this is an excellent book.  A good companion is Siegred Sassoon's Memoirs of an Infantry Officer (much more factual than the embellished Robert Graves' book Good-bye to All That.  This is worth every penny and something you'll refer to again and again if you're a history buff and like to read 
 Matthew hit the nail on the head when he wrote:  "This two CD set is highly recommended for Piaf fans (as if they didn't know that already), fans of French classic vocals and fans of international music. Thank goodness Edith Piaf shared her talents with us while she lived amongst us--fans of the arts are infinitely better off because of Piaf's substantial contributions to the arts."  The Piaf legend will live forever and should. I, too, recommend the Carnegie two-cd set. It's enthralling from start to end.   Piaf, Garland and Minnelli...the world will never see women performers like these again.  Great reveiw, Matthew!   
 We took this book on a camping trip last weekend in North Mississippi and were able to identify every tree that we attempted to.  This is a VERY GOOD field guide 
 When I read this book I never put down the book before finishing a chapter (which usually happened to be chapterS). It's a real dazzling novel that made me crying, smiling, wondering and holding my breath until the end of the story. Trust me, when you read this novel you'll find all of your emotions emerge to the surface.   Though I was kinda dissappointed with the ending, which for me looks like Ha Jin wanted to finish the novel ASAP that he missed to include a strong ending like he did in WAITING, but overall the novel is a great book to read and is still pleasant to read all over again 
 I finished this rather long book in only 2 days, getting little sleep, because I was on the edge of my seat trying to see if Graff could meet Prince Charming, and was riveted by her sometimes depressing, sometimes hysterical dating tales.   Graff details many years of her dating and relationships, which necessarily include some of her career and family issues, which I personally found to be enjoyable and touching.  But, the dating is the main course. Some of the most memorable stories? 1) When Graff pretends to be Christian so that her new Jewish boyfriend gets to feel like a badboy for dating a Shiksa; 2) Graff's mixup from the personals column where she grabs the wrong man at the meeting place; and 3) the time she goes on a long weekend in New England with a boyfriend, and as she is contentedly relaxing in the car on the drive home, he commences to tell her that, all in all, the weekend wasn't worth it, because he had to spend too much money, and proceeds to count down his expenditures. Doh!  The other thing about this book that I liked is that there isn't a nice, pat ending. Like life! If you are tired of dating, you will find a lot of support, and some good laughs, in this book 
      Luke Swank (1890-1944) was a photographer of the 1930s. Up until 1930, he was a used-car salesman in his hometown of Johnstown, PA. Five years later, photographs of his were being shown at an exhibition at the New York Museum of Modern Art. Unlike Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange, Swank's photographs did not aim to portray the trials and anguishes, or the rural or industrial ruin of the Depression. Although the viewer cannot help but see Swank's photos in some respect through this historical and social lens. Swank's works are recognized as being of the 1930s from the clothing of the individuals, cars, buildings, incidental advertising in the scenes, and the equipment, towers, etc., of the factories. Besides mostly regional photographs of western Pennsylvania including Amish, farm buildings, plain rural people, and steel factories, the characteristic element of Swank's photographs is the varying pitches of darkness, or shadows. One hundred and forty plates of photographs of this fine photographer grouped into subjects such as Steel, Circus, Rural Architecture and Landscape, and others following the front matter of a biographical essay and one on each of the subject groups of the photographs

 TRIUMPH is the least Jackson-esque record they ever recorded together.  Just a look at the cover, with its simple black and white picture of the guys, all donning sweaters.  The cover is reminiscent of their THIRD ALBUM ten years before, with their faces all crowded together (only in color).  The reason this record is different is largely the arrangements.  Having collaborated with several outside musicians and arrangers, notably members of 80s rock act Toto, the Jackson sound is more funk-Y and not funk-AY.  Polished, smooth, very synthesized for the first time.  1980 saw the same thing happen musically to Stevie Wonder on his HOTTER THAN JULY; a very polished, slick album, seemingly more mainstream by intent.  This is true here also.  "Can you feel It" fits the Jacksons' musical theme of power anthems of love and peace across all people.  Aside from that, several tracks ooze distrust and fear in relationships ("Wondering Who," "Walk Right Now," "Time Waits for No one," "This Place Hotel," "Your Ways").  Though "Walk Right Now" flopped as a single, it's an energetic and catchy romp.  "Can You Feel It" also did poorly as a single, though its influence lives on as a highly-sampled song to this day.  "This Place Hotel" and "Lovely One" were the Top 40 hits from the album, though not nearly as popular as some of their previous "Destiny" or future "Victory" hits.  Unlike Destiny, however, this album was their most unified group effort in terms of songwriting, producing, and singing.  At times too glamorous, but overall a stand-out, unique Jackson experience 
 The Creature has a good reason for wanting Julia Adams for his own! She wears this hot bikini thoughout most of the movie, revealing much of her legs and figure. A dicription of her throughout the movie would be, Long black beautiful hair, small tight frilly bikini revealing her breast figure, most of back is naked , and so are shoulders. The bathing suit comes up short on her hips revealing both legs. Barefoot throughout the whole movie. You might say half naked! If you are looking for a movie with true American beauty, watch Julia Adams in {The Creature From the Black Lagoon 
 Although this book was written many years ago, it rings true for today's issues.  The book is made up of multiple (25 or so) mini essays, each about 5-10 pages long.  The book has a clear and logical philosophy that is consistent.  Its' basic premise is that pure capitalism is the first and only moral system for man.  This is because capitalism equals freedom which frees a man from coercive oppression, and that man can only create wealth and new ideas when free to use his mind.  The book states that the US briefly came close to pure capitalism in the 1700 and 1800s, but is now heading to fascism, as the state leaves property in private ownership, but the state controls output and use of the private property.  This book is the best I've read in several years, because it helped me unify my outlook on several fronts (political, economic, legal, social, etc) into one grand, consistent theory.  I think this book will appeal to liberals and conservatives alike.  Both are damned in this book by Rand, but I think the left, right, and center will recognize parts of Rand's philosophy that are dear to them too.  Read it for yourself to see, the book is cheap.  
 This novel was written as a looking glass into the life of one Jane Eyre.  Welcome to her thoughts, her advice, and descriptions of her beliefs.  But before you venture off, keep on the look-out for the contrast that exist in her thoughts compared to your own.  By finding contrast you will observe some of the similiarities in her thinking to your own. "listen, then, JaneEyre, to you sentence: to-morrow, place the glass before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faith-fully, without softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing irregularity, write under it, "Portrait of a Governess, Disconnected, poor, and plain."  In the novel you come to understand Jane as a strong person with even stronger beliefs that she lives by.  You now get a feeling of the contrast of her life.  By re-reading the line notice the way she judges and punishes herself for what she finds fualty in her life.  An entire novel is created around these constraints and contradiction.  You may come to understand a small portion of yourself through Jane's contrasting life 
 I really loved the movie, is fascinating. I got myself almost crying because of the perseverance of lorenzo's parents. I think that faith is everything, without it there's nothing...me must trust in something to achieve our goals...it's vital! This movie shown us that beyond every sad situations there's always a hope! His parentes were very strong and fantastic. They should be un example for the other ill chill's parents. Its important to have faith...it's important to us to fight for our believes and wishes. I need to fight against our fears and problems. We need to be strong. Kisses, Patrci 
 Of course this album does not rank up there with Haggard's early albums, but then again no album of any country singer does. If you are going to judge these songs by the standard of "Today I Started Loving You Again" or "Okie From Muskogee" you will think they are subpar songs. If you sit back and listen to the music, it is highly enjoyable 
 Find the executive that made the decision to leave off the incredible version of "The Times They Are A Changin'"  by that adorable young lady --- in favor of "My Back Pages" sung in Japanese --- and FIRE HIM! This CD is great and at the price I paid ($4.00) from an Amazon partner I have no right to complain.  But to me, that is one of the songs to be included in the CD.  After all it was good enough to use in the trailer.....WHERE IS IT SONY/COLUMBIA????? After being accustomed to hearing Bob sing his songs for so long, the differing versions by other artists took a little getting used to for me, but I kinda like them now.  Plus the songs Bob does are terrific and "Dixie" and "Diamond Joe" are infectious - you'll find yourself singing or humming long after the song is over.  Get this CD - a rare enjoyable soundtrack ... and at a good price too 
 from this point on, fellini stopped being a director and became an adjective. long and episodic, this movie takes on the paparazzo and celebrity symbiotic love/hate. now to some today that might seem pretty standard, but this WAS half a century back. i can imagine what audiences felt back then! and of course, this IS the movie that made marcello mastroianni into a household name, and for that alone it deserves its praise. fellini would go on to top it, but nothing he did after could have come about if not for this seminal motion picture.  
 It took me almost three weeks to read, but wow! What a fantastic book! All the things I ever wanted to know about the excesses of the rock lifestyle. I was particularly intreeged to find out about plaster-casting, the Rolling Thunder Review and the true story of the death  of Tupac Shakur. My girlfriend is half way through it now and she thinks the same. Not enough sex for me, maybe too many drugs, but overall a wicked book 
 Surprisingly decent sound for something in this price range!  And loud enough to fill an ordinary room with sound; hard to believe it runs off of a 9-volt battery.  You can also plug in a Walkman headset.  In contrast, the Pocket Rock-It costs more and is headset-only; no loudspeaker.  The three knobs on top are volume, tone, and distortion.  It comes with a fresh battery and it has a belt clip so you can wear it.  It's a good value and takes up very little space.  I kinda like the nostalgic pastel colors, like a blast from the past 
 (This review is for the Criterion Collection release of this dvd -- not for the Image Entertainment release that many other reviews here refer to.)    "Bicycle Thieves" (as it is wisely retranslated from the Italian for this new Criterion release) is one of the few "perfect films" -- by which I mean a film that is in its own way just as it should be, lacking nothing, the kind of film where even apparent missteps tend to contribute indelibly to the overall impression of a film in which nothing could have been changed without damaging the film.  Take, for example, the scenario that instead of an unknown day laborer in the role of Antonio, de Sica had gone with David Selznick's suggestion of Cary Grant (which was a condition for the film getting funded through American studios).  I have no doubt that this would have remained an interesting film, and that Grant would have done an admirable job -- but it would have been a totally different film and would have lost the fragility and vulnerability and delicacy (combined with hardness and objectivity) that make this film so precious.  We can all be grateful that De Sica chose to wait for an Italian investor who allowed him to make the film the way he and Zappatini had planned.  Without giving away anything of the plot, I will say that the conclusion of the film is one of the most powerful I have seen -- and carries an emotional weight that is earned rather than manipulated, and that can be compared only to a very few films: Chaplin's City Lights and Kiarostami's Close-up are the only films that come to mind.  De Sica strikes a very delicate balance between realistic depiction of the harsh realities of life in postwar Rome, and a humanistic vison of the resourcefulness of individuals in the face of hopelessness and the enduring power of empathy, forgiveness, and love.    The film looks better than ever on this new Criterion edition -- it seemed to me that a few shots were a bit washed out but I can only assume that is due to the condition of the available negatives.  Spots and dust and other imperfections seem to have been removed entirely, and the subtitles are quite good and easy to read.  The film alone would make this set an essential one, but the booklet (containing some excellent essays, including a very illuminating essay by Andre Bazin) and attached documentaries (one on neorealsm, one on screenwriter Zappatini, and one on De Sica) make this set as a whole like a master course on one of the undisputed masterpieces of cinema.  
 Love the cd.. I am a Huge Journey and Steve Perry fan. This shows how great and why Journey is still the best band. Why are there no more good bands left. Miss Them 
 This is the same book my grandmother used (pre-revision), the one she marked with all the birds she saw in our local area. The book is very easy to use, and I can copy grandma's notes from one to the other 
 Mr. Williams has done a fantastic job of clearly and effectively laying down the foundations of the Mahayana movement.  This movement, arguably the most colorful of the incarnations of Buddhist thought and theory, has a  convoluted past, and Mr. Williams has expertly shown the reader the origins  of the Mahayana and the origins of modern Buddhism.  The only criticism  that would in any way deter the reader from thinking this work to be one of  the definitive in the doctrine is William's unfortunate tendency to mix his  opinions which are for the most part religiously based, with philosophical  quandries.  Mr. Williams is the European Secretary for the International  Association of Buddhist Studies, and I feel as such his opinion surfaces on  several issues, most notably in the chapter on the Saddharmapundarika  Sutra.  The educated reader, or at least the reader able to assimilate  William's position, can, however, easily overcome the minor references to  academia based on faith rather than empirical knowledge.  All minor biases  aside, Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations is a superior work when  compared to many mainstream texts used in Buddhist study, which tend to be  more esoteric, or treat only specific facets of the huge diaspora that  spawned Buddhist practice in so many countries.  Mr. Williams has produced  a great work of fantastic merit in regards to understanding Mahayana  Buddhism, and should be lauded for his work which makes, in my humble  opinion, a stupendous read 
 I live in Oh and bought the book in OH.  I have not figured out how to tell which state the book is for.  I can tell you that everything matches with what I know.  It is excellent! It includes lots of good practical information.  I grow Blueberry, Red and Black Raspberries plus the garden vegtable and fruit plants 
 I hate when people degrade this novel because they expect in their little buttercup-brains that Lucie Manette is going to have a musket-fight with Mme. Defarge or Alexander Manette will murder Lucie...it's an historical novel. And like all classics, they became classics because they showed insight into the human nature and soul. The first two books develop the plot and help the readers to develop and love or hate the characters, through a slow pace. In the third book, Charles Dickens makes a point of looking into human nature with his world-famous magnifying glass and wraps up all the plots. The pace picks up and we figure out what loyalty is. I am absolutely positive that the only part that these foo-foo heads like was when Ms. Pross beats up Mme. Defarge. 
 Las Rubias del Norte of Brooklyn make wonderful music that takes the listener on a pleasant journey through past popular styles that our grandparents would surely recognize, all the while making it new through the unforced, unfiltered purity of the delivery of lead vocalists Allysa Lamb and Emily Hurst. These two weave pure magic from their hoary catalogue of ancient rumbas, Cuban pop hits, and dusty old cowboy tunes. Against lithe arrangements from the band their light pure sopranos twine and trill like spilled silver. This is their first record, self produced, but it doesn't sound like it. They've obviously been paying their dues and honing their very special sound and songbook. The only reason for the lack of a fifth star is the relative brevity of this recording clocking in at around 30 or so minutes, that and that one of the tracks unwisely turns the vocal over to one of the guys in the band. An upcoming release is soon to follow as they show signs of outgrowing the tiny Brooklyn bar where they have been a fixture. They've got a lot of great old songs up their sleeves and the band supports our two angels superbly. Watch 'em. They're gonna make it 
 "...I think that this is the great untold story to the world. It is sublime. It is arguably some of the most beautiful and poignant animation ever created..." - Richard Taylor, Weta Workshop.  There is not much that I could mention here which has not been said many times before, but the TV series and movies combined are among the best on offer in any genre.  A masterpiece, albeit flawed.  Hauntingly beautiful, disturbing, thought-provoking and terrifying, all at the same time.  Definitely not for younger viewers.   That being said, I am sad to report that the English release of the films "Death and Rebirth" and "The End of Evangelion" were so poorly done that I do not believe there is yet a definitive English translation to be had (unless you count the original "fan subs" by Bochan Bird).  It is clear listening to the commentaries that these films were not taken at all seriously or treated with the respect they deserved.  The English director admits to adding campy sound-effects and alternative (incorrect) "humorous" dialog for her "own personal amusement".  Parts of the translation sound as if they were made by an immature teenager with a childish sense of humour rather than a professional translator.  One might suspect that an attempt was made to turn this mature art-piece into a more stereotypical cartoon aimed at a younger and less discriminating audience.  The commentary offers little in the way of real insight, having very little to say about the underlying philosophies or symbolism.  Ignorance abounds, and catch phrases such as "that's Freudian" substitute for real understanding.  The producers took little care to spell check the subtitles and even invented words at times ("resonation" instead of "resonance").  If you have any understanding of, or fondness for this series at all, the commentary is beyond immaturity, it is infuriating.  Serious fans of this work will be tempted to purchase the newly remastered and magnificently restored versions from Japan and subtitle their own (the English releases are not the remastered versions and are not high quality video transfers).  For everyone else, this release is "better than nothing", but it should be remembered that it is a poor translation in parts, and that anything that seems childish, stereotypical or cliché are artifacts of translation.  I rate this product 5 stars solely on the basis of the quality of the original films, and without regard to the production standards of the English translation 
 I enjoyed this book, even though it is out of date. I don't know for sure whether there was a conspiracy to keep the scrolls out of the hands of anyone who wasn't part of a small, elite group of Catholics, but it sure seems like it. There's really no other explanation for why all the scrolls were not released, not even to highly qualified scholars, and one excue after another kept them hidden for far too long. Some of those Catholic keepers actually felt like they owned this history.  For the "International Team" to insist that the scrolls are pre-Christian is insane. They were no doubt written in the 1st century, and possible some were written in the 2nd.  I have a different picture of the peace loving Essenes after reading this. I'd like to see an update. 
 This book was very insightful into the many forms of psychic attack. When I first saw the title I assumed it was about witchcraft and black magic, but quite the contrary. As far as Dr. Goldbergs techniques, I can attest to their helpfullness first hand as I am a patient of his and I can only say I have never felt better. Forget about the skepticism you read or may believe, his techniques simply work 
 When I first got my German Shephard Pup, she was 14 weeks old. She was skinny, malnourished, very timid of people and particually other dogs. She would shake uncontrolably outside our home, and she would submisively wee for every person she met on the street. This book helped me understand what my dog was feeling, and of course most importantly it helped me deal with her behavior. Highly recommended 
 Alec Guiness plays a brilliant and idealistic, albeit rogue, chemist, who dreams of, and strives to, create the ultimate fabric, that will be indestructible and unsoilable.  He keeps getting jobs in research departments at textile mills, and conducts his experiments in little niches or side-rooms, always moving toward perfecting that perfect fabric.  Havoc ensues when he succeeds, as everyone panics over what this synthetic fabric will do to the textile industry.  Guiness never considered that aspect, and struggles to grasp the implications and ramifications, as weighed against attaining his dream.  I will give away no more of the plot.  Guiness is excellent, and everyone plays their parts very well.  The question raised by this film is an intriguing one.  What would happen to commerce if the perfect fabric were to be invented?  Or a car that doesn't wear out?  If healthcare could cure everything?  Is there a lot of planned obsolscence in our world, to protect jobs and incomes and free enterprise and capitalism?  Hmmmm.  A very enjoyable film, with a thought-provoking aspect 
 I think this book's art is quite nice and that the  text is gratifyingly  bold, which I like 
 This is Christian Music at it's most awesome level.  It is amazing that 5 of the most talented young men have blended their gifts,  diversity of backgrounds and skills together for a common goal of reaching the young at heart with a powerful message through music.  This CD is a MUST BUY!!  I can't hardly wait for the next project.  If you have the chance to catch one of their shows.....Run / don't walk; you'll be glad you did 
 I felt compelled to review this product after seeing some negative reviews of Mr. Rohn's CD.  This is the first time I've reviewed a product of any kind.  This program has changed my life.  I have listened to and read scores of CD's and books over the past 15 years and this is the only one I felt like I truly needed.  The principles contained therein are so fundamental that I feel like anything I investigate now is simply an addendum to what Mr. Rohn has taught me.  Once I went to work on what I could change (i.e. me) my life has taken on new meaning.  As Jim says, "learn to work harder on yourself than you do on your job."  Along with these two CD's, which are always loaded in my car's CD changer, I like to regularly refer to the book "Secrets of the Millionaire Mind," which I keep in my nightstand.  My 6 year old daughter ASKS me to play Jim when she rides in the car!  I'm not sure what to think of that 
 I loved this book because you could tear out the games and puzzles.Two thumbs up!!! -kriste 
 What a moving account of someone on "the inside" of the world of veterinary medicine. If anyone cannot be touched at the love and compassion of these "angels of mercy" working in the field of animals who are not only ill, but know will never recover, I would hate to believe it. But they have the best kind of love of all - they know the one they love is not going to be around "forever". They are willing to take the chance of being hurt by losing someone they love. And, if we will admit it, that is true of all love. They go into this with their eyes wide open, as should we, knowing that the time we have with those we love is temporary, and we must cherish and make the most of that time. 
 One of the best books I ever read! Fun tricks too! Penn and teller did it  again 
 Eddie Cochran is dead from a gun shot wound to the head. Whether his death was a suicide or a homicide has yet to be determined by the San Francisco Police Department. To them Eddie is just another dead body and they have no shortage of those to investigate. So Moses McGuire, a local bar owner and Eddie's brother-in-law, enlists the help of his good friend Dismas Hardy to find out what really happened to Eddie. Hardy is an ex-cop and ex-lawyer who walked away from his career years ago after a personal tragedy and now bartends for Moses part-time. If it was a suicide, as seems apparent, why was the gun found in Eddie's left hand when he is right-handed? Also, there appears to be a suicide note but it is vague and unfinished. No one wants to believe that this bright young man with a prosperous future, a beautiful wife and a new baby on the way would simply end his own life for no apparent reason. Was it in fact a suicide? Or was Eddie caught in the middle of some sort of drug deal gone bad? Or is there another unthinkable factor involved in his death?   This is an outstanding whodunit!! It is also a very well-written story about a close-knit family dealing with the death of a beloved son, brother and husband. The ending was superb and I was totally shocked when I learned who the killer was as it is the very last person I would have suspected!  I recently finished reading Mr. Lescroart's latest novel, "The Second Chair", and was so impressed with Dismas Hardy that I decided to go back and read the series from the beginning. Hardy is a very engaging character. He has no aversion to throwing back more than a few drinks, loves a good dart game ( even carries his own set of darts around with him in his coat pocket) and has both a sense of humor and a great nose for detective work. If you have not read this first installment I advise you to pick up a copy. I'm so glad I did 
 This is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of American foreign policy. A year after this book was published, there were over a hundred reviews. Regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author, finds the author right or wrong, interesting or boring, this book is one of the most influential books, if not the most influential book that affected American foreign policy. In fact, the current Bush Adminstration's policies, George Kenan's containment, Henry Kissinger's policies as well as countless adminstration's policies are shaped or affected by this book. My area of study is the foreign policy of Post World War Two American governments, and never have I understood it with greater clarity after I read this book. It is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations, differing on extent. (I studied the policies first and read the book the year after). It is a fascinating book and hard to put down. The author writes in a European style (beautiful long sentences,etc.), which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co-students makes it more difficut to read. He tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically. Ms. Rice and Mr. Kissinger were heavily influenced by this book. To understand them, this is a must read. In and of itself, it is an excellent book, a classic, and thousands others significantly more qualified than I have reviewed it. Look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists 
 This paperback edition ISBN: 0894682199 (also as clothbound under ISBN: 0300065582) by Johannes Vermeer (Contributors: Ben Broos and Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr. with Albert Blankert and Jorgen Wadum; Editor: Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr.) is a lavishly illustrated catalog with excellent reproductions for the first exhibition devoted solely to the works of Johannes Vermeer--the 17th-century Dutch painter who explored the psychological nuances of human endeavor--opening at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., in November 1995 (Royal Cabinet of Paintings Mauritshuis, the Hague, in March 1996). 232 pp., 127 illustrations including 60 color plates, 12.0 x 9.5 x 0.75 inches. ISBN: 061350710X is an entirely different book for children not even close to this one 
 I've gotten recommendations for David Levithan's books before, but I'd never read any.  I picked this up at the bookstore and was hooked.  Although I enjoyed basically every part of this book, my favorite was Charlotte's narrative.  I cannot express how much I loved it, how much I wanted to be like her and do that.  "The Realm of Possibility" is definitely worth reading; it won't take you long.  It is amazing 
 The addition of this title and its companion volume, "Later Novels & Other Writings," to the venerable Library of America series makes official what mystery fans have always known: Raymond Chandler is one of the gods of American literature. Following the trail blazed by Dashiell Hammett, Chandler created Philip Marlowe and the set the standard against which all private detective fiction is measured. This two-volume set covers almost the full canon of Chandler's work from early pulp stories to all the Marlowe novels, the screenplay for "Double Indemnity," and essays on the mystery genre plus the usual Library of America goodies such as notes on the text and a chronology of the author's life. In terms of literary inventions, the Wild West cowboy and the hard-boiled PI are this country's only true native sons, and, as such, are deserving of resepct. One of them at least now has it.--Michael Roge 
 I work in the video game industry and am working on a game that has a railroad level in it. These model railroad books are the perfect reference! The whole book is filled with great ideas and each idea is supported with real photographs. A+ One of the best  "reference" books I've ever purchased 
 Incredible weaving of four stories that all tie together. Gaghan brilliantly executed the telling of a deep story with masterey. The cinematography, score, storyline, and characters are well-thought out and well chosen. It's a deep pool that requires close attention. I've seen it four times and just now feel as if I'm truly beginning to understand all of it. Can't wait for the next Gaghan film 
 Fire from top to bottom, if u really from these streets dawg you'll feel this.  Cause when u out there and pop a cd like this in the deck its nothin but motivation.  From push it to prayer Ross is spitting it flawda is here dawg respect it 
 In this book, a boy named Palmer is living in a town that has a festival every year that involves shooting pigeons. In this part of the festival, every ten year old boy in the town becomes a wringer. Wringers wring the necks of the wounded pigeons to ensure their deaths. Every boy in the town can't wait until their tenth birthday. Every boy except for Palmer. Palmer lives his life dreading the day that he turns ten. With his new "friends" Beans, Mutto, and Henry, he gets pressured to become a wringer to stay "cool". He has another secret, though. Palmer has a pigeon, Nipper. When he becomes friends with the girl that he and the gang have been torturing, Dorothy Gruzik, a.k.a Fishface, will she give him the courage to stand up for what he believes is right?  
 With rumors of a 4th edition looming in the eaves to swoop down upon consumers at some time in the not-to-distant future, I am hoping that they adopt many of the aspects of this system.  I really like reputation, wealth, and talent trees.    Reputation is your reknown among people who walk in similar professions as you. If you are a criminal, the cops and fellow crooks would use this to see if they heard of you or know you on sight.  Wealth is a general sense of your financial worth, ranging from 0 to 31+.  Instead of carrying money, you roll a D20, add your wealth, and if it is higher than the "value" of the item, then you are able to purchase it.  If it is an expensive item (i.e. a car or a house), then the GM can have you deduct a point of two from your wealth score in order to represent the money tied up in that purchase.  Talent Trees: Each of the classes have a series of talents that they are good at.  Think of them as specialized feats that only that class can have.  Depending on one's character focus, this can have an impact on how you multiclass in the future.  These three features really set the game apart from D&D. Combined with the generic classes and character occupations, and you have characters that feel more free form and unique than the classes in D&D.    My only real complaint is that the "Advanced Classes", the D20 Modern equivalent of Prestige Classes, are lackluster and rather pointless.  They take away from the strengths of the basic system 
 Glad I bought this CD. It was my first exposure to Ali Farka Toure, but my experience with Ry  gave me the confidence to explore new ground. Good move 
 I have been a big Star Wars fan since the first film was released back in 1977. I used to own many of the old action figures and played with them all the time up until my grandmother gave them away to the Goodwill. I picked up this book in 1997 just as I was getting back into collecting Star Wars figures once again. This is a very detailed book with lots of great color photos. Seeing the pictures of all of the older toys brought back a lot of memories. And it makes you stop and think about how much your old collection would have been worth if you had saved it. I recommend this book to anyone who is a true Star Wars fan and collector. You will not be disappointed 
 If you want a modern english version that's funny and easy to read, this is the book for you. If you are looking for something scholarly and/or more difficult to read, get a different version. 
 This book has been the introduction and standard critical biography since it first appeared in 1974 and then in 1994, updated and expanded by Jeanne Reesman. I don't know what another reviewer means by "high tower" academics; these authors have spent their careers studying Jack London from his earliest work to his last. They offer balanced and insightful analysis of the man and his enormously popular and artistically compelling works. I read it cover to cover 
 My husband and I received this changing table, along with the 4-drawer chest and the Monterey crib, as a gift from our parents. We were skeptical, because we wanted a nursery that was affordable, yet not too flimsy.  We were pleasantly surprised once the pieces were put together. The pieces coordinate beautifully with the nursery, and will take our soon-to-be-born infant into childhood. And the nicest part is that you don't have to spend thousands of dollars to have a nice nursery. My friends and family are constantly complimenting us on how great the pieces look and how sturdy they are. * The only reason I rated this 4-stars instead of 5 was because two of the drawers rubbed together slightly once assembled. It was very easily fixed by adjusting the drawer tracks, took 5 minutes. BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a beautiful, quality nursery that is affordable, this is a great choice 
 This fictionalized account of the painting of the Sistine Chapel ceiling focuses on the battle of wills between the artist, Michelangelo (Charlton Heston), and his patron, Pope Julius II (Rex Harrison).  As the story opens, Michelangelo, already an established sculptor, is commissioned by the warrior Pope to decorate his ceiling.  Michelangelo doesn't want to do it, preferring to concentrate on the 40 statues intended for Julius' tomb.  But the Pope wins that battle, the first of many, for the two men are equally matched in their stubbornness and pride.  The work is detailed against the backdrop of Julius' many military battles and we learn a lot about life during the Renaissance.  There is a relationship with Michelangelo's childhood friend, the Countess of Medici, that  shows his single-minded devotion to his craft.    Both Michelangelo and Julius are portrayed as stiff-necked, driven men who use reverse-psychology on each other to get what they want.  The dialogue is literate and yet each line is delivered like a grand speech.  We learn a great deal about Julius as a man and not as much about Michelangelo.  These are bravura performances by Heston and Harrison; they play men with monumental egos and ambitions but infuse them with human faults and foibles.  A wonderful documentary over-view of Michelangelo's work that precedes the film would have been better at the end.  I enjoyed the film almost as much as Irving Stone's novel, and that's saying a lot.  Kon 
 This film is a red hot thriller as the New York Times said in February 1988 when it was theatrically released. Warren Stantin(Sidney Poitier) is an FBI agent in pursuit of a kidnapping and murder suspect. He appoints Jonathan Knox(Tom Berenger) as his guide. Jonathan would have been arrested for obstruction of justice if he didn't follow Warren's order. "You're under arrest." said Warren,after Jonathan initially refused to go along with him. Jonathan replied,"Bulls--t!". Rounding out the cast is pre-Cheers Kirstie Alley as the leader of a group on a mountain mission. Another member(Clancy Brown) is the aforementioned suspect who ends up kidnapping Alley and threatening to fatally shoot her. "You kill her and you'll die half a second later!",Warren tells the suspect. Warren also says,"Let her go or die! That's the only deal you're gonna make!" The suspect is shot by Warren and falls into the open seas. Poitier's previous film credits include STIR CRAZY,which he directed only,GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER,UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT and LET'S DO IT AGAIN. Berenger subsequently starred in MAJOR LEAGUE and MAJOR LEAGUE 2. Alley subsequently starred in MADHOUSE,LOOK WHO'S TALKING,LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO and LOOK WHO'S TALKING NOW 
 What a joy to find another well written and timely novel from one of the very best writers of the last half of the twentieth century.  His command of language is second to none and his ability to keep you turning pages well into the night is right up there with the best 
 THINKING VISUALLY contains many exercises, strategies for solving problems, and a good index.  I bought it because I am an artist, but it might appeal and be useful to anyone who thinks for a living or wants to become more creative.  It contains relaxation exercises and ways to use your dreams.   You can use the book to enhance your imagination, think more abstractly, structure your thinking, etc.  Some of the exercises are actually small tests. In summary, the book is serious fun and very stimulating 
 Being profoundly interested in the human experience I was drawn to the writing of Diane Ackerman and A Natural History of Senses. I went into the read with an open, willing mind, prepared to further understand our five senses. Certainly I was not disappointed, as Ackerman delivered a treasure; poetically diving head first into the sense of smell, touch, taste, hearing, and vision. Ackerman leaves the reader with room to wonder as she lightly dotes on each of the senses without overfilling the reader. She tells the story from the point of view of an active observer and an experience-filled individual.  The reader wants to believe and soak in what she writes.   She provides surprising facts, "we can detect over ten thousand odors" for the reader to ponder. In other moments she will mix fact with grand narrative, "music, the perfume of hearing, probably began as a religious act to arouse groups of people." She then might turn and reinforce facts with a personal tidbit, "scuba diving in the Bahamas some years ago, I became aware of two things..." which makes the facts come to life for the reader. Ackerman is brilliant in her mix of personal experiences, rich narrative and interesting trivia. She even throws in a recipe in the footnotes!  One section in the chapter of touch, Adventures in the Touch Dome, is so well done it is as if Ackerman took a video camera through the Exploratorium she was describing and gave the footage verbatim back to the reader. I could almost feel what she was describing. In Ackerman's own words, "the pliant walls give birth to you...or guide you to a sea of what feels like navy beans, or leave you grasping your way forward among rope hammocks." But to be honest the chapter of the mute sense of smell drew me in the furthest. Ackerman appeared the most passionate here; almost seeming to need to defend smell as an under-appreciated sense.   Throughout reading this book, I caught myself thinking of a Cirque de Sol performance. They are masters at engaging the senses. As Ackerman teaches they are not the only ones, "real estate dealers sometimes spray "cake-baking" aromas around the kitchen of a house before showing it to a client." She describes the job of perfumers in how they attract different types of clientele. Certainly it is smart business to positively engage the buyer's senses.   Overall this is a five star book from my viewpoint. Informative, pleasurable, poetic, entertaining are all apt descriptors. I think the major strength of this book was the intention put forth. My imagination tells me Ackerman could have written a book of this size on any one of the senses so if there is a critique it is that some of the sections stop short of fulfilling all the readers needs to understand a particular sense. Ackerman does not try to tell the reader all about the sense of smell or any of the other sense rather she dips a stick in sugar and lets you have a little sample of each, well done.   
 Prince's 1981 album CONTROVERSY is another classic album in his catalog. The title track is the standout immediately. This longer version than the single version features a prayer. The song is funky and effective. "Sexuality" is a great disco/funk number. "Do Me, Baby" is probably one of the sexiest songs he's ever done. This full length version is the one to hear. "Private Joy" is another funky song which is another favorite on the album. "Ronnie, Talk To Russia" is a short protest kind of song. Same goes for "Annie Christian", which he wrote about the shooting of John Lennon, Ronald Reagan, various Atlanta child murders. Not as effective as "Ronnie, Talk To Russia" but a decent track nonetheless. Overall a highlight in Prince's career 
   I love these Jazz For...cd's All of the Savoy Jazz/Jazz 32, including this one, cd's are great. The music really goes with the mood that the title suggests. These are of great value to other (instrumental)jazz lovers 
 Obsessed is a psychological thriller with lots of action and plot twists.   It will keep the reader entertained from beginning to end.  In spite of that, I don't think it is as good as several of Ted Dekker's other books.  It is pretty dark and has some pretty sadistic behavior portrayed in it.  Although that can and does make for entertaining reading, it may be a bit more than is necessary for this type of book.  This story is based upon one of the parables of Jesus.  If you are looking for a fast paced adventure, this would be a good one to read.  If you haven't read anything by Ted Dekker before, I would recommend starting with one of the other ones first such as Three, Blink, or the Circle Trilogy (Black, Red, White).  
 The cast iron pan came in record speed and it was fabulous ~ a great gift 
 This is Iron Maiden's first single from the latest album "A Matter of Life and Death." The single includes 3 tracks "Different World" and two older songs "Hallowed Be Thy Name" and "The Trooper" both of which were recorded during the Radio 1 Legends Session. Great songs, great artwork, what more can one say?? 
 Since its first edition in 1972, and especially with the completely revised and greatly expanded 2nd edition in 1990, this comprehensive work has become the standard guide and textbook in the pursuit of U.S. genealogical research. Beginning with the background to research -- what "research" actually means, specialized terminology, basic principles, library fundamentals, and all the rest -- Greenwood teaches you, with great clarity and many examples, how to identify what information you need, how to go about locating it, and how to organize it once you've found it. The second, much larger part of the book, leads the reader through the use, analysis, and interpretation of all the major sorts of documents and records out there: Compiled sources (including a discussion of the nature of compilations), vital records, census returns, wills and probate records (and how to become comfortable with legal terminology), local and federal land records, civil and criminal court records, church records, records relating to immigration, military records, and cemetery and burial records. He discusses the nature of abstracting, clears up common misconceptions about court records, points out the limitations of the census, and presents a largely rewritten discussion of the standards of evidence. When the 2nd edition came out a decade ago, the author thought his book would probably never need another major revision, just minor updates. But that was before the personal computer and Internet revolutions forced him to rethink his position, and this edition includes an entirely new and rather lengthy chapter on the appropriate use of the computer in genealogical research and also on its built-in limitations. He also took the opportunity to add a chapter on the legal issues relating to women's property rights, and (of course) made all those minor corrections and updates he had expected. Bluntly, if you can afford only one how-to book for your home genealogy shelf, get this one 
 DARING TO DREAM is the first book in the Dream trilogy. An interesting tale about Margo Sullivan who had visions of grandeur but wouldn't let her dreams die. She grew up in Monterey, California in a mansion. She was treated like a family member, but was actually the daughter of the housekeeper. Her mother tried to keep Margo's feet on the ground, but it didn't work. She went on to have a successful modeling career until scandal ruined it and caused her to go bankrupt, but she continued to dream. She retreats to her hometown and back into the friendship with Kate and Laura, her two childhood friends who grew up in the same house with her.   Sound like a normal romance - it is up until the first few pages, then it has jumps and turns that are very unexpected. Margo ends up talking her buddies into a business venture that saves each of them from the ghosts that hound them.   One thing that is interesting is that the running of the business is not glamorized and is shown as very hard work, but still enjoyable. This runs more along the real lines of actual life than fantasy, but has a dose of "real life" now and then for good measure.  DARING TO DREAM is a very enjoyable book. The only trilogy that I liked better than this one was the Born In series! 
 I thought the movie was great it was a heart warming story  . john travolta and scarlett johansson did an excellent job. 
 IF YOU THOUGHT MACK 10 WAS THE MAN FROM INGLEWOOD .THEN YOU MUST HAVE SLEPT ON THE ROAD DAWGS.THESE ARE SOME BONIFIDE TALENTED  WEST COAST RAPPERS.AND  THEY PUTTING IT DOWN BETTER THAN SOME THE WEST COAST RAPPERS.CHECK OUT SONGS LIKE (CLIENTEL,MURDERFEST,MY LIFE, BOUNCIN,AND BREAK YA'SEIF,FRT.COFFEE BROWN)GANGSTA HITS GOTTA LOVE THAT!THEY ARE FADING ALBUMS NOW.SWAMP AND G-LUV HAVE A FLOW SMOOTHER THAN WATER AND VOICES UNFORGETABLE.

 While searching for a movie I was sure no one else in my family would want to see, I stumbled into the forgeign film section of Blockbuster. I was intregued by the title of this film and gave it a shot. This turned out to be one of the best movies I've ever seen! Unfortunatly, my family ended up watching it with me, but they loved it too. Though they are generally umm.. American in their ways and don't appriciate films from or about other cultures, they too loved this movie. 
 Andy Goldsworthy is a wizard , a magic man with the vision and skill to bring it out for all to see. Unlike still photos ,  this DVD can come much closer to capturing  the " life" of his work. From inception to creation to final destruction , it's all there .  Watch and be amazed and inspired. 
 There is a huge oversight in the manufacturing of these discs.  The discs are double sided and they failed to identify which side is Side A and which side is Side B.  When they come new, Side A is facing up.  But if you don't put them back in the same way, you'll need to actually put the disc into the player and pull up the episode index before you'll know whether you have the correct side or need to remove the disc and turn it over.  I have looked very carefully and there is NO indication of Side A or B on any of my discs.  Perhaps they corrected the problem part way through manufacturing, but I can assure you there is nothing on my discs to tell.  Anyway, that is my only beef.  The ER series is top notch and I think most of us are familiar with it or we wouldn't be considering buying this.  I give it four stars only because of the manufacturing issue 
 If you are interested in Guy Williams and his life, this is the definitive book. Very detailed, extremely well researched, the author presents her subject objectively and fairly. I expected something glossy, a fan treatment, but discovered a really well written and researched biography. Highly recommend 
 Es una muy buena referencia. Las fotos correspondientes a los katas expuestos son fáciles de seguir para quienes tengan una idea previa del mismo 
 Authenic but a little bland for me. I add Ponzu sauce to taste and make sure it gets really HOT in the micriwave. If steaming when you take it out, it tastes better. Pre Rinsing the noodles (as directed) is nonsense. Just cover them with good clean water (I never use TAP) stir in the sauce and toppings and nuke it about 90 seconds, uncovered. Stir and serve. It had everyone in MY OFFICE drooling with questions! Best price is on Amazon, just order 2 so you don't pay shipping. 
 There is a reason that Neil Simon is revered by the public, yet basted by critics. His plays contain characters and situations that just about anyone can relate with. BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS is based upon Simon's youth. It is a family play; not only is it about a family, it is a play that the whole family will enjoy. Lots of laughs and tons of fun 
 In March 2006, there are only three or four books that boast Haskell in their titles.  They are all excellent books.  But the world can benefit from more Haskell books.  In fact, we are in need of such books, especially CS1 texts.  This book is a pleasure to read.  I suspect that even math haters will not find it hostile.  Anyone learning Haskell will find the book and its companion web site a valuable resouce.  On the web site, you will find the source code from the book, such as Powerseries.hs.  You can quickly play and experiment with it; read and learn from it.   I wish more books are as pleasant and affordable ($25) 
 First let me say, Jim Harrison is the best "literary" writer working today. I formed that opinion based on some of his earlier work(Farmer, A Good Day To Die), and so had high expectations for True North. I wasn't disappointed.  The novel follows the quest of the protagonist, David Burkett, as he tries to come to terms with the evil done by his father to others, and to the land he loves. David finds more ambiguities than answers, though, and the clear sense of right and wrong that drives him begins to erode.  David's complex relationships with his family and to the natural world, as shaded by the past, are expertly explored. This is Harrison in top form 
 This was my very first electronic cd. I picked it up at the local record store on impulse, and didn't expect much. At first listen, it seemed somewhat pretentious, indulgent, artsy... This was my idea of trance music in general at the time. In fact, I bought this album as a challenge to myself: I wanted to give every style of music a fair chance.  After my 30 second scan of each track, I left it alone until one fateful night. My friend Ricky pulled out some nifty little toys called glowsticks! He told me he had been learning how to make interesting light shows out of them, but the only "techno" music he had was a horrible mix tape featuring the likes of alice deejay, t-99, and other outdated rave-monkey acts. I shuddered at every track's rediculous synths and over-enhanced basslines. So he noticed my copy of "Another World" sitting in my cd tower, and suggested we try it.   I was overwhelmed at the difference it made to play this album on Ricky's 6,000-dollar home stereo. I was simply blown away at the darkly hypnotic, and playfully dreamy sounds that were coming out of the speakers. I picked up the glowsticks for my first time and I created something beautiful out of this mix.  And now, 6 years later, I still keep coming back to this mix whenever I need to unwind. Seriously, almost EVERY SINGLE TRACK here is on my list of favorites. However, the two that really stand out to me the most are North Sky and Tears in the Rain. I still whistle the melody of the Vangelis song to my baby nephew as a lullaby, and he loves it.  Summing it all up: These are some of the most intense, uplifting, and soulful pieces of music I have ever experienced. If you have a patient ear, and an active mind... You will enjoy this mix 
 After watching all of the incredible performers a few weeks ago on this year's Grammy broadcast, I thought spotlighting many of the nominated and winning artists would be fitting. But how do you spotlight 21 artists and performances into one review? Easy. Once you pick up this CD and take a listen, you'll realize and revel with some of your favorite artists, such as Mariah Carey and her nominated R&B slammer, "It's Like That," Coldplay's "Speed Of Sound," Rob Thomas' "Lonely No More" and Gorillaz "Feel Good Inc." And those are just four of the nominated artists and songs. What about the other big winners? They're all here, including Green Day and their brilliant Record Of The Year "Boulevard Of Broken Dreams," Stevie Wonder's sensational ballad "From The Bottom Of My Heart," two-time winning sensation Kelly Clarkson with her electrifying pop rocker "Since U Been Gone," and the big winners of the evening, U2, chiming in with "City Of Blinding Lights," and John Legend's superb song, "Ordinary People." If that's not enough, Paul McCartney made his first-ever Grammy performance come alive this year, so it's only appropriate to spotlight his stunning selection "Fine Line." Other vets include The Rolling Stones' "Rain Fall Down," Neil Young's "The Painter," Springsteen's winner "Devils & Dust," Seal's phenomenal "Walk On By" and Sheryl Crow's splendid "Good Is Good." Rounding out the disc is Rascal Flatts, Hawaii's own Jack Johnson, rock and roll's Foo Fighters, Beck, Death Cab For Cutie and alternative music's Franz Ferdinand. If it's a potpourri of music you desire, you can't miss with this CD 
 Merryn Anstee and Scott Crozier's 2004 production of 'Cloudstreet' is being presented by the acclaimed St. Michael's Grammar School (St. Kilda, Melbourne, Australia) as part of their 2004 Senior Drama Festival. The school, whose alumnus contributes to many facets of Australia's theatre industry, will present six performances at The Studio on campus, opening 23 July 2004. Merryn Anstee is hailed as one of Australia's finest drama teachers and foremost theatre directors. St. Michael's is noted as Australia's most prestigious academic and dramatic arts training institutions.  The school has had recent successful seasons of Peter Shaffer's 'Amadeus', Stephen Sondheim's 'Sweeney Todd', Carol Churchill's 'Top Girls' and Shakespeare's 'King Lear'. Season sold out. 
 Has anyone but me noticed that the reviewer, Reed Business Information, has never met a book about Republicans/conservatives that they like?   Anyway, "My Father, My President" is written by the daughter of a famous man, who happened to serve 8 years as Vice President and 4 years as President, among other public service positions. President Bush 41 has made it very plain that he will not write his memoirs, as most Presidents have rushed to do when they're out of office. Dorothy, or Doro, his daughter, has put together her recollections along with those of hundreds of President Bush's family, friends, political friends/foes, etc. She has not delved deeply into politics and I don't think that was her intention.   I've read a lot about many presidents and thought this might be like the others, but My Father, My President is a very interesting read, and her observations and insights into her father do not vary much from what others have written of President Bush 41.  If you enjoy a good read, put your personal politics aside and spend time with My Father, My President. 
 This was a good book, and it is easy enough for younger children to understand when you read it to them. For on-their-own-reading, it would be in my opinion, for ages 8-9. Personally, my favorite story was the family contest, in which each child had to perform an act of bravery, I think bravery, anyway, it showed the readers, or listeners, good acts to do, and it showed with a good act, comes a wonderful reward 
 This is a particular spy novel. If you are looking for action you will be satisfied. Neverless I remeber Berlin in 1983 and later from two sides of the famous wall. Lot of those specific atmosphere of divided city can be  find in the trilogy. The book is really worth reading for that reason 
 This book was one of my all time favorites...I  could not remember the name of it only that moms arent always right...and the imagery has stayed with me for some 20 years 
 Having read the Bagavad Gita, it only much later dawned on me that Carlos is Arjuna and Don Juan is Krishna - only the wisdom is completely different. But in the Gita we have Arjuna who has an ordinary mind and not much bravery at all who yet faces the fact that he has to make a rite of passage which seemingly involves summoning courage to fight an all-inclussive family feud, but becomes something far more spiritualmysticalmetaphysical as he keeps balking at Krisna's encouragement to go through with the pasage. Arjuna keeps telling Krishna he doesn't understand a word Krishna said and Krishna patiently launches into another in-depth explanation - and it is evident that in order for Krishna to fully express the wisdom, spirituality and higher truth of the cosmos, it is necessary for Arjuna to NOT get him and to be continually the baffled coward, hopeless to ever attain gravitational escape velocity, and always planted at square one while Krishna patiently and lovingly imparts the esoteric wonders - like one of those books - "Karma for the Complete Idiot".Castaneda seems to have applied the same schematic - whether knowingly or not - to spoonfeed the Don Juanisms to the reader. And they ARE truly profound - they're too heavy to be something Castaneda just sat at his writing table whipping up out of whole cloth!Castaneda did his research and it's the power of the Don Juan "nuggets" that make the books truly transcendent and generous in their magic - which is contagious to a reader! That said, however, I got the feeling that Castaneda was, by the 4th or 5th volume, really starting to spin his wheels and using more effort than content to take us to the next level. Castaneda has done a great service in giving humanity some cracks to fall through in our supposed finite  and material trappings. And so has the Bagavad Gita 
 This is an excellent book, well illustrated with images useful in meditation. The text is straight forward and immediately applicable. It is one of the best guides in practical methods of meditating. Good for the  experienced as well as the novice. In a way we are all novices! I would  give it at 10 Star Rating 
 Starting in 1960 with the success of the American International Pictures release "The Fall of the House of Usher", producer/director Roger Corman began a highly successful collaboration with legendary Hollywood actor Vincent Price adapting a number of Edgar Allan Poe short stories into very atmospheric horror films glowing with rich technicolour. They really reached their creative peak with their second teaming in the classic story "The Pit and the Pendulum", which is my favourite of all the efforts they worked on together. Roger Corman long known as a low budget "B", movies specialist here has outdone himself with an incredibly lavish looking production that while having little relation to the original Poe story manages to weave a fascinatingly eerie tale helped along by one of Vincent Prices' best performances in this genre. "The Pit and the Pendulum", apart from employing the macabre torture device of the title in its gripping conclusion also boasts magnificently eerie sets, great period detail and beautiful tones of colour that are sure to warm the heart of any classic horror movie lover.    The story opens, (unusually for a Poe story), in 16th Century Spain  where we see young Francis Barnard (John Kerr), travelling up to the sinister seaside castle of his brother-in-law Don Nicholas Medina (Vincent Price). Coming all the way from England however this is not just a social call as he is seeking answers to the sudden death of his sister Elizabeth (Barbara Steele), who was Nicholas' wife. Nicholas however is a most complex character himself and attempts to brush aside any discussion regarding Elizabeth's demise putting down simply to some problem with her blood. He is secretly tormented by the memory of his sadistic father Sebastian Medina (Also Vincent Price in flashbacks), who was a member of the Spanish Inquisition and set up his own private torture chamber in the basement of the Castle. Sebastian was also responsible for burying alive his unfaithful wife before his young son's eyes.  In his tormented state Nichiolas also fears that he may have been responsible for burying Elizabeth alive as well and very soon strange noises are heard in the Castle including the sound of someone playing a harpsichord that only Elizabeth could play. All these strange occurences seem to indicate that Nicholas was right in guessing that Elizabeth has come back from the dead to torment him for his crime. Nicholas is counselled by the supposedly sympathetic family doctor Charles Leon (Anthony Carbone), that Elizabeth could not be alive and that what he is hearing is in his mind while Francis who is still trying to uncover exactly what happened to his sister begins to suspect the doctor and gets the impression he is anxious for him to be on his way before anything is discovered. However matters take a turn for the worst when Nicholas' mind finally breaks when Elizabeth's previously locked room is ransacked and he takes on the persona of his demented father believing that he is still back in the time of the Inquisition. When Elizabeth actually seems to "rise from the dead", however she and her "accomplise", plans goes badly wrong and  dealing with a sadistic "Sebastian", rather than a mentally destroyed "Nicholas", as was planned both meet grisly ends in a deep pit in the cellar and imprisonment in a deadly iron maiden torture devise. Francis also runs into trouble with the reborn Sebastian who now views him as an enemy to be removed and Francis finds himself in the thrilling climax strapped to a table below a rapidly decending swinging pendulum that has a sharp cutting blade. It is only with the quick thinking of Nicholas' sister Catherine (Luana Anders), that he is rescued and the tortured Nicholas meets his own grisly end falling into the Castle's pit.  Rarely have any of the Corman /Vincent Price collaborations been as lavish as "The Pit and the Pendulum". From the wonderful visuals of Nicholas' sinister Castle literally howering on a mist shrouded cliff in the opening scenes to the tremendously atmospheric Castle interiors thickly laden with opulent furniture, mysterious sliding panels and a cobweb filled torture chamber with all manner of fiendish devices, this film is a special treat for the horror movie lover. Vincent Price of course is the centre of all attention here in his colourful roles of both the tormented Nicholas Medina and in the flashbacks, his evil father Sebastian and he brings his usual polished performing skills to the dual roles making "The Pit and the Pendulum", one of his most memorable films from the 1960's. John Kerr still best remembered for his performance on Broadway and in the film version of "Tea and Sympathy", surprisingly makes a fairly colourless young male lead here and really doesn't appear to do much with his character making it the one weakness in the acting ensemble present. Barbara Steele, mysteriously dubbed here for some reason, and Antony Carbone as the villians of the piece are wonderful in their roles and Carbone especially really excels as the "caring", doctor who is not all he first seems to be. Being a period film Roger Corman has gone all out in the visuals for "The Pit and the Pendulum", with rich colour and authentic 16th Century costumes really capturing the flavour of the time. The creepy atmosphere is further enhanced by the thunder storms and lightening that are of course almost an essential element in most horror tales but which here become almost a character in themselves as the raging storms seem to build in momentum and ferosity as Nicholas' state of mind slowly crumbles.   Vincent Price really had a complete rebirth as an in demand actor for horror films as a result of his hugely popular efforts in these Roger Corman horror films for American International. He always brings an integrity and style to his characters no matter how over the top the proceedings taking place in the stories are. The sight of a deranged Vincent Price gleefully hovering over John Kerr tied down beneath the swinging pendulum is probably one of the most famous horror images from the 1960's and this startling climax to the story helps make "The Pit and the Pendulum", an essential part of any horror lovers film library. Highly recommended.

 I loved the title story in this collection. Everything in it worked toward the perfect culmination. Some of the other stories fell a bit flat, and the ones that leaned toward the "experimental," only a couple, were not my cup of tea. Overall a very satisfying read 
 To truly appreciate Godspeed You! Black Emperor and the band's compositions is to undertake a different mode of musical consumption. The band, and its records are not easily devoured, picked-up, and left off. To truly, and completely appreciate what the band does, one is required to, at least, see the song from beginning to end, and at best, follow the album through its entirety. GSY!BE, its albums and its songs are best taken in it entirety, as opposed to the sum of its parts (though many do, stand solidly on its own).   Extended periods of droning ambiance, white/grey noise and subtle strumming serve to contrast for louder and more dominant movements (and make no mistake, the songs are written movement). Parts that may be conceived of are boring are most likely misunderstood.   If a listener really wishes to appreciate the piece as a whole, think of quiet moments as the serene breath before a driving exhalation.  Oh, and to be accurate, this album was release in Oct. 2000, whereas UxO was released in Nov. of 2004 
 Right from the moment it arrive my daughter loves it. She sleeps perfectly and has a dora stuffed to sleep with her at nightnight time 
 Another great Drew Barrymore movie. Another great cross-country road trip movie. Whoppi Goldberg stars as a lesbian lounge singer in search of a new life; Drew Barrymore stars as a pregnant girl who accidentally killed her abusive boyfriend; and Mary Louise Parker stars as an uptight real estate agent who is infected with HIV. The three women hide out in a small town in Arizona, hoping to start a new life. The relationship between Goldberg's character and Parker's character is very touching. A great chick flick 
 If you have ever wondered what a real man, a real woman, or a real something in-between is, this is a must read.  "My Gender Workbook" has interactive exercises, advice, and guidance on gender, and provokes the reader to question the whole idea of gender as an absolute.  We all have elements of each gender, and Bornstein goes to the point of arguing that there are many genders, not just two, and it is possible to lack gender entirely.  As a transgendered person myself, I found the book enlightening and helpful in my own discovery of gender, and who I really am.  In fact, this is one of the most useful books I have found on gender identity, and I refer back to it often 
 Can we that were not there ever feel the force of the War on two fronts. Attacked by the Japs and fighting the Germans across the world. Losing constantly through 1942 in the Pacific but starting to correct as this books shows. It was a time of standing up and doing what was right. Of all the great men we lost we will forever honor and also appreciate all that came home and worked hard to make our country what it is today. It is a great book and I could read it again. UHH RAH 
 My 4 year old really enjoys this whole series of Cat in the Hat books. He loves "reading" about insects, flowers, space, etc. The format of this series of books is very similar (if not exact)and are easy to follow and keeps a busy boy captivated. The rhyming, illustrations (& antics) keep my son interested and learning in the process 
 I thought Shlain's 3rd book, Sex, Time, and Power, was one of the most brilliant, well written books I've ever read.  The Alphabet Versus the Goddess has managed to impress me even more.  Shlain's astounding theories are revolutionary, and he backs them up with excellent scholarship and sound arguments.  This book should replace Western History textbooks, and is a must for any writer or artist, regardless of whether s/he is interested in gender studies.  It not only elucidates why we must become more whole brained thinkers/feelers, it paves new directions in the fields of psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience.  It is undeniably history and herstory, woven together in an exquisite work of art 
 USE THE XL MOST EVERY DAY AND FIND THAT IT DOES A FAIRLY GOOD JOB FOR WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. ONLY USE IT ABOUT TEN MINENTS AT A TIME SINCE I AM 72 I DONT OVERDUE IT. CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN MY ABDOMEN ALREADY 
 I love this book! It has so much more to offer than the book I bought at Crate and Barrel for 5x the price. It's quirky and fun and filled with unusual recipes. Great selection of drinks for summer days, cold nights, casual get togethers or swanky cocktail parties. Plus it's filled with tons of hilarious footnotes that are worth quoting while you mix. My favorite drinks (not just because the names are great): the Red Carpet, the Presidential, Silk Stockings, and the Slow Comfortable Screw. You have to try the mojito. This really is the prettiest cocktail book I've seen.  Perfect gift item--just tie a bow around it and add a bottle of your friend's favorite alcohol. 
 Yakov Bok is a humble Jewish fixer (carpenter) living in Russia in 1910. He leaves his small village and moves to Kiev, looking for work and a better life. His wife has left him for another man and he has no significant relations to speak of. It's a dangerous time to be Jewish, as the pogroms are widespread and practically government sanctioned. Pretending to be a gentile, Bok finds work with an anti-semite at a brickyard and moves into an area that is off limits for Jews. Things go well for a while, until a young Christian boy is killed and Bok finds himself framed for the murder.   Although there is no evidence against him, other than hysterical, unreliable anti-semite "witnesses", things look bad for Bok and he is thrown in prison to await a formal indictment.   The majority of the book covers Bok's time in prison and solitary confinement. It becomes clear the prosecution is dragging its feet, not delivering the indictiment, as they have a shaky chance of winning the case if it ever goes to trial.   It's a fast book, but a very painful and somewhat depressing one. It deals heavily with anti-Semitism. Some of the anti-semitic passages are almost breathtaking in their ferocity. It becomes very painful, at times almost (but not quite) tragi-comic. In particular, a lengthy sermon (?) given by a priest that basically likens the Jewish to vampires.   In many ways the book reminded me of "1984". A man up against the monolithic powers of the state. Not quite as imposing though, because Bok seems to grow stronger and more resiliant in his spirit even as his body and mind are broken. The prosecution repeatedly dangles a confession in his face but Bok refuses steadfastly to sign, even at the risk of triggering a pogrom. It's interesting to note that Bok is also an avowed aetheist, and stolidly refuses to seek solace in God. He reads the bible only as a way of keeping himself from going insane, and the only thing that really seems to comfort him is philosophy (Spinoza, in particular) and the philosophical concept of freedom.   Part of what is so painful is that for long stretches the entire world seems to be against him. EVERYONE he encounters is either a thug, a snitch, a backstabber (or all three!).  An excellent book. A fast read, but very painful.   
 Ray Harryhausen's brillant animation technic is always exciting. To watch this little masterpiece is like you are 12 years old again in a room full of monster & hero toys and all of them getting alive.  Decent - even if matted it is anamorphic - picture quality and terrific surround sound are better than you remember it as in old theatre. Long live Ray 
 After all my searching and looking I found this book.It covers everyting from the materials used in painting to techniques used,be they murals or encaustics.I cant leave it down.It pushes me even to try new things and consequently new work.It is a book for alchemists and artists alike.I got the hardback and it stays close to me at all times even when I fly!I have my copy smudged all over with blues,greens,etc.You will also read about picture framing and reparation of work...how to tackle mildew..the list just goes on.Its not for painting by numbers thats for sure.I set out to write a short review!A real tome of a book.Get it for reference or for its "secret" knowledge.Opens worlds for artists.Good luc 
 These are exactly what they are advertised to be. I thoroughly enjoy using them 
 As a professor who teaches American History, I have to say how  impressed I am with WTC 9-11-01 Day of Disaster! It is a great learning tool that any teacher could use to show what the first responders were up against on 9/11/01. This historic event in American history is a lot like the "Great Fire of 1835" that occurred in New York City. Like the Fire of 1835, the fire was located in the same part of the city. Both events caused a huge major economic disaster. There was little or no water supply to fight both fires. History has a way of repeating itself. Hopefully we can learn from our mistakes, so that 9/11/01 will never happen again!   
 This is a great one! Very interesting and well presented, and it will definitely give you goosebumps toward the end!! 
 Following twenty for the most part superior collections of the "Year's Best Science Fiction', Gardner Dozois provides a look back cross section of those he felt were the best, albeit a relative term in this case.  This new compilation of stories previously published in the series does not contain one tale from each annual, but instead has multiples from the same year with only the 1987 and 1991 book omitted.  The tales represent some of the genre's top guns over the past two decades with each entry top rate.  This reviewer has been a long time fans of the series not just because the selections are always superb, but because they can be savored over a week or two; the same holds true for the all star selection.  Fans of the series will appreciate this look back with fond memories while newcomers will get a taste of what has been consistently one of best science fiction short story anthologies.

 I saw the theatrical cut (the 188 minute version) on video back in the 1980's.  I thought it was wonderful.  But when I saw the 312 minute version, I was astounded.  Many will say that the film is already 3 1/4 hours long, so what can another 2 hours do it?  In this case, an entirely differently and deeper experience.  Bertolucci's 1900 is very similar, in that the full length version actually seems shorter, because its flow is much smoother, storylines are clarified, and we see the great director's vision.  Here, you feel cheated in some way that the original never made it here.  Granted, Fanny was back in 1984, when there was no DVD.  Bergman had edited down other miniseries (like Face to Face and Scenes from a Marriage) to feature length, and the film versions were still very good.  But the full length version gives so much more depth and resonance to the work.  It's one of the greatest miniseries I've ever seen, rivaling Brideshead Revisited and I, Claudius.  Performance, cinemtography, and writing are all astounding.  This wasn't Bergman's final film (he did go on to direct After the Rehearsal shortly after this, and Saraband a couple of years back), but it is certainly one of his top five films, and that's really saying something...  
 I bought this book for a female friend of mine who's a flight attendant, she flys to Honolulu often, and wants to take up surfing.  I read a favorable review in Making Waves, a monthly publication by the Surfrider Foundation.  I would have to agree, especially the sections on surf etiquette, right-of-way rules, stoke, and spreading the Aloha spirit.  Items you probably learn in an hour lesson 
 This book is one of the more readable and accessible books by Sterling Seagrave which I have read (the others being Lords of the Rim and The Yamato Dynasty), and much more enjoyable and interesting to read as well.  Dragon Lady is a biography of the Last Empress of China, Tzu His.  In a highly readable fashion, Seagrave debunks the popular history of Tzu Hsi as a highly sexed, manipulative and ruthless woman.  Instead, Seagrave portrays the Dowager Empress as a mere tool, being manipulated by powerful Manchu Princes and other figures behind the throne of the China for their own ends.  The general and popular view of Tzu Hsi has its origins in reportings and books by JOP Bland and Sir Edmund Backhouse.  In particular, Backhouse, in the late 19th and early 20th century presented himself as an expert in Chinese Royalty, with particularly close ties to the throne.  Of course, Backhouse has long been exposed (since 1974) as a historical fraud, but this has not changed the general and traditional view of Tzu Hsi as being a particularly ruthless and unpleasant character in Chinese history.  In fact, in my recent trip to Beijing (formerly Peking) last month, as I toured the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace, my tour guide during her narration of the sights mentioned several "facts" about the Empress and her activities which have been debunked by Seagrave as lies and fabrications from the pen of Backhouse.  Seagrave easily and deftly fills in the background to the history of China in the 18th and 19th century leading up to Tzu Hsi acceding to the throne as Regent, at the time of an increasing foreign interest in China.  Characters are vividly sketched out, ranging from the perceptive Prince Kung, the Empress's brother-in-law who played a significant role in shaping the direction of China for the first decade of Tzu Hsi's rule to Viceroy Li, reputedly at one time China's wealthiest man to the stirrer and malcontent Kang, who played a key role in establishing a negative perception of the Empress in the eye's of the Western world, a perception which many hold to today.  Dragon Lady is as much the tale of the myths and legend makers of Tzu Hsi as Tzu Hsi herself, and how they (Backhouse in particular) achieved what they did.  Dragon Lady is recommended for those interested in Chinese history, particularly the 19th and early 20th century, and the characters, both Chinese and foreign that played key roles in the downfall of the last Chinese dynasty.  Dragon Lady draws upon many sources, some of which is Chinese.  As discussed by Seagrave, popular histories of China by Western authors have tended to rely directly on the writings of Backhouse, or rely on books which relied on Backhouse for source material.  By avoiding these, Seagrave manages to achieve a much more interesting, and balanced, account of a fascinating period in Chinese history.   
 This is the best playhut toy..no poles Just flip open and have fun.. my one year old and my 10 month old LOVE this Bus.. 
 Whitman is not the world's greatest poet - that's probably Shakespeare - but he's certainly been the most influential American poetic voice over the past century. He was the first poet to take all of American life as his subject. Ever the Romantic, Whitman was also the first poet to bring Romanticism into line with everyday reality.  His narcissism can be annoying, but his panoramic descriptions of life and the imagination have a singularly cumulative power.  Some of his short poems ("A Noiseless Patient Spider" and "To a Locomotive in Winter")are individually memorable. The longer poem "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed," indirectly about the Lincoln assassination, is brilliant. I think most of his Civil War poems are overpraised, but "Come Up from the Fields, Father" is a masterpiece of its kind.  On the negative side, Whitman's transcendental philosophy, which he likes to indulge at length, will strike many readers as very sappy.  His style, lots of details piled up on top of one another, grows monotonous, and readers who criticize his lack of traditional poetic craftsmanship cannot just be brushed off. My advice is to not to try to get through it all at once. The poems rarely become "difficult," they just tend to blur one into the other. Which may actually have been Whitman's intention.  Overall,there's never been a book quite like "Leaves of Grass," in any edition, and that's why it keeps selling as a true classic. In other words, a very old book that people still buy and read and enjoy even when no teacher is telling them to. Reading it will get you as close as one book can to actually living in nineteenth-century America, with all its follies, inequities, and promise 
 Unlikely to actually happen, the event which begins this book still leads to an very interesting look into the way that a number of people are affected for years by a very quick and unplanned decision.  Everyone in this book is multi-dimensional and likeable because you grow to feel like you know what motivates them.  The protrayal of the growing up years for a person with Down's Syndrome is very well done--one sees the strengths as well as the limitations.  I thought some of the resolutions of the years of keeping a secret were a bit simplistic and convenient but other than that, I enjoyed this book a lot.  Well worth reading 
 I have ordered this product several times and always had top notch service receiving it in a few days.  The order has arrived in the best of condition 
 Gabriel Campisi has filled a niche with his book by providing technical and practical information necessary for any writer or director looking to fund their project.  While there are other books available on "business plans and investors" in general, Gabriel affirms that writing a business plan for the production of movies is entirely different than most other ventures.  He explains what is required to be successful, and how to go about attaining what is necessary.  The best example in the book is the correlation to the open-air market when comparing it to the movie industry.  Very clever, indeed!  All around a great book, fantastic information, the insights obviously come from someone who has "been there, done that."  A great investment for any library or filmmaker!  Two thumbs up for Gabriel 
 Watson's using Dogdom as a point of reference for human yearnings and frustrations is a master stroke.  Though his blending of hilarity and pathos might be called a characteristic of Southern Lit., his voice and his  insights are unique.  This book is a "keeper.&quot 
 I picked up a copy of 'A Meal To Die For' the other day while in route from Los Angeles to New York, having placed some great expectations on Joseph Gannascoli since I have eaten Joe's delightful cooking, and knowing Joseph, have always been engaged by his giant, inviting charisma.  Well, to my delight (and to my appetites dismay . . . as I had a six hour flight on my hands), 'A Meal To Die For' delivered a fun and engaging read unique in the craft of storytelling since there were wonderful culinary delights to draw from in book.  The idea of the plot line brought me back to the cult classic film 'The Chef, The Wife, The Thief, and The Lover . . . except my own visuals of the character movement were easily identifiable with as a New Yorker.  Overall, Joe Gannascoli offers a delightful novel that readers will truly savor every little morsal of.  If you're like me, and you love to eat and read at the same time, then open this book, turn through the pages to a dish you fancy, run to the nearest grocery store and buy all the necessary ingredients, get back to your house, open a nice bottle of wine, and then start cooking and eating till your heart (and stomach) is content!! 
 "The Wind in the Willows" was first published in 1908, which means Lewis was only 10 years old at the time. So I seriously doubt that Grahame borrowed any ideas from him. "Boxen" was not yet created. If anything, it was Lewis who was probably influenced by Grahame. 
 1. I Wanna Love You Forever Jess's first ever single. It's a sweet ballad which shows off Jessica's strong voice. She should have released this second or third, not first. But it's still great. 5/5  2. I Think I'm In Love With You A cute, catchy little ditty which was the third release. It's singable, infectious and has a cool video. Another good track. 5/5  3. Where You Are (feat. Nick Lachey) A gorgeous song! I love the vocals on this. Nick and Jessica sound brill together. It's a very sweet song that is a definite must-listen. 5/5  4. Final Heartbreak My favorite on the album! It's a catchy, dancy tune with a killer chorus that catches you instantly. I was singing along in seconds. 5/5  5. Woman In Me (feat. Destiny's Child) This song is ok. It gets kind of boring towards the end. You can't really hear Destiny's Child on this track, Jessica drowns them out. It's got a catchy chorus though. 3/5  6. I've Got My Eyes On You Another upbeat, awesome tune. It has a cool chorus which sticks in your head. Definitely listen to this! 5/5  7. Betcha She Don't Love You Why do people say there's too many slow tracks on this CD? This is the 4th fast one in a row! This is just like the last track, upbeat, dancy, and catchy. 5/5  8. My Wonderful The first song I ever knew from Jessica. It's got great music, cool lyrics and a nice message. One of my faves. 5/5  9. Sweet Kisses The wicked title track. It's simple but sweet. It has brill vocals and cool music. Should have been a single! 5/5  10. Your Faith In Me 11. Heart Of Innocent Boring songs. I listened to them once and gave up. Both 2/5  You should definitely buy this CD now if you haven't yet, it's worth it 
 The product came in a timely fashion and was exactly what I wanted.  I have not yet been able to fill up the memory with my camera, but will try to soon

 Future cop Lieutenant Eve Dallas rides again to meet a new foe who threatens the one thing she has ever truly cared for.  Billionaire Roarke, the richest and most handsome man on or off planet, has crossed swords before with the more than shady Max Ricker in the darker days of his past.  While Roarke operates only in the light these days, there are those who would like to see him dragged right back to where he began.   When a young police officer is beaten to death, every local cop wants to give a hand in the hunt to find the killer.  A baseball bat has been used on the off-duty officer who was working nights at a local strip joint called "Purgatory".  For a man known to have no enemies, the brutality of his killing stuns everyone.  It takes some serious digging from Eve and her sidekick Officer Peabody to find a connection to the notorious Max Ricker.  The death of another officer suspected to be on the take to Ricker links the two cases to police internal affairs who would like the whole investigation squashed.   Add a troubled police captain into the mix, and there's a whole lot of people who feature on Eve's suspect list.   The relationship scenes in "Judgment in Death" are some of the best in the series.  If you are an Eve and Roarke fan you'll delight in the spats the dynamic duo have with the additional element of a third party -Eve's pre-marital one night stand, Webster.  The crime plotline meanders to the point that a resolution is just a bonus. Robb is at the top of her form here when it comes to her created 2058 environment of New York and the sharp, witty characters she has populated it with.  Great fun read for fans and would definitely hook in the new reader who has heard great things of the romantic suspense contained in the hugely successful '"in Death" series.   
 This dvd was great but it should be longer and i loved how they put pic of her when she was little 
 One of the best books I have read in a long time. It is touching and funny. Makes you think about family and their meaning.As a Oregonian I could really idenify with every nook and cranny of Portland as Eleanor traveled through the city. The love story was also very sweet. I give the author Jennie Shortridge an A+ for her effort. I hope there are many more delightful books in her head, I will be first in line to buy them.. 
 Maya Angelou provides insight and humour in her book Even the Stars Look Lonesome. The book is a quick read but deservedly warrants several readings.The prose is simple , yet profound coming from a woman who has lived through life's joys and sorrows. The book is rather poetic; at times, it appears as though one were reading her poetry and not prose. Even the Stars Look Lonesome is a book for all to cherish; she provides insight on the joy of aging, commends Oprah Winfrey on her strengths, talks about events in her life that shaped her and people that influenced her. Overall, a joy to read; a book that entertains, educates and makes life a more pleasant journey 
 This product truly works wonders... No it doesn't harm your animal in any way.. The only slight down-side is, at least my dog does this, the animal learns to bark soft enough that the collar won't spray. 
 As a young White boy growing up on the Navajo reservation was very wonderful, this movie brought back many wonderful memories.  The Navajo friends I had, all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of Northern Arizona.  This movie is a great movie, it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880's.  Some what, as I felt when we moved to Northern Arizona in 1960.  The people were wonderful to grow up with.  This movie is a great movie, the only problem I had with the DVD is that to see the Bonus Features you have to have a special computer.  I would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie, if they could have just put it on the DVD.  I would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out, unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts.  Other wise I would have given this movie a 5 star rating 
 Francis Schaeffer's predictions are coming true today!  Schaeffer was an extraordinary apologist and evangelist.  His ministry was rooted and grounded in the basic tenet that the Bible IS the Word of God.  It is  inspired and sufficient.  He was one of the few to see that modern  evangelicalism was quickly drifting from its biblical moorings.  This  volume points out numerous ways in which the church started to drift even  during Schaeffer's lifetime.  New authors such as David Wells are attesting  to the validity of Schaeffer's well written prophecy.  If you're interested  in evangelicalism or the debate concerning the inerrancy and authority of  the Bible then you will love this volume.  This was the forerunner of all  modern discussions concerning the church's constant need to be anchored in  God's inspired Book--the Bible 
 This is flamenco at it's best!  Liebert hypnotizes you with the upbeat and sometimes haunting sounds of the flamenco style of the guitar!  The music touches you and makes you recollect memories of the past.  I love it!  You  will too!  Buy from amazon, this cd is somewhat hard to find, and if you do  find it, it will be expensive. amazon has a good price.  dont make the same  mistake i did.  Other than that, this goes down as a platinum album in my  books.  Great 
 although the soundtrack is fabulous, i would have liked it to have more songs on it...especially the scene where mulan decides to take her father's place, goes to her ancestor's temple, cuts her hair then puts on her father's armo 
 This book is creepy. If you like ghost stories, with a twist its pretty good. I enjoyed this book , however its not my favorite. The reason I gave it a 4 star is because it maintained my interest 
 Excellent. The best book I have seen on the subject 
 I am of the opinion that when a novel is set in a historical time period and in a country that is not the author's own, then the author's language and style should reflect that period and country. Of course, there are exceptions. Modern authors cannot write a book entirely in Latin if setting a novel in ancient Rome, but they can employ a style to suggest a time long gone by. Too often authors do not take this option, perhaps not to put off their readership. However, it is jarring to read a story set in 19th century Britian and have the characters sound like they are from 21st century middle America.  Fortunately, this is not the case with "And Only to Deceive". Tasha Alexander succeeds in her attempt to re-create the feel of 19th century literary diction without seeming too stuffy. Her heroine, Lady Emily Ashton, feels like a genuine Victorian woman and the locales and situations are painted so vividly that they can be easily imagined. The plot itself is unique; it involves a forgery ring of not paintings but antiquities. There is also a splash of romance, but Ms. Alexander deserves a standing ovations for not saddling the reader with a cookie cutter love scene.  There is a sequel planned for spring, and one can only hope it is as charming as this first entry 
 I enjoyed listening to the audio book.  I saw me in a lot of the characters I plan to get the whole collection 
 "Garden Retreats: Creating an Outdoor Sancutary" by Barbara Blossom Ashmun is one of the few garden books on my shelves that has great writing, great content, and great photography.  Her writing is beautifully  sensual as it puts into words the feelings one would have visiting any of  the private West Coast garden retreats described in this excellent book.  She clearly explains how to make the patio, the path,  or decorate the  arbor  that makes the retreat a special hideaway from the rest of the  world.  Allan Mandell is an outstanding photographer whose wonderful  photographs capture the mood and depict Ashmun's words perfectly.  This  book makes creating your own retreat seem like a definitely achievable  goal 
 If ever a gust of fresh air wafted out of the smog of Watergate, the story of Christ coming into the life of Chuck Colson has to be part of it.  I loved this book.  It is a simple, quick, and uplifting read.  Colson rejected a full scholarship to Harvard on a matter of principle, and his grittiness, perseverance, and humbling transformation shine as examples of God's artistic handiwork.  As other readers have mentioned, Colson is extremely forthright and honest, both in recounting his pre-Christian mentality and his post-conversion weaknesses.  He does so to the point of making himself vulnerable and willingly so.  I so much appreciate that decision, as I am sure do many others.  He details the "obvious" at the risk of seeming simplistic, if only because those simple observations stuck with him and impacted him.  One clear example can be found upon his entry to the prison at Maxwell Air Base:  "Not only were all uniforms the same drab brown; so were the expressions on the faces.  Something strange here.  Then it struck me--no one was smiling."  This is a fine book and worth reading.  One final excerpt to encourage you:  "My new friend then handed me a copy of the Phillips version of the New Testament, inscribed:  To Charles--It is better to fail in a cause that will ultimately succeed than to succeed in a cause that will ultimately fail--God bless you!  Doug.  Matthew 6:33.  How those words were to haunt and lead me in the days to come!&quot 
 I decided to read all of the books from this author after browsing her last book (Drinking from the Rain, I believe) and getting absolutely hooked on it. Her writing really appeals to me.  It is not easy for me to understand Sasha, the main character in this book, probably because of the generation gap, but also because I couldn't accept her to be so strong and so weak at the same time. The ending is also very confusing, I didn't expect marriage and maternity to have such a strong effect on her (negative, from my view). I will be checking out here at amazon to see if other people can help me to make sense of the book ending. I intend to read other books from Ms. Alix K. Shulman pretty soon 
 I bought this CD to provide me with another dimension to my studies of period events.  It truly contains a wealth of music, and takes it place as an important addition to my musical library.  Living in the Mt Vernon area, I often travel with the CD playing while visiting historical places, and it provides a wonderful companion to "set the mood" for the myriad locations in the area.  The quality of the sound is remarkable, the musicians superb, and the breadth of song selection provides a musical landscape for the period.  Highly recommended! 
 I had heard of this movie, but I'm particular about what year a movie is made.  Older movies usually bore me but for some reason one day I rented this movie at a video store.  I was blown away!  The acting was excellent the story was incredible and I was pleasantly suprised.  I went out and bought the movie, and the book the next day.  If you have not seen this movie.....watch it!  You won't be disappointed.  Once again Jack proves what an excellent actor he is 
 Alan Lightman is one of the best Science writers living today. He writes with great clarity and imagination. However the book he is most known for is his first, this 'fiction' on Einstein's dreams.  To my surprise the book does not really have a narrative line. And old conservative me most enjoyed in this book those passages in which Einstein was definitely on the scene and we could have , an as it were, realistic view of the greatest scientific genius , the very symbol of science, in our age. I enjoyed the conversations with Besso and the small details telling of Einstein's actions as he prepared and readied his 'Special Relativity' manuscript for publication.  The great bulk of the work however presents Einstein's dreams in a different way. They have no real relation to the specific individual Einstein. They are actually prose- poetry sketches, outlining different kinds of world operating in accordance with different kinds of time. There is a cyclical time world, and a world in which time runs backwards, and a world in which there is 'infinite time in the future ' available to all. Each of the worlds is presented by showing detailed specific realities, often connected with the Switzerland of 1905. Many of the lines and passages here have a suggestive beauty, and the work I think has through them great literary value.  Nonetheless it left me with a sense of disappointment a sense of how it could have gone far more into detailing the mind and life of Einstein.    
     My partner and I read this book years ago and I still remember much of it.. Should be required reading for a sexually mature individual.. If you read this book and do now have a 100percent improvement in your live and love making your not doing it right... you need to re-read it. 
 is a great way to spend time with your loved little ones.  When we had a mama eastern screech owl and her three babies living in our front yard we became interested in this heartwarming story.  Having our own Sarah, Percy and Bill made the story that much more fun to read.  Kim J. Beck 
 It is no easy task to read the recollections of child abuse survivors. Kathleen's book, at over 400 pages, is no easy read. The content is heavy with tragedy. But what is most miraculous about this book is, not only her courage to come forth with her story, but the inspiration she tries to install on the reader.  How do you tell someone they've written a great book when it deals with such horrific themes? While it seems oxymoronic, it isn't. Having been fortunate enough to make Kathleen's acquaintance for a brief period of time, I can say with some authority that she has taken her traumatic experiences and transmuted the resulting anger and energy into something very positive for others. Not just via this book, which must have served as a form of catharsis to expunge inner turmoil, but in daily life as she strives to help and support others who have also been subject to degrading and demoralizing circumstances. The joy and energy she radiates are fascinating even from my own perspective as someone who has led a reasonably "normal" life.   This book is a testament to the power and resiliency of the human spirit. If you enjoy the blatant name-dropping and sensationalism of books such as Cathy O'Brien's "Trance-Formation of America" or Brice Taylor's "Thanks for the Memories..." then this book is not for you. It is clear Kathleen went to great lengths to stick to facts and situations she can corroborate. All of her words were carefully chosen, and the end result is an uplifting story of hope in a world increasingly overrun with chaos 
 this book is great for someone who is just starting out and wants an outline of all of the basics from getting funding, taxes as well as cool marketing ideas. i highly recommend it 
 Just remember "A man a plan a canal Panama" reads front to back and back to front  Great book by a great author.    
 This is a wonderful book (if you are a fan of novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Sun Also Rises) that deals with the frustrations of not only the Indians, but the newcomers to the land as well.  Dr. Aziz, Mrs. Moore, and Adela all deal with the problems that occured during the time period, with a bit of mysticism that confuses the characters unwilling to accept the mysteries of India. Fabulous look at colonization and the many types of people involved 
 I have read upto page 42 out of total 147 pages (excluding answers to Practice Exercises).  I like the book very much and I find it easy to read, logically organised and the coverage and approach is just right!   Besides, the book is handy to carry around (smaller than A4 size and not thicker than 200 pages - this is important for non full-time students).  Moreover, the practice exercises are realistic enough to test your understanding of what you've read.  I highly recommend this book to students, adult learners and really anyone who would like to review ESSENTIAL grammar 
 Bo Marsten is living in the tail end of this century in the "USSA", a place where beer and french fries are outlawed, a good percent of the population is on a Ritalin-like drug, sports can only be played with maximum protective clothing, and manual labor is performed by people arrested for "rage" crimes. Bo's speech and action will seem like a normal teen's to the reader, but he winds up incarcerated for fighting with a classmate over a girl (using his fists, not weapons). He is placed in a work camp run by McDonald's and set in the frigid wilds of Canada. Like "Holes," the wardens are corrupt, the other inmates aggressive, and the environment punishing. Bo manages to become part of an elite group of boys who play football, the old-fashioned kind that is outlawed in the rest of the country. Meanwhile, an A1 program that Bo created in school has mutated and acquired a "life" of its own. The creation, called a web ghost, may just be able to spring Bo from his sentence early.  The book is an original, thought-provoking read. Just a decade ago, kids didn't wear bicycle helmets; could mandatory law be possible in the future? The only flaw is that apart from Bo and the A1, there is minimal character development. In "Holes" the relationship between Stanley and Zero helped give Stanley's character more depth. I also wanted more backstory on Bo. Had he really always had a bad temper, or did it develop when he became a teenager? Did the government/school do other things besides prescribe meds for people who were potential discipline problems?  How did he deal with his father leaving the first time? But I guess those questions were outside the scope of the book.  
 This was a very interesting book about the IMF and its dealing with Argentina. Argentina has had a colorful past of financial blunders including one in 1890 which almost brought down Barings Bank when it defaulted on its bond payments. So it was not surprising when Argentina bankrupted again.  Not only does this book have the inner workings of the IMF with regard to Argentina but it also contains some short stories of average people and the catastrophies that befell them because of Argentina's currency devaluation. I found it interesting that because Argentina guaranteed an exchange rate between its currency and the dollar that a lot of people had taken out loans in dollars which proved to be disasterous when the peso was devalued.  All the information about the behind the scenes action of the IMF was very insightful as to the inner workings of global financing of emerging nations. The author did a good job bringing home the facts and helping the reader get to know the players in both the IMF and the Argentine government. In summary this was a good lesson on the economics of what debt can do to a country. 
 Canin, a writing professor at the University of Iowa, reminds me of Richard Yates in that I refer to each of them as a writer's writer. Both of these writers have very different strengths (and their lives have other points of intersection), but each has a way of producing work that is technically wonderful, while at the same time being an entertaining story. In this instance, Canin weaves a story about August Kleinman, a Jewish man who escaped the Holocaust and fought oversees in the Pacific. The story weaves August at multiple time periods and we jump from perspective to perspective seamlessly. That's the strongest aspect of this novel - the way Canin takes us to different points in August's life, while maintaining our complete and utter belief that this is the same person at different developmental stages in each instance. Another way to look at this novel is through its "tightness." Canin does a great job of linking things together and of providing closure to almost every single detail that he includes. This novel seems like it could have been written in two days or two years.   I highly recommend the book to people who enjoy reading technically saavy material. Rarely will you find work that is successful at pushing itself stylistically without compromising the plotline. Buy it and enjoy. 
 One of the very best books about Tarantino's movies to day, Smith manages to both analyze his movies from a point of view noone else before him has done, and take a look at the man's work in a numer of contexts that matter to his fans. Well-written, full of insight and not too short, this book might very well make it to the top of must-read Tarantino books. (www.tarantino.info 
 *no spoilers* Clint Eastwood gave us history, patriotism and courage in his 2006 film "Flags of our Fathers." He is back now to show us a different insight from that important battle, but this time we get to see behind enemy lines. The Battle of Iwo Jima is now shown from the Japanese perspective in his new film "Letters from Iwo Jima." We recommend this film due to its excellent plot, realism, acting and drama.  Brief story: The beaches look calm and peaceful in present day Iwo Jima. Groups of Japanese scientists are investigating a network of tunnels that their soldiers dug up before the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. Suddenly they find something interesting in the soil and begin to dig up. As they dig, the movie takes us back in time to 1945, days before that fateful battle.  Japanese General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) arrives at the island and begins to plan new strategies to protect it against the American occupation. Unfortunately, many of his troops believe that this battle is lost. They are going against a better equipped and more powerful military force. The General also knows that the war is not going well for his country--he is bombarded with bad radio news from the mainland about the war--but that doesn't stop him from doing his duty honorably. The battle begins and all the Japanese soldiers shift to surviving mode.  Review: Clint Eastwood is back with another epic film where we witness the crude reality of World War II once again. This time around, we get to see the war through the eyes of Japanese soldiers. These brave men who sacrificed everything and fought until the end to protect their island. A small island indeed, but yet crucial for both sides, especially for the Land of the Rising Sun. The Japanese side gives us history, patriotism and courage of its own. We see some of their motives, fears and dreams through flashbacks--something that Clint used heavily in "Fathers"--but done better this time. We get to understand what the word "honor" means to them. Although these two enemies are from different parts of the world, they share similarities like; insecurity, fear of the unknown, patriotism, rage against their enemy, but they also share compassion for one another and strong family values.   The acting is what makes this movie very realistic. Ken Watanabe gives us an excellent performance as the real-life General Kuribayashi. He is a man of honor who must fight his enemy as well as his own demons--his character reminds us a little bit of Katsumoto from The Last Samurai.  The look and feel of the film is virtually the same as "Fathers" where Clint used a dark--almost black & white color--filter. The battle scenes are shown with intensity. The camera work is dynamic and the overall photography is impressive--something that you would definitely expect from a Clint Eastwood film.  Unfortunately the movie suffers from the same illness as "Fathers." Both movies feel longer than they really are due to the draggy editing and talky moments--we believe that the use of flashbacks is something that Clint needs to minimize.  The Verdict: The Battle of Iwo Jima is remembered as a great victory for America--and rightly so--but there is more to tell. "Letters from Iwo Jima" gives us the opportunity to see beyond the American version by focusing on the Japanese one. If you saw "Flags of our Fathers," you won't be disappointed by this companion film--which surpasses the first one in almost every level. 
 When I purchase this cup, I though it was going to be more like a game but let me tell you so far it's been very good and clear on the messages; I actually can say that regarding the subjects I made the questions the explanations where accurate. I know also, that the more you practice the more your intuition will develops but for a beginner this is a great start and I see myself reading the cup soon without the book because the system is easy and quick to learn. It will help if every day your morning coffee you use your cup and in no time you will be having fun with friends reading their future 
 Even though I adore ancient history, the format of most history books is, well, boring.  Uppity Women of Ancient Times defies all sterotypes, though.  With over two hundred women in this book, she dosn't get much room to talk about the individuals, but her wording is brief, modern, and perfectly hilarious.  With this book not only can you relate to the charactors, but you can actually understand why the did the things they did (in most cases, at least).  Full of clever, powerful, and just plain funny women, this book gives meaning to the saying "you go girl.&quot 
 As the editor/author/publisher of "The Closers" series of books/audios/videos/newsletters/seminars, many people seek my opinion on the various sales training materials available in the marketplace. So when "Selling to VITO" first came out, I must've gotten a hundred phone calls and a couple dozen copies of it from my customers/clients, each wanting to know what I thought.   Here's what I think: In addition to my sales training series ("The Closers"), and in addition to all of the other excellent sales material out there that you might select, "Selling to VITO" should be in your sales training library. Why?  Because all of the selling skills on earth won't help you if you can't get in front of the decision maker to begin with . . . and "Selling to VITO" will help you do that. So do it. Grit your teeth and order a copy today!   Note: You may have noticed that all of my book reviews carry "5 Star" ratings(*****). But that's not the sign of a "soft reviewer." I only review books to which I can honestly give a "5 Star" rating. You may assume, therefore, that any sales training/self-improvement book without my "5 Star" rating is either something less than "5 Star," or I simply haven't gotten to it yet . . . and there are certainly plenty of those! 
 This is the second book we've read in the Jesse Bear Series, and we love it as much as the first one, "What Will You Wear Jesse Bear?"  We plan to buy the rest.  The illustrations are wonderful and hold my two year  olds attention as he soaks up all details.  He loves the little bear and  his parents. The rhyming style is very catchy and has enough repetition to  keep a toddler involved.  The book shows a typical toddler (who happens to  be a bear) trying his best to get wet in all sorts of daily activities.  He  is continually thwarted by the warning  "Better not get wet Jesse  Bear!" until his parent bears finally let him loose in his own pool.   My son LOVES to say that line as it is repeated throughout the story and  yell "SPLASH" when Jesse Bear gets to jump into his pool.   Surprisingly, the book made the sublte point to my son about puddles and  such.  When he runs across them now, he shakes his head and says  "better not wet, Jesse Bear&quot 
 Set in New York City, Richard Egielski's version of The Gingerbread Boy is a treat for the eyes.  The illustrations are richly detailed and colorful,  and my 3 year old son loves this modern version.  He and I talk about the  characters and details, telling stories within the story.  Our favorite  illustration shows of a group of construction workers who pause in their  work to chase that irresistible gingerbread boy.  My son really loves the  chase scenes, but the picture of the fox eating the gingerbread boy is a  little scary.  We highly recommend this version to readers 3 and up 
 +Zia is such a awsome story! It is about a girl named Zia who is Karanas neice,she lives at the mission Santa Barbara with her little brother Mando.One day Mando and Zia find a old whale boat that drifted up onto shore and decide to use it to go and rescue Karana from the Island Of The Blue Dolphins. Im not gonna say any more about what happens because you will have to find out for your self 
 I was born and raised in New York state, though now I reside in Rhode Island.  Such being the case, on occasion I have thought to familiarize myself with the history of the state and of New England.  I discovered the book,KING PHILIP'S WAR: CIVIL WAR IN NEW ENGLAND, 1675-1676, by James D. Drake.  I read it because the issues raised in that war continue to bedevil Rhode Island.  A brief resume of the war is that:  In 1675, the Wampanoag Tribe under the leadership of King Philip, also known by his native name, Metacom, rebelled against the English colonies in Southeastern New England with whom they had various alliances, and against whom they had various grievances including the peremptory hanging of two Wampanoags.  (The author is excellent on the causes of the war.)  The Wampanoags were joined by some but not all other tribes in the region.  After initial success in fighting the war, the rebels were defeated by the English settlers, and essentially eradicated.  As part of that war, there occurred, in 1676, in the area now known as West Kingston, RI, a battle called the Great Swamp Fight,in which the Indians were defeated, and the war ended.  The Great Swamp Fight is considered to be the first massacre of native peoples in America.  The reason the war continues to be a factor in Rhode Island is that the remnants of the native tribes, melded into a single tribe now called the Narragansetts, have been attempting to get the right to build a casino under terms of the Indian Gaming Act passed by Congress in 1988.  They have been frustrated in doing so by Rhode Island's leading politicians,---and hypocritically because gambling exists in other venues in Rhode Island, and is increasing.  (The politicians pander to the moral sense of the people while advancing gambling in other guises.  Further, prejudice is involved because the Narragansetts intermixed with the descendants of African slaves, though of course the politicians deny it.)  The Narragansetts obviously are considered a threat, though there are hardly 3000 of them, as compared to about 1 million residents of the state!  Further again, there continues to this day to be litigation about the Narragansetts attempting, a few years ago, to open a smoke shop where federal and state taxes were not collected on tobacco products.  The Rhode Island State Troopers, under the Republican Governor Don Carcieri, forcibly closed the smoke shop, though now it is admitted that force was not needed but that legal warrants could have accomplished its closing until the issue of sovereignty could be decided.  Further once more, it is impossible to get away from associations with that era.  Indian names are part of every section of the state.  The Wampanoag Trail is a major highway from Providence to the communities on the eastern part of Narragansett Bay.  Nearby to where I live, there are the names of streets:  Metacom, Pokanoket, Massasoit, and on and on.  I live on Wamsetta Avenue.  Finally, neither is it possible to avoid the names of the English settlers who prosecuted the war in the New England colonies:  Winslow, Winthrop, Coddington, Church, Cotton, Denison, Eliot, Mather, Gorton---I could go on and on with such names, also.  These names fill the telephone books, and those persons are related to the colonial figures, in some manner.  I agree with Drake that King Philip's War was not a racially premeditated war of the English settlers against the Native American tribes.  However, that might be a close call.  As the author is careful to point out, while some of the Indians, in tribal groups and as individuals, fought with the various English colonies, none of the English colonists sided with the rebels.  Furthermore, the Native American tribespeople were greatly outnumbered by the English, on the order of about 18 thousand to about 60 thousand.  And with the English way of fighting, which was annihilatory (both the Indians of that time and the author condemn it), the outcome was predictable.  I also agree with Drake that the origins of America are multiple and not exclusively linear from the New England colonies.  However, neither is the 17th century experience of those colonies discontinuous with the development of the United States,---even though there are many "Americas," from colonial, to revolutionary, to the national period, to civil war, to the rise of finance capitalism (the Gilded Age), to immigrant, to the Great Depression Era, to WWII, industrial, cold war, Vietnam, etc., etc.  I came to intellectual awareness in the early 1960s and know from personal experience that that era differs so much from the era of Bush II, 9/11 and the Iraq War fiasco as to comprise a different and distinct political entity.  But America is a case of "e pluribus unum" not only with persons but with politico-economico-cultural eras.  There is a grisly contemporary note in Drake's fine book.  We know of the barbarity of the Islamic terrorists in decapitating some western hostages.  The Native American tribes that rebelled against the English colonies were considered to have committed treason because they had made certain alliances with those colonies.  That was English law in the 17th century.  It is doubtful that the tribespeople understood the English law.  However, the penalty for committing treason was to be drawn and quartered.  King Philip was killed in the Great Swamp Fight.  Nevertheless, his corpse was dragged out of the bog and the punishment was administered to it.  (In case you do not know what it means to be drawn and quartered, I will tell you.  First, the head is cut off.  Then the body is separated at the waist, and the torso and legs are each halved.)  Surely, the Islamic terrorists are barbaric, and just as certainly were the 17th century colonists, and so are we who are their direct descendants, as described above.  In fact, reading Drake's fine, precise, well-researched and well-written book it appears to me less that I am engaged in an exercise of the understanding of ancient, local history than in reading a subtext to the daily news.

 McSweeney's sent out Part One as a preview with the quarterly.  I was already looking forward to reading the whole book, since the few stories Adrian put out recently are so twisted and beautiful.  Anyway, it didn't disappoint.  Suspend your disbelief and just go with it--the writing is poetic and the story very encompassing.  Loved it 
 Another great album from a band whose glory days are ahead of them. All of the dark and desolate enviornment of a post-industrial Manchester is captured in every note of this album. 
 When my son turned four, he started making pictures with a pen.  He showed no particular talent, but his chicken scratches sometimes looked cute.  That's when I did a search on Amazon looking for children drawing instruction books.   The Ed Emberley's series popped up, and I picked Make a World in addition to 3 others.  At first my child just looked at the books and smiled, so I started him out by drawing a blimp myself, showing him how to follow each step in the book.  After he watched me do it, he also drew a blimp, following the simple picture instructions nicely (he couldn't read at all.)  I then showed both blimps to my husband; he said he couldn't tell the difference.  I couldn't either.  From that day on, my son spent 4, 5 HOURS per day with Make a World and drew various things in the book.  With no encouragement from me!  My mother was impressed, because my son is normally a hyperactive monkey that you can't tie down!  Some of the instructions are very small, but he doesn't seem to have any trouble.  The book lasted him months.  If nothing else, it was a wonderful babysitter!  I showed some of his pictures to my friends; all were impressed that a four-year-old can draw such detailed, complex pictures.  The trick is showing him how.  I am a math teacher and I don't care for art normally.  However, I believe that drawing everyday objects at a younger age will help a child's spatial conception, which will be beneficial later towards learning geometry and trigonometry.  That's just my opinion.  If you only want to get one Ed Emberley book, get this one because it has everything. (though the others are great too!) 
 This is an ambitious book that succeeds. Based on several real events, it encompasses the Hindu-Muslim conflict, centuries old, the history of India itself, American naivete, corporate behavior in foreign countries, and the tragedy of people deeply emotionally ... involved in a relationship that has no future. The author leaves the reader with the hope that diverse peoples in the same country won't end up the same way. The style, with multiple points of view and "chapters" in different formats, e.g., diaries, newspaper articles, narratives, dialogues as in a play, is very difficult to pull off, and most writers don't succeed. They end up losing and confusing the reader. This author makes it work. I give a book 5 stars when it provokes thought and curiosity, tells me about something new, and makes me want to learn more. This book did it all 
 In general I find this to be a very good book. The writing is lucid, to the point, and free of prejudice. However, in some instances where the facts regarding a composer's life is unclear, Dubal presents the version that he believes is true as fact. For example, Dubal says that Tchaikovsky died of cholera after drinking unboiled water. In at least one other instance (the liner notes to a Tchaikovsky CD I own but forgot which one) the author claims that Tchaikovsky was forced to consume poison after the authorities found that he was a homosexual. And to call Schumann an "important" symphonist is laughable. Everyone knows as great as  Schumann is at writing for the piano, he was equally inept at writing for the orchestra.  Another problem I have is Dubal's selection of recommended recordings. He recommends anything and everything that Solti recorded. I know Solti is a great conductor but come on. There are some absolute classics of the repertoire that he leaves out such as C. Kleiber's recordings of Beethoven's 5th and Brahms 4th. 
 Kipling did an excellent job in compliling and communicating these stories.  I thoroughly enjoyed each story, with the exception of the one about how writing was invented, which seemed a bit boring to me. Kipling had me rolling with laughter with each of the stories, and most of the time his notes on his pictures were the funniest parts (well, this picture doesn't have anything to do with the story, but it does have an armadillo in it...). This book is a true classic, and it is unfortunate that it seems to have fallen out of favor with our present culture.  Perhaps this has something to do with a few racist remarks in the book, or the swastika in some of his pictures (it was a part of Kipling's official logo long before the Nazi's took it).  In either case, these things need to be looked over as a product of their age, and they should not in the least dampen the fun to be had in reading this book 
 I read this book before I had a consultation with Pamala Oslie. The contents were so fascinating and informative that I shared the book with my husband. We both recognized the yellow life color description fit him perfectly, and we still talk about the characteristics of our life colors and what we feel others around us have as their aura colors. For us, it explains a lot about who we are and why we act the way we do. We can also in all likelihood predict others' future behavior.  Knowing and accepting your negative life patterns and the indications of being out of power can assist in surmounting self-defeating behavior and choosing new beliefs. In this sense, you can take responsibility for what happens in your own life and be your own authority.  When completing the individual color assessments it is vitally important to honestly answer each question. After my consultation I looked back at one of the colors I was told I have in my aura, and I saw how I previously rejected it because I felt there were too many negative characteristics. I then could honestly accept this as who I am, and work on bringing myself back in power as suggested by Pamala.  My rating of 5 stars is intently based on the book and not my experience with the author. However, I would like to describe my interaction because it serves to support her credibility. I had a most interesting session with Ms. Oslie; she related many things she could not have had prior knowledge of. Her descriptions of other people in my life were exact. Ms. Oslie's insights of my beliefs and self-realizing goals have been extremely useful. Her level of understanding, wisdom, ethics and professionalism is unmatched by others in her field, which is typically dotted with charlatans and other individuals of questionable abilities. I was left with no question about the authenticity of Ms. Oslie's abilities to correctly intuit many aspects of my life.       
 For the most part, I really enjoyed this book. Krinard makes werewolves real and serves up emotional tension with a backhoe. Braden is a complex hero, and not always heroic, but he recognizes his errors and grows as a character. Cassidy remains somewhat innocent throughout the book, but that's part of what appeals to Braden; plus, the hurt and betrayal that strike at her innocence are beautifully rendered, making the reader hurt, too. Her need to be belong is palpable. You can feel the heightened tension when the werewolves are together and challenging each other. There are moments when the book falters (for example, Bredan's fall into his grandfather's outlook and behavior is never fully explained), but it serves as a thorough introduction to the Forster family. The love scenes are the weakest part, and Krinard's euphemisms are so laughable as to almost be more uncomfortable than crass words. Sometimes the exposition is too long or slow, but once the action begins, it moves with good speed 
 ...I could almost say "poetic " and usefull. Better than the rest!Well written and simply explaine 
 I connected this Cavalry 250 to my systems (plural) and within minutes I was backing up (and restored) my home computer in no time.  The external drive is small enough it fits on my desk using minimal space.  I combined this with GHOST and now have a dependable method of keeping my data safe as well as a dependable recovery from major system failures.  I am a Network admin but, even a novice can do this... 
 I've been staring at a copy of Thomas Friedman's 'From Beirut to Jerusalem' on my shelf for nearly a year now, meaning to read it but always drawn to something else.  Finally, recent events demanded that I learn more and I finally pulled it down, dusted it off, and read it.  I'm so glad I did, especially now.  The book is not the easiest read, since it delves into a lot of regional history and politics, which gets complex no matter what you do.  Friedman's writing style, however, goes a long way towards making the text quite accessible for just about anyone, and his unique perspective on the events that he witnessed and covered in his role as a journalist keeps it interesting and always relevant.  What I really appreciated about the way Friedman presents his story is that it really is HIS story.  He is obviously a man gifted with a keen sense of observation, and so he picks up on many details others might miss, such as the faces of Israeli soldiers or the opinions of Lebanese taxi drivers.  But still, the story is told mainly through events he observed directly -- he just happened to be there for many of the events that shaped the Middle East as it is today.  He tells it in both large and small terms, from some of the politicians he met and interviewed to discussions he had with neighbors and colleagues while living in the region.  The result is that you get the broad spectrum of what was going on in the region, particularly in the 1980's, a critical decade of events.  I also appreciated Friedman's fairness throughout the book. From his perspective on the Lebanese government to the Palestinian intifada to the Israeli occupation to the American involvement in the region, he deals with all of the players fairly, whether big or small, famous or unknown.  That's not to say he doesn't have criticisms -- certainly, he has plenty to say about everyone...but one is never left with the feeling that he has been too harsh on one side and lenient on the other.  Friedman's willingness to observe with an unbiased eye and ear is key to the strength of this book.  Even with the newer added chapters, dealing with the late 1980's and early 1990's, this book cannot be considered a "complete" history of the Middle East, or even of the events of the last 50 years.  However, it is not meant to be that, I think.  What Friedman has documented here is an excellent primer for anyone interested in learning more about how we got to where we are today in Lebanon and Israel and Palestine.  The book is not an end in itself, but for someone who wants to learn more about the region that is in the news almost every day, this is an excellent place to start.  The only way to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past is to learn from them. As such, 'From Beirut to Jerusalem' should be required reading today 
 This is a great book in that John discusses how the show "Crossing Over" in reality allowed him to cross over from being an unknown to a national and well respected psychic medium. John's book escapes the ordinary story line that is typical of this genre and instead moves his audience to a level that is fun filled and interesting right from the start. He candidly reflects himself as a person just like the rest of us thus making the connection between audience member and psychic medium more meaningful. By glimpsing into his world as both a psychic medium and as a human being we begin to realize that we ourselves are all connected. Perhaps this is just one reason why John's stories are always heartfelt 
 The very first Powerman 5000 song I heard was "When Worlds Collide." At that point I though this band was nothing short of Metal geniuses! I spied with my musical eye, "Tonight the Stars Revolt!" by these dudes, so I thought, "hell, why not?" and bought the CD. I was pleased with what I found but not amazed as I thought I would be...allow me to explain.  What I expected was something like a 21st Century "White Zombie." However, in place of the dark and odd appeal of "White Zombie" was a slighlty more humorous and equally as odd inertia. That doesn't detract from the album by the way, I sometimes enjoy a bit of "humour" or even a bit of blatant cheesiness in my Metal! My favourite song was "When Worlds Collide" at first, but after hearing track 6, "Tonight the Stars Revolt!" I quickly changed my mind. This song has an awesome, bone-crushing riff that pulls "When Worlds Collide" down a few notches. The song pounds in the beginning and then falls off and reaches a climax once again with the lyrics that shout, scream and whisper. The song has a great range of techniques and pretty much summarizes what Powerman 5000 is really capable of.  Another song that is a standout track in my opinion is "They Know Who You Are." It's similar in structure to track 6, but is more energetic and erratic in a sense. It has some jarring guitar parts and a couple of quieter parts that build tension in the song. It's really terrific and definitely a song to headbang to. "Operate, Annihilate" opens up with a cool, groovy base and is followed by crunching guitars at regular intervals. The rhythm is tight and the band demonstrate how slow songs and changing time signatures can be highly appealing. Yet another really awesome song. "Super Nova Goes Pop" is pretty much a straight-up metal track that uses some brilliant riffage and samples to create a very entertaining and overall cool song.  Songs that I didn't quite enjoy were "Let the Good Times Roll" which seemed more like an attempt at recreating Glam Metal through Techno-metal. Just not quite my style I guess. It's an OK song but nothing special. "Watch the Sky for Me" is kinda like an epilogue of the whole album and isn't really a song I guess. It's just kinda silly and is more like a swing / jazz version of Powerman 5000. It's very melodic and kinda funny, but a song that most metal fans will just skip or forget about.   The album is excellent overall and gets 85% according to my percentage rating. It's certainly a very original and innovative, not to mention entertaining and kick-ass offering. I would recommend it to fans who like their Metal fresh and exciting and aren't afraid of experimentation, much like a young girl's first kiss with her best friend. However, if you like your metal strongly classical and don't enjoy humour, experimentation and techno-blended metal, then stay the hell away from Powerman 5000. Make your choice, but whatever anybody else thinks, Powerman 5000's "Tonight the Stars Revolt!" is a winner in my book 
 It is with great pleaser that I review my all time favorite Armenian story which my grandfather used to tell me. Nonny Hogrogian did a great job of translating this story. The text is almost exactly translated. The illustrations are a perfect resemblance of Armenian characters. The vast fields remind me of the rigorous landscapes of Armenia. Nonny Hogrogian did an excellent job depicting the culture.  The story is cumulative, similar to There Was An Old Lady Who Swallowed A Fly and Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears. It teaches a great lesson and is bound to be an all time favorite of many children.  
 I am amazed this collection doesn't have like 200 reviews praising it... and likewise 200 from right-wingers and other fundamentalists trashing it... this is an amazing collection.  Most spreads have the cartoon on the right page, with the author's commentary on the left... tells you when it was drawn, where he got the ideas, and more detail into the ideas.  Or, sometimes he's just being bloody funny.. and this guy is!  Like Rall, Tomorrow, Fisgon, Crumb?  You'll love Kreider's take on our current troubled times 
 I used this book (and Rev. Younkin) for my daughter's wedding three years ago. Now I'm using it for my own. This is an excellent tool for planning your ceremony. I can't recommend it enough 
 If you are into Led Zeppelin or not, just buy this.  It gives you TONS of vintage concert footage that show exactly how the band played and sounded back during their peak.  The best part about it is that it is not "over produced" like the music today.  Today's music is overly digitized studio recorded music that is a phony representation of the musicians.  Instead, this is authentic, sincere, and live.  This DVD shows what rock music is REALLY about 
 This book was quite the page turner for anyone with an eating disorder, or just wanting to understand an eating disorder.  The amazing story of one man's journey not only with binge eating but with life itself.  It is very easy for me to read a book and stop if the book doesn't grab me.  I was awake all night reading this witty any exceptionally well written book.  Hooray Ron, you've got me hooked!  
 This continuation of the Anne series on screen is very well done, and captures the flavor of the characters and story as well as the first installment did.  The only problem is that it drastically condenses the three books it supposedly covers.  What it really does is just focus on a few key incidents, and drastically truncates Anne's college and teaching experiences.  Morgan Harris and family have been created to very basically cover the story components of Roy Gardner, Sophy Sinclair, Old Mrs. Gibson and Pauline, and Elizabeth.  This installment ends with Anne and Gilbert becoming engaged.   I highly recommend it - just don't expect the same level of detail as "Anne of Green Gables" provided 
 the story is dynamic and great.  the cast is perfect and the cinemaphotography was spot on.  
 The full panoply of the Victorian Age is put on display in this essential book:  royalty idiotic and benign, doubting divines, philosophers materialistic and otherwise, artists, authors, politicians and aristocrats, all supported by a working class (and farmers) who toiled and, surprisingly to followers of the sorry tale of revolutionary socialism on the continent, did not rise in revolt.  Why this did not happen, pace previous reviewers on this site, makes for a fascinating story.  Wilson explains this paradox in a tour de force of historical writing that should satisfy historians of quantity as well as the heirs of Gibbon who make of history an elegant art.  Wilson's schematic is to break up the era into chronological decades each of which is dominated by the salient issues/personalities.  N.B.  you will need at least to have heard of some of these people and issues as Wilson has neither space nor inclination to explain everyone and everything to the uninitiated.  For example, the eternal duet of Disraeli and Gladstone are limned by the reflections of the era; you are expected to know something of whence they came.  The same holds for personalities as diverse as Darwin and Wilde and issues as wide-ranging as the Reform Bills and Mesmerism.  Peter Gay may have delved deeper, but what one-volume history could?  Even Gibbon could have used some judicious editing as with his unedifying chronicle of the endless quarrels of the Alexandrine Church.  Wilson is nothing if not even-handed.  Even so, he gives us such gems as:  "Gladstone's earnest desire to improve the human race made him popular with Nonconformist Northern grocers".  Indeed.  As another example Wilson puts paid once and for all to the reputation of Pius IX while also making a convincing case for the greatness of Cardinal Manning (the historically omnipresent Cardinal Newman suffers in comparison).  The book's treatment of the horrible working and living conditions of the industrial workers, Irish peasants and the poorer denizens of the large cities should serve as a corrective to those who think of Victorian life as something reflected on Quality Street candy tins.  Marx may have been  perplexed by the failure of all this misery to lead to revolution but, despite earlier critics, Wilson gives, to my mind, a rational explanation of why the the Boer War and the death of Queen Victoria, for example, concentrated the minds of the 'lower' classes more than quotidian miseries.  Beginning in 1834 with the burning of the Houses of Parliament and ending with the dead Queen Victoria floating past warships of many nations in 1901, judicious readers of this book will be astounded by the breadth of Wilson's learning.  Enjoy this book for what it is:  a discursive, sometimes idiosyncratic, always entertaining look at an era that reverberates to this day 
 When I started this book, I could not put it down before I finished it. For a month after that, I could not think of anything else but what I have read, and for the next twenty years I had countless occasions to see that the book was profoundly right. The book was written for a lay reader, simple and fun to read, and yet, I am sure that it will be seen as one of the most influential science books of the 20th century. History and sociology have two periods: before and after The Third Wave by Alvin Toffler 
 The book The emperor by Herbie Brennan is an interesting book for all ages. This book is a sequel to the book Faerie Wars. The book Faerie wars is also a great book.If you love faerie tales and real life stories you would love this book. The book Purple Emperor is about Princess Blue, Prince Prygus, Mr.Frogarty, and Henry and theire adventures. Prygus is destined to become the purple emperor, the person who rules over faerie world. Prygus has many enemies including an evil dark faerie, Hairstreak, who wants to become the purple emperor. Hairstreak has to get through Prygus, Blue, Henry, Mr. Frogarty, and many others to become the purple emperor. The bad thing is that Hairstreak has both Pyrgus's and Blue's fathers' body which he has turned into a walking zombie which he controls. What would they do to destroy Hairstreaks plan of becoming Purple Emperor 
 Our toddler loved the illustrations of the animals .  This book can be  very interactive for young children allowing them to make all the animal  sounds as the book unfolds.  I would definitely recommend this book 
 This is one of my all time favorite movies!  Ranks up there with Weird Science and From the Hip 
 This Pink Panther film is the best one that I've seen. I've seen The Pink Panther, A Shot In The Dark, Inspector Clouseau, this one, and The Pink Panther {2006}. It has great slapstick comedy by Peter Sellers and the rest of the cast. Speaking of the cast, here they are. Peter Sellers as Inspector Jacques Clouseau, Christopher Plummer as Sir Charles Litton {Lytton}, Catherine Schell as Lady Litton, Herbert Lom as Cheif Inspector Charles Dreyfus, Peter Arne as Colonel Sharky, and of course, Burt Kwouk as my favorite character, CATO. He's awesome! That was my review. Jedi40 
 I never heard of this series until recently, all I can say it that it is funny as hell. I've already purchased 3 and 4 and looking forward to 5 and 6 
  Jimmy Nash and Tess Bailey are together again.  Well sort of.  Several months ago, Tess, a computer analyst, helped Nash save his best friend and colleague Decker from a potential hit.  With the adrenaline running high and eyes wide open, Nash and Tess had a one night stand after all was said and done.  Now, they are part of a team sent to Kazbekistan to help recover a laptop with enough information that could put a major dent in the fight against terrorism.  Can these two work together or will their attraction get them killed?  Flashpoint is a fast paced, edge of your seat thriller set in Kazbekistan.  Nash is a bad ass agent who plays hard and works harder.  His nonchalant attitude has gotten him in trouble more than once.  In the case of Tess, his best friend Decker has some feelings for her that Nash either fails to realize or can't resist.  It's an interesting subplot of two friends attracted to the same woman.  At first, I didn't know who I wanted to root for, but as the plot thickened Nash seemed to be the better choice despite his dark side.  He has enough personal issues to fill a book, but with Tess he shows a softer edge.  He begins to care about her as a person rather than a potential lay or fellow agent.  The moments of tenderness he shows made me realize he is a good man.  He just doesn't know how to express himself.  He has been an agent for so long that I don't think he knows how to be anything else.  It's like he doesn't know where his life as an agent ends and he, as a person, begins.  Tess is an awesome computer analyst, but a green field agent.  On her first assignment, she is out of her element.  In Kazbekistan, she sees the worst that reality has to offer but still remains upbeat.  Her optimism was a breath of fresh air even in the darkest times.  I admired her stubbornness and love for Nash because she could see the person he could be under all of the arrogance and attitude.  Yet she would not ask for more than what he could offer.  She would not beg him to love her.  It was all or nothing for her.  Flashpoint is my first Suzanne Brockmann book, but definitely not my last.  The characters are richly detailed and flawed.  Tess, Nash and the secondary characters are real.  Under the harshest conditions, they do and see things that would make a normal person cringe.  I was riveted by the story and all of the subplots that were seamlessly interwoven throughout the book.  Each one helped drive the story, not diminishing the overall storyline.  I could not stop reading because I needed to know what happened next.  I hope each of the secondary characters will have their own story because they are so fascinating.  Flashpoint is a wonderful thriller that will keep you riveted until the last page.   Lee Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewe 
 I'm pleased with the quality of this lunch box. Having two separate insulated compartments is very nice. The salt & pepper shakers are a nifty extra. Just make sure and keep the box right side up or the shakers will pour out.  I haven't owned this product very long, so I can't vouch for its durability. It appears to be very well made with quality materials.  This box may be a bit pricier, but the quality, extra compartment and flatware/shaker pocket are worth it. Using this on a daily basis at work instead of eating out will pay for its self in a month or so. 
 This CD is one of the most complete collection of Elvis ballads and loves songs available.  While there have been other CDs made of his ballads, these are among his best!  I like "A Fool Such As I," "The Wonder of You," and "Pocketful of rainbows."  As other reviewers stated, the only out of place track is "Old Shep" (about a boy and his dog) which though very sad, just doesn't belong here.  Still, I'd recommend this ballad CD because the collection is so complete.  You could amass many other separate CDs and still not have all the great tracks recorded in one place here.  It is a double CD - double the songs for the money.  This a a perfect CD to give as a gift to that "certain someone" in your life.  Enjoy !   I give this 5 stars !  Was this helpful to you 
 It'd been a long time (a decade or so) since I read this Elizabeth Gaskell classic before I watched the BBC adaptation on DVD and loved it.  Rereading this novel was the best decision I could have made because I hadn't appreciated it then the way I did now.  North and South captures the social divide and how the manufacturing and trading industries were revolutionizing in the 1850s.  Margaret Hale, the daughter of a respectable clergyman, and her family move from the south of England to the industrialized northern town of Milton after her father leaves the church because of his conscience.  Margaret is appalled with Milton and the vulgar, uncouth ways of tradesmen and merchants, whom she also sees as uncivilized and cruel.  However, will she change her mind after she meets and gets to know the dashing Mr. John Thornton?  There are many twists throughout the novel.  I was able to appreciate the romance and building of tension between Margaret and Mr. Thornton now, especially after having watched the BBC miniseries and the wonderful Richard Armitage playing Thornton.  Right now, to me, there are four memorable classic literary heroes -- Mr. Darcy, Heathcliff, Mr. Rochester and now Mr. Thornton.  He is gentler and not as brooding here as he is portrayed in the miniseries, but he is as compelling as I had remembered him.  The last few pages are my favorite, especially this line: "While she sought for this paper, her very heart-pulse was arrested by the tone in which Mr. Thornton spoke.  His voice was hoarse, and trembling with tender passion, as he said: `Margaret.' " What a romantic line and I wish it had been added to the miniseries.  The ending at the train station in the miniseries is wonderful (if a bit anachronistic), but it would have been even better if the aforementioned line had been incorporated into the scene.  All in all, this is one of my favorite Victorian classics.  Elizabeth Gaskell isn't quite as known or as celebrated as Dickens or the Brontes, people who had been big friends of hers, according to her biography, but she was a gifted writer in her own right and her talent shows in this wonderful gem which I will reread again in the not-so-distant future 
 I expected more guite solos and more rock-music rather than quiet country style. Knofler should have stayed with Dire Strai 
 While there are three complete 1 mile programs on this DVD, I prefer the EASY WALK session. It has a lot of arm movements which really helps those of us who make our living sitting infront of a computer, with minimal arm movements.  The EASY WALK session is easy to follow, but until you've done it three or four times, you may find yourself a little mixed up. Now, I can follow along with my eyes closed, not that I do mind you.  What I like to do is do four of the EASY WALK sessions back to back, that allows me to get in a four mile walk and break a sweat.  The FAT BLASTING INTERVAL is okay, but it reminds me of an aerobic work out, not a walking work out.  As for stretching and warming up, there's a ten minute stretching routine you can do before or after any work out.   Update: I recently incorporated the the third session. It uses hand weights and I've found that it really helps me increase the intensity. In fact, my 70 year old mother-in-law did this series during a recent visit and she now wants a copy of the DVD. 
 I live in Israel. We live with terrorism daily and I have been following the events worldwide in the news for many years.  This book does an excellent job of summarizing the history of various terror groups, their changing techniques, failures and successes.  HH 
 My 5 year old son really enjoyed playing with the fusion crew pieces and I finally got the fusion dome and he loves it. I was able to buy the Fusion Dome and all of the fusion crew pieces at Dollar stores. I paid $7.99 for the dome at Conways and $1.50 for a pair of figures at the Dollar store. I paid a total of less than $30.00 for what would have cost $100.00. For those of you that want extra fusion crew figures, check out your Dollar stores and Conways. Your kids will thank you for it 
 As a young 87 year-old, Dorothy is a lively character who lives on a farm in small-town Partonville.  She loves God, her family and friends, and her dog Sheba.  Even tho Dorothy has had her share of tragedy, she finds the humor, joy and blessings of life, sticks by her old friends and welcomes new ones.  And through Dorothy we become acquainted with many of the town locals.  This is an easy-going story and so refreshing to be reminded what's important in life!  This is the second book in the series (I enjoyed the first as well), and plan to read the remaining books to find out what Dorothy is up to next 
 I am 40 and listen to jazz since I was a child, as my father was a jazz fan. I play and teach guitar, and have a musical education background. I still do not know why, but since the beginning of the year (2004) I got much more deeply in love with music and specifically jazz - I work listening music, I listen music driving, at home etc. and I have probably purchased about 150 jazz CDs this year. This is certainly the one I like the most. I have listened to the whole CD about 4 or 5 times, and all of them were among the greatest aesthetic experiences I had. This CD is fantastic. I've been learning to enjoy Garbarek, and actually like all his CDs I have purchased until today, but this one is the great of the greatest. It is a journey. It is incredible a group of people could have composed and played such music. You feel transported to another dimension of reality, you feel hypnotized, you feel totally involved with the players and the music. A unique experience, from those that make living worth.  
 A while ago, I received an Amazon gift certificate which I spent on this product.  Reviewing utensils and appliances is not my thing but I feel obligated to say that after Amazon did its usual fine job with prompt delivery, we have found this item a very useful addition to our household.  Like so many, I guess, we are struggling financially.  We therefore try to eat a lot of soups and stews.  This crockpot uses heat very efficiently and turns out exceptionally well blended meals every time.  I'm very glad I bought it and I think it would be of value to anyone in the same position as my family and myself.  Five stars!! 
 This set of four short books sets up one of the best book series in ST writing.  This would make a great TV show!  The characters are skillfully and well crafted.  The action and drama is well balanced.  There was "just enough" use of STTNG and STOS characters to color in a great begining to a great series of books!!  Once you read this one, you'll read the rest as well 
 I'm a guitar player. Recently someone I respect suggested that if I studied a precussion instrument it would improve my guitar playing. Initially I wanted to study congo drums but realized quickly that they were not only very expensive, but a little intense for the condo in which I live. I settled on bongos both for their portablility and for their less intrusive tone. Now the challenge was how to learn them. I've had a lot of pleasure learning guitar from DVD and video tape so my first thought was to find a DVD that taught bongo drumming. Unfortunately the two offered on Amazon had fairly poor customer comments. I always go by the customer reviews because customers have no axe to grind. I find the truth generally come out in these reviews. Finally I hit on Trevor Salloum's The Bongo Book which had rave reviews. I was so enthusiastic I bought the 'better together' deal and also got Beyond Basics. Let me tell you, it's going to be months if not years before I need that second book. I've never worked  with a more comprehensive music book than The Bongo Book. The Martillo and its variations are challenging and also so much fun to play. I go into another world while I'm hammering these tattoos. I just love it. I'm currently on page 15 of 37 musical pages and I already feel like I'm a bongoseros. I've really become obsessed with these things! I've never been attracted to drums before. I'm doing this entirely as an educational adjunct, and it's absolutely changed my image of myself. I'd recommend that anyone learn these little drums before they take up any other instrument. Rhythm is the foundation of all music and once you've got this you can apply it to everything, be it music, dancing, loving or fighting. It's really infectious. There are a couple of suggestions I'd make for future editions: The included CD was among the reasons I initially opted to buy the book but I found this CD not to be very useful or even necessary. I expected it to be a CD I could play along with, but it isn't really. It amounts to a demonstration of how each of the drummed measures is supposed to sound. If you know how to count a musical measure, you really don't need these demonstrations. And if you don't know how to count a measure, these demonstrations are not going to help you to play them. More useful would be a two-page explaination of how to count 4/4 time, 1 and 2 etc, and-a, e-and-a, trip-pel-let etc. I already knew this from studying guitar so had no trouble adapting, but a complete musical beginner would find this kind of explaination useful and essential. This way, the CD could contain play-along rhythms which would be more fun and interesting. I'm buying Jack Costanzo and Armando Peraza CDs to play with and as an example of how the bongos sound in context and this would not be as imperative if the CD contained more of that type of information. Another wonderful thing about this book are the interviews at the end with famous bongoseros, a great opportunity to learn about the significance of this instrument in jazz and popular music as well as the great recordings of bongos that have been made during the 20th Century. I recommend this book without reservations. Learning to count musically is not a great challenge. You can learn the entire concept in under an hour if you don't know how to do it. Salloum's stroke notation is brilliant and easy to memorize and use. For me, I couldn't be happier with a learning tool than I am with The Bongo Book. 
 A nifty widget of the highest order. It projects on the ceiling automatically corrected time and outdoor temperature. In addition it tells indoor temperature and weather predictions at least as good as the local weatherman. Most alarms enrage when awakening, this one is very pleasant but persistent if necessary. The instruction manual seems like it was written by someone that had a taxi waiting but you can stumble through to the correct setting in time. I am very happy with this item 
 bendis is always a reliable writer, and he does a good job with these stories that w/ another writer would've just been filler. the first three issues (#11-13) bring the team to japan where hydra and the hand are trying to use the silver samurai to join forces, but the ending is too abrupt and clearly leaves the situation open to future story arcs. we do have the plus of some great fight scenes, attention given to spider-woman, and the reappearance of a character that fans of the daredevil series will enjoy seeing back in action. the 8-page story from giant-size spider-woman #1 and issues #14 and 15 are more interesting, w/ the full story about how spider-woman got her powers back and who she's working for, the public debut of the new avengers, as well as some insight into where ms. marvel's headed. david finch's art is as good as ever, and frank cho's is worthwhile as well. not one for the ages, but a good read and it'll have you looking forward to vol. 4 
 I am another victim of a Fluoroquinolone, just like the author's wife. Take this book very seriously, because what doctors tell you is 'rare' is in fact extremely common. Levaquin (one of the fluoroquinolones) caused me to develop Fibromyalgia. For a time I had to use a walker. I was in constant pain for nearly one full year. Although the doctors say this is 'rare', three other women in my office of 30 people also developed Fibromyalgia after taking one of these pills. In my realm of family and friends, I have discovered nine others...each and every single one had a doctor telling them they did not know the cause of their pains. Each and every single one took a Fluoroquinolone pill before getting these terrible pains that never go away. No doctor will admit to it, and so therefore it goes unreported, and continues to falsely be considered a 'rare event'. There is a group of victims on yahoo that number more than 1600 from all over the world. Some have died or have family members who have died from these pills. Others are permanantly in wheel chairs or confined to bed from the pain. The pain these pills can cause is not like anything else you have ever felt. It's new and extraordinarily tortuous. I have been suffering for almost two years because of ten Levaquin pills. I am only in my 30s and before Levaquin was in great health. The information in this book is worth reading, because the Fluoroquinolones are the most prescribed antibiotic out there, and chances are you will be handed a prescription for one. You need to know the truth about these pills before you even take just one. The first pill nearly ruptured my eyes! The third pill decayed my ankle. The list goes on forever, even long after I stopped the last pill, and you can never be entirely the same after you're affected 
 I found this a thoroughly enjoyable book. It is an easy read without being superficial. The writers focus mostly on American business--Morgan, Rockefeller, Ford and Gates--with emphasis on their money-making schemes & abilities. These are not "tell-all" biographical sketches. The writers never lose sight of their overall theme: money and power and how the two blend together. I would have liked more historical analysis (such is my bias). I found the chapter on Tulipmania fascinating (it is also the first time I have ever really understood Futures Trading). For anyone who finds economics and business an elusive mystery, this is an excellent starting point. (Also check out P.J. O'Rourke's Eat the Rich. 
 I picked this lovely book up on a whim while visiting the Harvard bookstore, and let it lie fallow for months.  It was not until I read Paul Hawken's "Ecology of Commerce," that this book demanded to be read.  I had no idea how well the two would go together.  Published in 2005, it is a balanced collection of essays written over the previous decade, and I found it to be better than any textbook or more labored treatise.   This book really worked for me.  Here are the highlights that made this book vital reading for any adult concerned about where we are going in the aftermath of the Bush-Cheney debacles.  Liberalism--root word liberty--has lost its moral voice.  It has no compelling vision just when public philosophy is most needed.  The author is quietly passionate about how values--enduring values--both enable localized self-governance and come from localized communities where everyone knows one another.  According to the author, individual knowledge of public affairs, and a sense of belonging to a larger commonwealth, are the underlying foundation for the Republic as our Founding Fathers bequeathed to us--"a Republic, if you can keep it," as Benjamin Franklin told us all.  This author is most powerful in making the case that "laissez faire" on values is to NOT have national values.  The author uses the early portion of the book to make the case that the larger question on anything is this: what strategy or policy will most support the nurturing of self-governance at the local and state levels?  This connects DIRECTLY to the current focus in Ecotopia (British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington State) on resilience and on the equivalent focus by the global public health intelligence network on the same word: resilience!  I was moved, almost to tears, to read this author quoting and discussing Thomas Jefferson and Justice Brandeis, who were both certain that concentrated power is threatening to liberty and self-governance.  Think Wall Street--Goldman Sachs, Carlyle, Wal-Mart, Exxon.  The rise of big government, led by Teddy Roosevelt, was intended to be an answer to big business, but it did not work.  Of course, carried to its logical conclusion, global business demands big government (that will not work).  The author tells us that we went astray in the 1960's.  We focused on economic growth and federal justice instead of the larger issue of what "political economy" would reinforce rather than diminish citizenship.  We focused on economic outputs rather than either the cost of inputs (see Herman Daly and Paul Hawken) or the goal of nurturing community.  This is really quite a brilliant thoughtful book.  In the middle section it explores the conflict between the concepts of rights of individuals versus the common good being imposed.  One has to ask (see George Will) should soulcraft be imposed or nurtured?  The book/author also drives a stake in the heart of globalization and corporations--it's about the economy, stupid, BUT not as Bill Clinton used it.  It's about decentralizing economic power, the collision between capitalism and community.  The author touches on impeachment (which is on the minds of many as citizens rally all over America today to demand that Congress impeach Bush-Cheney) and can not be more explicit: impeachment is warranted when  the President (or the Vice President in his name) undermines the system of government--the separation of powers.  [I would note, as an estranged moderate Republican, that we should at the same time impeach every Republican serving in Congress for abdicating their role as the FIRST branch of government (see Coburn).  From this book we are reinforced in our belief that corporate money is impacting on the political system in ways absolutely not anticipated by our Founding Fathers.  Money has supplanted reasoned dialogue.  The book closes with a marvelous review of Dewey as the greatest American philosopher, focusing on pragmatism as well as an openness to experimentation, a love of tolerance, and an avoidance of the absolute.  For Dewey, democracy was not about giving every individual what they wanted but rather about drawing the greatest good from the greatest number of diverse individuals.  In passing the author notes that the use of nuclear weapons, genocide (and one might add, ecocide) are global wrongs, for they destroy entire multi-generational cultures in all their history and diversity.  The author chooses to end with a salute to Rabbi David Hartman's interpretative pluralism (room for varied interpretations) and ethical pluralism (room for varied faiths).  The author and Hartman conceive of religion as a means of making sense of the world and of one another.  The last bit focuses on John Rawls, and the three debates he inspired: utilitarian versus rights; what rights? and should the government be neutral?  There is a breath-taking finish, describing how a judge approved Martin Luther King's march on public highways, despite George Wallace's objections, because the enormity of the wrongs being protested warranted such a significant granting of privilege.  I am in awe of this author, of this book, and of the Republic for which it stands. 
 I truly enjoyed reading this book.  Very well-written.  Everyone in my book club liked it and it made for good discussion.  Good for Catholics and non-Catholics 
 Doug Montgomery is an engineer with great statistical training. This enabled him to be a great teacher for statistical practitioners and an author of several excellent applied books in the design and analysis of experimental data and statistical process control. This book is one of the best sources for Design of Experiments for engineers, currently a very important topic in industry. He provides a wealth of information on classical designs and the analysis of variance models. In addition he provides a balanced perspective on the value of Taguchi designs. Other topics covered include response surface methods, evolutionary operation and mixture experiments 
 I enjoy reading Albert's books, but especially this series.  It is so much better written, I think, than the Victorian series.  Also, I want to grow and use herbs after I read her stories.  Apartment living curtails that considerably.  Her information is so good and so well written.  One always learns something new.  Her books are well worth the time

 Your ego and identity may well demand that you put this book down for good and denounce it as the smug ramblings of a limousine liberal with the luxury to indulge in all manner of fantasy.  Read on anyway.  If you pay attention to this book, you'll learn something powerful about yourself and the criticality of your role in creating your organization however you define that - whether it's self, family, business, government unit, or even society at large.    This book challenges everyone who reads it to accept that we and we alone are the authors of our own story of existence, experience, and meaning.  The message for leaders of organizations is that until now we've indulged our fear, created cultures of control and dependency and they are bankrupt.  The illusion of control never lasts long (look at any of your recent IT projects, for example) and dependency breeds discontent, waste, and backward momentum - all the things that give us more reasons to be fearful and to want to control.  The lessons in this book may well allow us to break that cycle, but only if we develop the courage first and foremost to be accountable for who we are.  One first step might be to ignore the voice of your ego insisting that you stop reading this silly book, and to read on with renewed attention. 
 Libba Bray's voice in this novel was an addicting one. A Great and Terrible Beauty is wonderfully interesting the whole book through, and the beautiful choice of words is what made the novel a page-turner. Bray really kept my interest, and when I finished, I picked it up and read it again. The characters are fascinating, and the plot, though hard to believe, is an entertaining one. A Great and Terrible Beauty is a magical novel that will leave you wanting more 
 Simply entertaining 50s British comedy. All in a value for money package. Should be in every DVD collection 
 It has taken me several months, but I have finally finished reading Who Will Tell The People by William Greider. It wasn't an easy book to read, it deals with government policy, protocol, politics, economics, and history. However, it was a fascinating book, therefore I stayed with it as I read several other books in between its completion. I have been a fan of Greider's since I started reading his articles about politics and the economy in the pages of Rolling Stone.   It is amazing how accurate Greider's description of the failings of democracy is today, 12 years after the book had been published (1992)-not much has changed, especially during the build up to the November 2004 elections. Most of his examples come from the Carter-Regan-Bush administrations or before. But he does an amazing job of showing how the power of the people has been transferred over the years into the hands of the rich and powerful. However, he does provide examples of how these powerful forces have been overcome by grass roots movements, and he seems hopeful that someday the true spirit of democracy will be seen in government.  One of his biggest concerns is how government fails in its greatest role upholding laws:  "Corrective mechanisms that are supposed to prevent political manipulations have been purposely weakened. And public inherits a grave injustice: a government that will not faithfully perform its most basic function-enforcing laws." (107)  Corporations will often accept fines rather than changes business practices that are in opposition to laws passed by the government for the good of the people. How long did it take to get air bags installed as a matter of course in cars?  He goes on to look at the unseemly practice of government officials going from public office to corporations:  "The federal government as a whole ahs been reduced to a training camp for private enterprise-a school in which the students learn the skills and insider knowledge that will be most valuable to outside employers. Under those circumstances only the most dedicated civil servants-or the most incompetent-are willing to remain in the public's hire." (116)    I know every administration is guilty of this, but it seems more visible in this one with Condi Rice coming from Exxon and Dick Cheney from Halliburton. The first MBA president, who has run every company that he has led into the ground save the Texas Rangers, scares me-business leaders are beholden to their stockholders-everyone else has to fend for themselves, this model works well when you think of shareholders as the people who gave money to his campaign,   The Democrats are just as guilty of this as the Republicans as Greider discusses in his chapter "Who Owns The Democrats?" And it's the same sort of big business types who fund Democrat candidates. The move to the center economically happened long before Clinton. This in turn leads to the kind of corporate welfare documented here:  "As it turned out, General Electric was possibly the biggest single winner in Ronald Regan's celebrated tax cuts. It had corporate profits of $6.5 billion during 1981-1983 and, astonishingly, received a tax rebate of $283 million form the federal government. Its tax burden went from $330 million a year to minus $900 million a year-money the government now owed GE. By rough estimate, the 1981 tax legislation yielded as much as $1.3 billion for General Electric over several years and probably much more in the long run." (341-342)  In the chapter "The Closet Dictator" he discusses the dangers of globalism, a chapter I'll guess that led him to write his book on globalism, One World Ready Or Not. All in all, it was a very thought-provoking book. Actually, it riles me up, because there's so little we can do about it. I guess democracy is a sort of utopian goal that we have to constantly strive for.  
 Aldous Huxley was one of the deepest and most profound thinkers to ever explore how various chemicals alter the state of one's thinking and being. His varying perceptions and thought processes are recorded in these two novellas with lucid clarity and thought that only Huxley could produce despite his mind-altering states. A fearless explorer and detractor of controlled societal construction, Huxley reveals with poignant depth the frequency and wavelengths of his various psychedelic induced experiences. A must read for those interested in chemical or meditatively induced mind expansion 
 At first, I thought that Smith was mining the same ground as Andrea Levy's SMALL ISLAND: examining the lives of immigrants in postwar London and tracing the routes that had brought them there. But while Smith does not quite have Levy's intensity, she spreads her net wider, dealing with several different cultures (Bengali, Jamaican, Jewish intellectual, and British working-class) over a span of three generations, only the first of which coincides with Levy's. Eventually it becomes clear that her main focus is on the youngest generation (presumably her own), and she chronicles the troubled nineties with sharp observation, vivid and often colloquially profane language, and considerable humor. I felt that the narrative lost coherence and the plotting became less plausible as the number of characters increased, though it may just be that I had less time to read. But Smith's central theme --- the difficulty of maintaining cultural identity in a strange land --- is extremely well addressed and chillingly relevant 
 Had no idea so many mistakes aren't caught in the editing process. I guess if the mistakes weren't there we wouldn't have this incredibly funny, extremely detailed and informative book. Loved the way the authors had their own pictoral anecdotes in the margins. Very clever 
 ...swipe from the best, and Heinlein certainly did here, lifting his plot from Anthony Hope (hodgeson)'s classic swashbuckler "The Prisoner of Zenda".  The interesting things about this book (which is NOT one of RAH's juveniles) that at first appear to set it apart from the majority of Heinlein's output are all characteristics of the narrator, Lorenzo.  Lorenzo is a xenophobe, an unheard-of trait for a Heinlein protagonist.  Lorenzo is completely incompetent at mathematics -- while RAH (through the mouthpiece of Lazarus Long) has opined that no-one is truly human who cannot understand higher mathematics.  Lorenzo is completely uninterested in politics or anything having to do with government, except as he personally may find himself interacting with law enforcement officials.  Lorenzo presents himself as something of a coward.  And Lorenzo is a raving egomaniac.  But Lorenzo learns to deal with his fear of Martians.  He never does learn math, but we gradually come to recognise that Heinlein has pulled a switch on us, and that Lorenzo is still our old friend, Heinlein's Competent Man -- but that his competency lies in another direction.  Because Lorenzo is recruited for the greatest challenge of an actor's career -- to impersonate, literally in front of entire worlds, an immensely famous politician, who has been kidnapped by his political enemies in order to derail an important treaty with  the inahbitants of Mars.  And, gradually, as Lorenzo comes to know the man he must replace -- know him from the inside out, and "become" him, to the point that he can extemporise politically sound speeches in the Great Man's style -- that he begins to understand that politics is all-important in making it possible for the masses to live in peace and security, Lorenzo Grows Up.  The Lorenzo we meet on Page One is a cheerful, flippant, shallow and actually fairly immature man.  The Lorenzo we see by the end of the story proper has matured, seen some of the wrongs that need righting, and has realised that someone has to step up to the line and take a stand or the wrongs will simply continue; that all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.  And that is what the story is about, really -- like RAH's juvenile, "Starman Jones", this is mostly a story about a man growing up and accepting a man's role and responsibilities.  And, as the much-older Lorenzo adds as a short coda at the very end of the book, learning the important thing about the faceless masses, the thing that so many politicians lose sight of -- that they have lives of their own.  That they can hurt.  (At least one previous review has alluded to the excerpts from Bonforte's speeches -- i strongly suspect that, as the character of Bonforte himself seems to be by the man, they are heavily influenced or inspired by the oratory of Winston Churchill.  Particularly, when i read the passage about choosing sides, i hear Winnie's voice in my head... 
 This is a must for any motorcycle rider either beginner or an advanced rider. Great for beginners to understand the principles of riding, great for advanced rider just to remind the basic rules and principles 
 Kreyling has written an excellent study of Macdonald, the author, and of Ken Millar, the man

 It may come as a shock, but I always suspected that something's not quite right with Snape. Well, we'll see what happens next.. 
 My six year old could not get enough of this book when he was ages 1-4yrs.  He loved it.  I have since bought it as a gift for many people and the children always love it.  Great book for fun with your toddler 
 The "Back to the Future" trilogy was excellent.  The item was in perfect condition and arrived quickly.  My husband, who owns a DeLorean, was happy to get the whole story and we have enjoyed watching the old movies.  
 This is a wonderful feel-good book for women! It will help you understand and appreciate God's love for you 
 Few social climbers are as surreally despicable as Edith Wharton's Undine Spragg, who doesn't care what happens to anyone else as long as she can shop and party. And "The Custom of the Country" is the perfect example of what such people do to the people around them. It's nauseating and brilliant, all at once.  Undine Spragg is a mesmerizing beauty from a tiny town, whose parents made a small-scale fortune and have moved to the glitzy world of New York. Undine wants the best of everything, more than her family can afford, but she thinks it's all worth it -- so she marries a besotted son of "old New York," but it doesn't take long for him to realize how incompatible they are.  And he doesn't realize that Undine is hiding a (then) shameful secret -- she was once married and quickly divorced from a vulgar businessman. In the present, Undine continues her quest for a life of pleasure, moving on to a French nobleman and getting just as dissatisfied with him. The only way to succeed lies in the one man who sees her for what she is.  Undine Spragg may actually be one of the most despicable, selfish characters in all of classic literature -- she literally doesn't care about anyone but herself, or who she hurts. You'd think a book about someone like that would be dreary, but instead it's one long needle at the people like Undine, who care only for money, status and fun.  But it's also about the changing fortunes in late 19th-century America (and Europe). New money -- symbolized by Undine and her shrewd, megarich ex-hubby -- was squeezing out the old guard, who were never terribly rich to start with. Wharton's observations on their rise and decline have a sharp, biting edge. Although compared to the anti-heroine, the old traditions seem pretty innocent.  Lots of celebrity socialites could take a lesson from Undine's story: she's a snob of humble stock, thinks she's a great person, and utterly selfish -- if her husband shoots himself, that's great! She can marry again without the disgrace of a divorce! Yet in the end, you know that Undine will always be craving something more that she thinks will make her happy, but she will never find it.  The characters around Undine are usually nice, but blinded by her nymphlike beauty -- and even her parents, who know what she's like, are too beaten-down by her whining to resist. Only her ex-husband, Ralph Marvell, is really right for her -- not only is he obscenely rich and just as grasping as Undine, but he's smart enough to know what a monster she is.  "The Custom of the Country" is a wickedly barbed, brilliant piece of work, with one of the nastiest anti-heroines ever, and a great look at the rising tides of "new money." A must-read 
 This is one of the best technical/theoretical books I have ever read. It sets the example for teaching the fundamentals of communication theory to a capable audience without diluting the content. Yes it is old, but OLD is GOLD in this case.   This book (combined with Van Trees' "Detection, Estimation, and Modulation Theory, vol.1) is an excellent manuscript for a fundamental understanding of communication theory.   (1) Especially valuable is the chapter 4 (about optimum receiver principles), that makes this book a great buy. For the more enthusiastic student,   (2) Chapter 5 gives the derivation of the Shannon Capacity Theorem, a concept that makes one proud to understand.   (3) Chapters 2 & 3 provide very strong background on probability and random processes. You may have had these on your other courses, but this is a very nice treatment and referred by the later chapters.   (4) Chapter 6,7,8 are about implementation, channel models, and waveform communications, and they are obviously outdated, (e.g., Viterbi algorithm was not invented yet when this book was written) . However, if you feel the need to implement a Fano decoder, this is the best place to look, explanations by other books appear to be wrong!  RECOMMENDATION: *************** This is one of the most valuable books for me in my personal library. Definitely buy it, you will not regret it.  This book sets the standard so high that other contemporary books on communication theory in general (examples: Proakis, Sklar) look like second rate, and rush job, copy and paste books on certain specialties such as space-time coding, MIMO (example: Paulraj et. al.) recyclable paper quality.   LONG LIVE: Wozencraft and Jacobs 
 Review no.98.Total of fourteen tracks,'Yeah!' simply has to be ONE of the best all-cover CD's I've ever heard.I've just recently caught Leppard on their current summer co-headlining tour with Journey,as they superbly played two of the best cuts off this CD,T.Rex's "20th Century Boy" and David Essex's Rock On" (I've heard fans go nuts over hearing this tune,saying it's the best song to hit the airwaves in years). Other outstanding tracks here are Badfinger's "No Matter What", The Face's FM staple "Stay With Me",Free's "Little Bit Of Love" and ELO's "10538 Overture".A must-have.Highly recommended 
 We read this book every night before bedtime as well as "When Momma Comes Home from Work Dear Child".  I highly recommend both books for every working mother 
 This was a wonderful movie about a group of very good friends.  The acting is realistic for the movies sake.  It will definately pull at your heartstrings.  Also full of the comapassion one hopes for in their end days/years.  I was a caregiver so this was an important view.  Highly recommended!!!! 
 I am a hairstylist and bought this as a little extra bonus to my services. I use it on my clients after I am done and before styling their hair. They love it! Most say they want to just fall asleep right there in the chair and it keeps them coming back. Some of my clients have even said that they came in with a headache but after I used it the headache was gone. My coworkers love it too and I use it on them as well. Now all my coworkers want one to use on themselves as well as their clients. This is an amazing product and I love it 
 This is one of the best accounts of the Holocaust that I have read.  It is  completely objective, just leading the reader through the facts.  Instead  of taking the stance of "Hitler is evil and to blame for it all,"  the book shows the reader who all the players were, and how they were  created.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants the facts 
 The recording quality may not be absolutely perfect but the item captures Bukowski as he was, and adds significantly to the image one gets about his personality and his views from reading his, frequently repetitive books 
 One of the best, and incredibly influential.  What we know today about Kennedy was not probably available to White, and nobody would have dared to put it in print at the time anyway.  White's books on the '64, '68, and '72 campaigns are just as good, and though long out of print are readily available and cheap at any used book store.  Classic stuff 
 I think its fair to compare Arise to maybe Beneath the Remains or the awesome Chaos AD, but unfair to compare it too other thrash albums.  This stuff destroys and lays to ruins all heavy metal acts on the planet.  That said, when I reach in my CD case for a sick thrash CD - I usually grab this one before Chaos or BTR.  This one is just retarded from beginning to end.  If you are reading this review.. run out jump in the car the drive 100 mph to the nearest record shop and PRAY they have it in stock.  Absolutely mind boggling stuff 
 I recently came across the title as cited by several different people as a book that was important in their life, and I'm grateful that I did. It encompasses all of the ideas expressed in many other books of its type, however it doesn't leave anything out, while addressing each topic in a succinct way. It is not new, and a few of the examples given will be dated. That doesn't lessen it's messages in anyway. 
 I bought the variety pack and tried this flavor fourth. I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland. So I ordered these and I love this flavor. In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her. They use black pepper which is flavorful, but I wouldn't call it spicy 
 The Brethren, by Beverley Lewis, is an endearing novel about life on the Pennsylvania countryside. It grants us a portal into a world understood by few: the world of the Amish, of the Brethren. Its tale tells of unrequited love, regret, daring boldness to buck against the established order and think in new ways, and a simple belief in God most "Englischers" find odd, perhaps even backward.  Annie Zook - daughter of an Amish preacher - is paying a heavy price for her indulgences.  She's acted questionably in the eyes of the People; engaging in such indulgent activities as painting for the sake of painting, (even having the audacity to sell one to a magazine), and spending undue time with an Englisher, skirting on the edges of love.    She's not shunned - not yet - but she traipses along the edges by leaving home to live with one of their shunned people, Esther - who's been cast out for leaving the People's church for one preaching of Christ's saving grace.  Annie wishes to return home, but try as she might; she can't take her mind off painting, or even worse - an Englisher named Ben Martin.  Meanwhile, Ben struggles to re-adjust to life back home, away from Annie and the Amish. Driven by a strange wanderlust, he's about to sign up with the Peace Corps to travel far from home when his family unveils a startling secret: he's adopted, not their biological son.  Shocked, Ben now understands why he never seemed to fit in, always driven to move from one place to another. He wonders about the urge to return to Annie, so he embarks on a journey to discover who he is, and where he's from. What he discovers challenges everything he knows about himself, and everything the People think they know about their town.  The Brethren is an easy-going story that would make a good fit for the Lifetime channel. Lewis paints a realistic portrayal of the Amish, and the novel is enlightening as well: I can confess my own ignorance of their ways, not knowing many sects didn't believe in Christ's saving grace.  In any case, the characters are for the most part believable; the countryside images vivid.   However, The Brethren does have a few problems. I was thrown off by the dialogue every now and then; at points Lewis emulates accurate Amish dialect: "Ach, I was ever so worried" - but then the same character would speak in a very contemporary manner only lines later: "You're joking!". It made me think of Kevin Costner's much-maligned Brooklyn accent in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.   Also, Louisa's character - a friend of Annie who apparently inspired her to paint in a previous book - felt "tacked" on, mostly for the sole purpose of convincing her unsaved friend not to have an abortion near the end of the novel.  She was an interesting character, her angst over choosing between Sam - who's going to leave the People to become "fancy" - and Michael, her former fiancï¿½, was somewhat compelling, but she didn't seem to add anything to the story.  In the end, The Brethren was interesting, but the plot wore down at the end.  A twist comes far too early in the story, and the narrative seems to drift along after that. However, if you're interested in the life of the Amish, perhaps The Brethren is the book for you 
 I just discovered this book, and it is a godsend!  I have my entire company reading it.  We can tell that there is a profound difference in the way that our customers respond to us.  Janelle Barlow is a very gifted  researcher with the ability to make complex ideas clearly understandable.   Her co-author, Claus Moller, is one of Europe most highly regarded  management gurus.  The book even comes with a forward by the Chairman of  British Airways -- who credits the methods discussed with turning his  complany around from a money-loser to one of the world's premier airlines.   I recommend this book to everyone who wants to get better at customer  service 
 After the Adventures in the Screen Trade many years ago, I had to sink my eyes in this second adventure.  I must admit to being a Goldman fan.  It was a hard volume to put down.  I went from cover to cover in a couple of days.  Back again a few more times.  I laughed so many times I felt dizzy.  Kinda got a buzz!  Good reads are supposed to do that to you!  Goldman's read is cool!  It's heavy with experience!  He's crossed a lot of bridges, built some, and burned some too!  This one is a Do Not Miss read too.  As usual, no butt kissing here!  He tells it like it is, not how it should be!  An E-ride ticket to how things are in Dreamland.  Hey, Goldman!  We're waiting for the next Adventure 
 If you're curious about what Kauai is like and what there is to do there, Kauai Trailblazer is your guide. Practical info is as good as you can get and their style is lively and positive.  We counted on it day by day to get us to the highs. The locals even gave it the two thumbs up. We stayed in the plantation cottages they recommended and never looked back. Our getaway turned out to be not that expensive. We're going back for more at Christmas 
 It only took me 10 pages of reading this book to realize that my top notch public school education, was well, not so top notch.  Sure, I know how to read, write and occasionally even have been known to do some math.  But in comparison to my parents' generation, I have no point of reference when it comes to carrying on an intelligent conversation.   Today's youth learns a fraction of the information that was once considered essential for every day life.  How can somebody intelligently participate in a debate on enviromental issues, when they barely have a slight understanding of science and the arguments being made?  At times this book seems like a student text book, as Hirsch lists words and ideas that should be learned in order to be cultural literate.  He even goes as far as printing a 60 page appendix with words and phrases that we, as cultural literate Americans, should know.  An argument could be made however, that American's aren't becoming culturally illiterate.  But instead, society's definition of cultural literacy is changing.  In 1950 terms such as the world wide web, the internet, web portal, email, and hyperlink were not terms you would hear used.  And you certainly wouldn't be considered culturally illiterate during that time period if you had never heard or used them.  But fast forward to 2005 and suddently those are key terms that every literate person knows.  It is a sign of how with the help of technology and innovation, our culture changes.  Hirsch is correct in my opinion that today's youth is less informed than prior generations on things that were once considered basic knowledge.  However, I do not see it as the down fall of our nation like he does.  In the end, this nation will survive even if we all do not know about Pike's Peak or The Red Badge of Courage.  In closing, read this book if you aren't afraid of learning something even though the subject matter might seem dry at times.  Everybody that reads this book will learn something.  EVERYBODY.  Even if you do not agree with Hirsch's arguments, this book will prove to be insightful.  
 Ken Davies has written an informed observer's account of the passionate race to solve what some believe to be the most profound scientific riddle of our era: decoding the human genome. His book is an undertaking of ambitious scope: He aims to paint the personalities in all their human colors and offer an accurate historical account, while also drilling deep enough into the research to do justice to the science. He does a beautiful job of suggesting the profound personal motivations of the two protagonists of the drama, scientists Francis Crick and maverick scientist J. Craig Venter. Short of earning your Ph.D. in molecular science, this may be as close as you ever get to understanding what the hoopla was really all about. We [...] recommend Davies' book as a must for savvy thinkers in the biotech business, and an enlightening read for the rest of us mere (genetically flawed) mortals 
 This was the season when the A-Team was the highest rated television. This comedic series had an eclectic group of actors with George Peppard, Mr. T, Dwight Shultz, and Dirk Benedict who with their everyman type of fighting and propensity to create tanks out of gardening supplies provided a fun hour of television.  This season had a few turkey episodes but overall it was entertaining with several excellent episodes, some of which were penned by the excellent writing talents of Stephen J. Cannell. The Big Squeeze, and Incident at Crystal Late stood out as some of the best the episode in the series and even the ones that were a little clich such as Bullets and Bikinis, and Timber you got the idea the actors where having a little fun.  This season was before the Cosby show made them make some serious changes in order to try to stay alive, and the formula was in full force.  So if you like to watch elaborate con jobs or even the worst (or best shots) in the cinema pick up this season 
 I've had this photo printer a few weeks now.  I don't consider myself technically proficient.  I totally scored despite gross ignorance with this machine.  You cannot go wrong.  The photo quality is astonishing.  I've printed professional quality photos and framed them.  The results are fantastic.  For someone who is techno-challenged, I had this up and running very quickly 
 While visiting Hawaii on vacation, I took a gamble on the hip tiki-style cover and soon realized that I had found a gem among the fodder. These sultry and exotic beats will transport you to that tiki-torched lounge by  the lagoon, while sipping your Mai-Tai. This is it 
 This book was a great source of information on the Juvenile Justice System, especially the system in Los Angeles.  A compelling read, the grim realities of juvenile justice are conveyed with an unusual blend of compassion and pragmatism.  A must-read for anyone interested in learning more about this important subject 
 It's Pirates....It's Captain Ahab...It's Las Vegas, I ask all of you out there, what's not to love?!  Fans of the first book 'Pirates: In An Adventure With Scientists' will be well rewarded by this sequel.  Mr. Defoe maintains his sense of fun when our favorite band of scurvy curs hooks up with Captain Ahab in his search for the great white whale.  I particularly loved the comparative terminology list between pirates & cowboys..that alone is worth the price of the book.    If you want a serious, dramatic work of literary fiction then get yerself a book by Dickens.  If you want a fun, fast, rolickingly funny tale of piratical daring-do & the pitfalls of ship-shopping then 'Pirates: In An Adventure With Ahab is for you.  I look forward to 'Pirates: In An Adventure With Rabbits' myself.    
 This book offers an excellent overview of History. I highly recommend using this in preparation for the American History I CLEP exam. In addition to this text, I used Baron's EZ-101 Study Keys, "American History to 1877." I read them simultaneously to get a broader perspective of each era of history, then wrote out key events and people on index cards for review. I also did a lot of the AP US HIstory quizzes on the historyteacher.net website. Combined...after studying for a little more than a week, I acheived a 69 out of 80 on the CLEP test 
 Classic Peter Sellers. If you are a fan, this movie belongs in your collection 
   This movie is really good. It begins when Moltres is captured by an evil madman and the world of pokemon is disturbed. Acording to Professor Oak, the pokemon can sense natural or in this case, "manmade" disasters. Ash and friends' boat gets stranded on an island where they are greeted by creepy natives-or so they think.   Turns out they are wearing masks. Ash is also the "chosen one" for the ceromony and they discover that the mission is true. Ash sets out to "save the world" from whatever is ailing it, and he doesn't even know what. Ash and friends are lucky enough to witness the madman capture Zapdos next using electirc caging technology.    On accident madman also takes Ash and the gang. There they escape from the cage he has trapped them in and free the two birds just before he captures Articuno as well.  The three birds then begin fighting, and Lugia the legendary pokemon rises to peace it out.    For people who don't like pokemon, you sure are missing out on a good thing!  
 An absolutely wonderful product!  I was given one as a gift and can't do without it on my regular business & holiday flights.  It stores very neatly and attaches conveniently to your flight case.  Congratulations on a truly brilliant product - EVERYONE WHO TRAVELS SHOULD HAVE ONE!  No more itchy, small airline blankets for me!  Buy one for your husband, wife, sister, brother, mother, father, friend - anyone who travels frequently.  A STAR PRODUCT **** 
 I am using the babyplus system for the second time and  am looking forward to the same benefits as it produced with my 5 year old. Faith was born alert, calm, and hardly cried at all as an infant. She slept through the night right away with only waking to eat. She is now in her last year of preschool and she enjoys to write, sing and listen to music and loves arts and crafts. Her teachers tell us how she is constantly helping other students in class with writing letters and words when they have had trouble. Her disposition has always been happy and eager to learn. She has great coordination  with activities and sports. I am a nurse and I tell all my patients and friends about the BabyPlus system. I am pregnant with my second child and there was no question at all that I would use the BabyPlus system again. Do not be afraid to try something new. Just read the studies and reviews, they speak for themselves. You will not be sorry that you purchased this product for your unborn child. 
 This book isn't written in the entertaining journalistic fashion one might expect from an author such as Jim Marrs, but the information provided is useful. There are congressional documents on the MK-Ultra research with emphasis on human testing. For more in depth information, Bluebird by Dr. Colin A. Ross is recommended 
 Want to make more money? Want to learn how to REALLY sell on the phone? This is the book! I have purchased and read many books on teleselling but this one is the best. Specfic strategies that work! Highly Recommended!! 
 I believe many physics students will agree that QFT is the most difficult among the main branches of 20th century theoretical physics (putting string theory apart), and books on the subject are notoriously difficult reads.  Zee's book is a largely successful attempt to reverse this judgement. It presents the subject in an accessible form by simplifying the presentation, avoiding too difficult calculations and math, and insisting on the physical meaning of the theory. It seems Zee has spent considerable efforts in presenting the calculations and logical derivations as simply as possible. It is a pleasure to read the nice and lively explanations on renormalization or the subtleties of gauge theories. Thanks to this book, I could jump into QFT again many years after having studied it in the university, without too much pain. However, this simplification has a drawback: the presentation sometimes lacks precision and can therefore become quite confusing if the reader has no previous knowledge of the main concepts. A couple of pages are really obscure. Nevertheless, these defects seem to me of less importance than the pedagogic qualities of the text, justifying the 5 stars of my evaluation. I would recommand this book, not as teaching material, but as compulsory reading in complement to a standard course on QFT 
 Once again Robert Crais writes a entertaining action filled book. This book is the first one that I know of with the main character is Joe Pike. Great to get to know this wonderfully written character on a more personal level 
 I read this book in an afternoon - about 4 hours.  I literally could not stop turning the pages.  This was an absolutely RIVETING chapter in Stone Barrington's life; suspenseful, horrifying and at the same time it sets up a lot of the ground floor for his future as well (the house in CT, his car, etc.).  My ONLY complaint (and BOY is it a doozy) is that for some strange reason between the end of the last book (Swimming to Catalina) and the beginning of this book, Stuart Woods apparently got a bug up his butt and decided to change the gender of Vance and Arrington's child for some reason - at the end of the previous book, Arrington called Stone and said she had just had a baby girl, and suddenly in this book, they have a boy.  It annoys me when a writer changes continuity like that for no reason.    At any rate, when the book opens, Stone is pining for Arrington and Dino is trying to cheer him up by taking him to a party, where he meets a lovely young woman, who takes him to her place - and they order Chinese food.  Unfortunately, the Chinese place cannot deliver, so he must go pick up the food.  When he returns, he finds her dead, her throat slit wide open.  Things spiral down from there as people first he knows, then Dino knows, are murdered or attacked.  Stone and Dino find themselves racing against the clock to try to figure out who is behind this before the next killing - or before Stone himself is fingered for the first murder.  Although the killer (for most of the murders) becomes quite obvious about half-way through the book, it still remains taut as they try to catch him and still remain out of his reach, and there still remains the matter of the first murder and who did that.  This is a pleasing work from a great writer.  I look forward to the next installment - LA Dead 
 Mr. Sturges second book, by now he'd fully developed the style his fans all know so well. Some of his best nudes, and clothed portraits, are featured here. This is one of the better photo books I've got, maybe one of Sturges better books. The most notable feature are perhaps the two contributed essays, the one at the front of the book quotes unidentified subjects of Mr. Sturges on their feelings about posing for him, you won't find anything else like that until the most recent book "Notes" 
 This book is just the beginning of a series full of good-character and fun-filled adventures. It will keep you interested the whole way through. With tales of every good or bad event that Jim encounters on his many early morning rounds to aid the animals of his English countryside, this book is a celebration to life. James Herriot makes the books come alive with his expertise in writing. A great book 
 I feel sorry for those reviewers here that can't or won't enjoy this book. What a great way to pass a few hours time. Sure it was full of expletives, but that is the way a few of these characters would think and talk. It was a great take on the seedier side of life and wasn't meant to be anything but funny. I've read the book twice and own the DVD, which really isn't that bad, unless you compare it to the book, which is unfair about most movies adapted from good books. The movie had the misfortune of having its original release date scheduled for shortly after 9/11, and that certainly would not have worked with a plane highjacking at the end, but I digress. So I'll digress further, I recently listened to Dave Barry give an excellent performance of this book on cassette, and it stood up well there, too. If you're not an absolute prude, read this book and enjoy the romp. It's funny. End of story 
 This is a good book, but not what I expected.  It's about a specific time in birding and America.  This makes Kenn Kaufman's experience unique.  This was during the "early days" of birding and bird listers.  There was not the instantaneous information of the location of rare species we have now.  If you are interested in birding, the search for rare bird species, or the effort to see bird species out of their normal range, I would recommend this book 
 This was a great purchase. The CD kept me entertained for a long time. It's even better to watch his facial expressions on the DVD, although the DVD is pretty short. I definitely recommend this purchase. This guy is HILARIOUS! 
 Wow!!GNR were terrific. Civil War is their best song they created in history!!! Paradise city is a bad song though. Listen to most of the songs,this is good. 
 You have to have read a couple of Dick Francis' novels before you understand the author. In a way he stands alone, for as far as I can tell he has not overtly used other writers styles and no contemporary writer has used Francis as a primary influence. All of Francis' books follow a similar arc, from one to the next, you know exactly what you will get. But in a strange way, this is not bothersome, instead it is like revisiting an old familiar and comfortable place.   Francis' books are not in a series format. He only uses the same character for a second time once. In his first ten or so books, he uses a particular jockey to set his story around. And later he finds people of different professions that have racing interests to center stories around. This book, "For Kicks" is from the transitional phase, the late 60's, early 70's. It tells the story of Daniel Roke, a trainer from Australia who is hired to uncover a doping ring that is not being detected through traditional meathods. Its a pretty simple story, and like all of Francis' work it is refreshingly understated. With James Patterson and Patricia Cornwells mamoth body counts and terrorising serial killers, or end of the world scenarios ala Tom Clancy and too many others influencing todays reading lists, its amazing to see how much quiet tension builds up in Francis' stories.   I would highly recommend Francis to anyone. Its a fun world to live in for a while, where all of England revolves around the racing world... every other profesion comes second. I remember how much I loathed the idea of Francis before I first read him and I laugh now at my perception of what his books would be about. I mean, how can one author base a huge series of mysteries on racing horses? Dick Francis does so quite well 
   Not only was this an extremely enjoyable book to read but it was also very informative.  The characters are well developed and Weir presents the material in a straight forward and  organized manner.  The cast of characters is large and the plots sometimes complicated and always intriging.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the world today and it's history.  Obviously, one has very much to do with the other 
 Today, any advocate of womankind operates under the shadow of feminism. Some react against it, some seek to extend and refine it, and some seek to preserve it. Either way, they must respond to some claims, going back to Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, and other early feminists, such as: -many of the behavioral differences between men and women are socially constructed, not biological -the path to sexual justice lies in the diminution of gender roles (i.e. "seperate spheres") in favor of free choice -most fundamentally, men and women are of equal moral worth.  Moderata Fonte existed before the feminist movement as we know it. As a result, she did not think in the same terms as we would about sexual justice. For example, she never challenges the idea that differences between men and women are intrinsic, as far as I can tell. Similarly, she does not attack gender roles: rather, she asserts that the woman's proper gender role as homemaker, mother, and teacher is undervalued by patriarchal society, and the man's gender role as conqueror and ruler is overvalued. She does not claim men and women are moral equals: she claims women are superior.  The book is written as a three way dialogue. Sometimes, the conversation drifts (realistically) to other topics, unrelated to Fonte's main point. This may be frustrating to readers expecting concision, but the diversions can also be interesting, offering insights into the culture of the time 
 ...one bad thing:  After you listen to these outrageously raw beats from the streets of Brazil,  "Arular" by M.I.A. will not sound as original as it did before.  But, oh well, every one has their influences.  This "Baile funk" stuff is awesome.  Or "Rio Funk", either way, I beleive the word "favela" describes the parties where this type of music is played in Brazil.    By the way,...how in the world could a reviewer think all these songs sound the same?  This stuff is all over the place.  Every minute you're engaged and dancin it up in your car as the dj mixes up an entire UNIVERSE of beats.  OKAY, I do confess, its a bit noisy and crazy.  But its street music.  I think it adds to the charm.  The sound is similar to taking one step forward, and then two steps back... you wind up in a different place than you had expected.  Though you can here that technology is lacking, it makes this mix all the more charming.  The upbeat feel to this album is a spicey treat, and the Do-It-Yourself feel of old school electro is definitely present.  There's Afrika Bambaata in the background in one track for sure.    This is street music, raw and real.  Its got a DIY feel to it, but that is a good thing.  Feels like you're there while djs are mixing it up all dirty in order to keep the place moving.  Plenty of vocals (in Portegeuse?) thrown in to the layers of booty shaking rhythms keeps the feel ROWDY.  And I mean rowdy... the MCs are screaming things in some other language.  But after listening to all that Reggaeton on the radio, I like it.  Mind you, this isn't normal "electronica".  Its definitely "urban" music.  And sounds a bit 80s/90s.  But, as I said before, its all part of its charm.  If you have heard of Diplo (who was on tour with M.I.A. when she first blew up), his Florida album features a track that is pure "Baile Funk"/"Rio Funk"/"Favela Beats":  Diplo Rhythm feat. Sandra Melody, Vybz Cartel & Pantera Os Danadinho.  Its an awesome track.  Now I know where his influences are... RIGHT HERE 
 The genius in Naipaul is that he can make anyone care about poor people growing up in the undeniable backwaters of an island in the Caribbean.  He does this without condescension, and with sarcasm, detachment, humor, and warmth, all at the same time.  I couldn't put this book down.  Naipaul is the standard for all good writing: staying sensitive to dialect but having perfect English grammar.  Especially for writers of color, he is the standard for having pride and interest in our histories without arrogance or being exclusionary, and seeing how wisdom and stupidity are transcendent through all peoples.  My all time favorite.  I would like to read it again, but the conundrum is I want to read his other stuff too.  Perhaps when I retire.... 
 There's no question that Siegfried Sassoons's is the finest of the World War I poetry. How the poems are presented to the reader is A PROBLEM. Publishers employ "lick and a polish" guys who excell at slight touch-ups to a graphic design that enables the corporation to double the book price. THIS BOOK."THE WAR POEMS OF SIEGFRIED SASSOON",COSTS TOO MUCH. If Sassoons poems were the value for the money, hooray. But we're not paying the money to Sassoon. Sassoon has been dead for half a century. Sassoon does not, therefore, benefit from the high cost of the publication. Poems: GREAT. book: OVER-PRICED 
 The Moon Handbook to Mexico City was sufficiently comprehensive for a five-day trip, including a side trip to Teotihuacan. It's nothing fancy: the writing is strictly utilitarian but what it lacks in flair it makes up for in scope. Navigating an urban center as large as Mexico City you need a book like this--it tells you what you need to know about nearly every area of interest to a tourist. When visiting a city of 20 million I'll gladly sacrifice flair for details, especially where safety and security are concerned. In this respect Moon delivered.  And while other reviewers may complain that the maps the book contains are inadequate, don't forget that Mexico City is, by any number of different metrics, one of the world's largest cities. Almost ANY map will be inadequate. And while the Moon Guide's maps could certainly have been more detailed, they are, like the written portion, solid and comprehensive. Bottom line: the Moon Handbook will get you through Mexico City, but the fun times and memories will be up to you 
 	The Lost Gospel is a fascinating report of how the long known but never read Gospel of Judas came back to life after eighteen centuries of condemnation. 	Gospel of Judas along with other text, James, the Letter of Peter to Philip and Book of Allogens were discovered written in Coptic on papyrus from a remote burial cave in Egypt.  Author Krosney followed with a detail account how this discovery of antiquity was transacted and transported in three continents and even locked up for almost two decades in a bank vault in New York.  It showed dealing among business people and academics.  He gave related background information so that readers would understand the conflicts and struggles between orthodox and Gnostics Christians.  The Gnostic Christians were attacked and suppressed as heretics and disappeared mysteriously.  Christianity grew as the orthodox dominated by affirming the Four Gospels with Judas as the traitor.  It was later developed into anti-Semitism and the horror of Holocaust. 	Gospel of Judas offered the other side of the story.  It was Jesus who requested Judas to fulfill his mission by handing him over to the Romans for crucifixion.  Gnostic text shed light to the diversity among different Christian sects in early times.  It is challenging to be Christians in ancient as well as modern on theology and doctrine. 	This book gives readers a good understanding of the ancient world, specially Gnostic Christians.  Readers would enjoy the details of movement after the discovery.  However, this book only gives a brief chapter on the Gospel of Judas. Readers may be encouraged to read the other book, Gospel of Judas for a more detail understanding of text and belief of the heretic sect known as Gnostic Christians. 
 This was definitely the right album for Jay-Z to go out on (even though I know he's coming out with another album soon). Jay-Z came out of the gates with a blast with Reasonable Doubt, which is undoubtedly one of the best hip-hop albums of all time. However, since then I was really not impressed with much of his work. Vol 1, 2, & 3 were all mediocre with good songs here and there. The Dynasty was complete garbage. Blueprint was a good album and I started regaining faith in J, even though he was dissin my man (at the time) Nas. Blueprint 2 would have been good if he'd taken all of the good songs off of both cd's and just made a 1 disc album. Then comes the Black Album, which seems to be a fitting end to a controversial but all in all great career. This album just brings back all that I loved about J on his first album. Raw talent rhyming combined with excellent soulful beats just makes for a great chilled listening. My favorite tracks include: Encore, Threat, Interlude, 99 Problems & December 4th. The whole album is great and if you're a real Jay-Z fan, I know you'll enjoy. It really shocked me that a lot of people didn't like this album - probably because it's not the mainstream bs that everybody has succumbed to. I would definitely recommend you buy this albu 
 I thought this book was one of the best books in the Chip Hilton Sports Series! I have read almost the entire series, and trust me, this one is GREAT comparing to a lot of the other super stories in the series 
 My opinion is based on the comparison with the orginal publication in German, which I purchased in 1960 to provide essential information for the subsequent psychiatric evaluations of several thousand Holocaust survivors 
 My boys, ages 5 and 7, love this!  My 5 year old has been using it constantly, often spending an hour at a time with it.  A much better choice than TV or video games when you don't have time to spend reading a real book to them 
 I'm surprised the other reviewer only gave this 3 stars. I think the photograghy is sumptuous and the text is quite lovely. These are the spots I remember and go back to in my imagination 
 I have been a fan of Robert A. Heinlein since I was 8 years old.  This book is from what many consider his most creative period.  The so-called juveniles he wrote for Charles Scribners Sons had an immediate and lasting impact.  None of them has ever been out of print.  This is despite their awful titles and their original target audience.  Maximilian Jones is from a poor family.  The star of the family was his late Uncle Chester who was a member of the Astrogator's Guild.  Max runs away from home with his Uncle's astrogation manuals with a vague notion of following in his Uncle's footsteps.  Along the way he meets with and is robbed by another tramp, Sam.  In a interesting twist of events, this thief becomes the best friend a man ever had.  Between the Max's brilliance and Sam's avarice and cunning,their mutual loyalty, and series of fortunate and unfortunate events, Max achieves his goal.  Obviously a novel written during the fifties has dated technology.  The ships computer is two steps above Eniac.  There are effectively no female crewmen.  But none this detracts from a fine story.  Along the way lessons are given, regarding leadership, friendship, responsibility and of all things rule of law.  Having read this as a child, I did not understand everything at the time that I read it.  But as I grew older the lessons learned helped me in life.  The book is still an excellent read even if you're an adult.  Personally I have gone so far as to track down an old library hardcover with the original illustrations 
 I loved this book.  It was educational and at the same time highly entertaining.  There are several themes going on in the same book.  First there is the actual review of restaurants and education of food and wine.  Second, there is the truth about restaurants, food, and service that is exposed.  Finally, there is the journey of the author and what she learns about herself, desires, and needs.  All three themes are woven seemlessly to make a highly fun book to read 
 From being friends, family members, and associates of several Greeks, there is much information in this book that I was already familiar with, but I still wanted to read it as a reference guide for my own publication.  And indeed, I'm so very glad that I did.  This book took an intelligent perspective on the pros and cons of being Greek.  The author discussed the history of stepping, a few interviews with nonBlacks who crossed, the heinous history of hazing, the complexity of the Board and advisers versus undergraduates in volunteer work and pledging, and a well-thought out idea on how hazing can stop, but the pledging process will still weed out the slackers and attention seekers.  The author spoke about the history, reputation, symbols, hand signals, and style of the Divine Nine (even when there were originally eight).  This book is indeed a great source to learn about the history of Black Greeks, and I applaud him for his hard work.  
  I was first introduced to Susan by a friend who weighed before I met her 350 pounds. When I started to gain weight I met my friend who was smaller than me. She would always telling me to watch what I ate. She one day showed me a picture of herself and she was really fat. She explained everything about the Susan Powter program and I now weighing 210 wanted to know more. So I went out and bought her book and tapes. Threw my scale away and never looked back. I began to walk 20 minutes a day. I begin to eat, eat and eat and I watched what I ate. NOw 125 I eat when I want and what I want. If I want steak I have steak. but I also eat my vegetables and fruits. And I love rice and bake potatoes.I have a six pack and two children, born after losing the weight. I don't see my friend that often but I am really happy to have met her. The most important thing I learned was that I had to know what I was putting in my mouth and how much. I had to move, walk, jump and run, I couldn't sit on the couch and expect to lose weight because I knew how much fat I was eating. Knowing wasn't enough. I had to burn off the fat already on my body. And it took me a little over eight months. It works. It really does 
 This book is an excellent account of General Patton's battles in WWII. In his own words he describes some moments of the campaigns in the European Thater of Operations including North Africa. But this book is not only account of the battles, but it also contains events telling us stories about Patton's personal experineces and showing us that a war is not just battles, but also many other things. 
 This is a happy, feel good CD. It puts you in a groovy mood and the slower tunes, makes you feel like swaying to the beat. My favorite song is 'Jellybeans and Chocolate'. It's an upbeat tune that makes my toe tap. So glad I bought this smooth jazz CD 
 As a graduating senior myself I can partially understand some of Cedric's struggles as a high school student.  Probably many others can also because we all went through it.  I, myself, have the priveldge of growing up in a afluent neighborhood and school district.  I can see how difficult it was for someone wanting to acheive so much and to not relate with his fellow students and join in on the culture they lived.  Though through his mothers gift of faith, and strength.  Cedric Jenning's manages to leave the hallowed halls of his high school to go onto something great.  Ultimately proving to us that to do something great it takes a great leap of faith in ourselves to achieve something above what could be expected of us, and to rise above the situation we where born into and change it.  Cedric talks about dreamkillders and how so many people are given a situation weather for the good or for the bad and they settle just for that.  While many can't see the opportunity that lies behind the hard work of changing the situation.  Even those with good situation don't try to make it better and to settle for what they have.  Thoreau said that, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."  This book is a good message for all of those who read old, and young.  Especially for those getting ready to enter a new step of there life, or are just planning to stay in the one they are now. 
 I have tried 2 different plastic bathtubs.  The first one was sturdy and spacious but it has a bump that was very uncomfortable around my baby's waistline.  The other one has a fabric sling on top of the plastic bathtub.  It provided good support but my baby felt wobbly. Both bathtubs prove to be unsatisfactory. I use this bath form in my shower cubicle (on the floor) with a long flexible shower head.  My baby does not fuss in it as she feels secured.  It dries very quickly. Great product with a reasonable price.  
 Peter pan is a great book.It's about a boy that doesn't want to grow up.There is a little girl named Wendy and she has two littler brothers named John and Michle.The setting takes place in Neverland which is a beautiful world filled with fluffy clouds .Also there is a mean pirate named Hook and one of his hands is cut off and is a hook now.His hand is a hook because once when Peter pan and Hook were fighting Peter pan and it chopped off hooks and and he replaced it with a hook.Thats everything you need to know about Peter pan 
 As many reviewers have noted, I had a difficult time getting started with the dialogue in the book. Once I got used to it I realized how imperative it was to the story.  Stick with it past the first few chapters and you will see the light! The characters in this book are simply put "inspiring"! As a mother, I found it impossible NOT to draw strength and purpose from Ma Joad. This is a fantastic, emotional read and worth every second.  I doubt that there are authors of this caliber anymore.  The ending was unexpected and gut wrenching, but oh so appropriate!  I want so badly to know what happens to the Joad family.  (The sign of a good book when it leaves you wanting more!) If you like the premise of this book, try reading "The Good Earth" by Pearl Buck. John Steinbeck, wherever you are, I salute you 
  This set may be expensive, but it is worth every penny. Coltrane was at his peak in 1961. Although technically his playing would grow more sophisticated in later years, his level of inventiveness and inspiration are never better than here.  Prepare for many, many surprises. The previously unreleased material is still incredible. So for instance the totally unreleased Miles' Mode from the third night is an unbelieveably inspired piece. Other highlights I enjoyed include the Impressions from the first day (Dolphy is incredible on this track) and India from the fourth day.   Also, listen up for the crowd noises, which are preserved in their entirety. Before the third day's "Miles' Mode", Dolphy accidentally blows his horn, apparantly thinking Coltrane had given him the signal to begin. And now you can hear what the crowd is saying after the famous version of "Chasin' the Trane" - someone in the audience laughs and says "That was insane!!!".  I agree with thw reviewer who said that the final version of Spiritual is almost ruined by the ugly blatting noise of Garvin Bushell's contrabassoon - whether this is a result of inappropriate recording technique I do not know.  By the way, I have been through many articles and reviews describing the content of the discs, and I am amazed nobody has mentioned that the piece dubbed "Chasin' Another Trane" is actually a carbon-copy of a piece Coltrane recorded the previous year called "Blues to You". (Check the Atlantic album "Coltrane Plays the Blues - the attribution is particularly obvious if you hear the newly released alternate takes). The tune has NOTHING to do with Chasin' the Trane, being quite a different melody. Apparantly Rudy Van Gelder did not notice that the piece was already named!   Likewise the piece known as "India" is a piece from that same album called "Mr Knight".  This box set contains only four discs; but please remember that each disc contains about 70 minutes of music - twice the length of an LP album from the 1960s. There is no way any jazz fan could be disappointed with this set!!!   
 Being a Liberal (sometimes called "progressive") Christian, I have often found myself being looked down on by my liberal friends who are not religious.  In fact, I've found them to have a very "un-liberal" attitude towards my spirituality in general.  Lerner's book addresses this directly, head on, without flinching.   He explains how BushCo managed to seduce evangelical Christians into a skewed world view, in direct contradiction to the teachings of Jesus.  This book is helpful to everyone concerned with these issues, not just those who are religious.  I wish that all of my liberal friends would read it and learn! 
 The doctor's four, the lawyer's seven.  That joke, cracked by a Jewish buddy, goes some way towards explaining the 'traditional' dislike of Jews in general, which has sometimes tragically spilled over into outright persecution and genocide.  One of the reasons I have always clicked with Jewish contacts, who later became friends, is that they are highly intelligent and goal driven.   Yet this desire to be the best they can be, in business, in education, has often triggered jealousies in others, who resent the successes of the Jews, even though they have been honestly earned.  I agree with Lucien, that the idea that Jew haters have somehow been driven by some theological wranglings regarding the nature of 'the Jews' God' and the requirements of worship, never enters the head of most knee-jerk Jew bashers.  While some of Prager's ideas regarding the early development of anti-Semitism are worthy of attention, I think he perhaps underestimates how much of it has now and for centuries been literally the result of habit and 'passed down' hate mongering.  Everybody knows everybody hates the Jews, so they still do.  Also, the suggestion, however worded, that only anti-Semites see America as being Israel's big brother and protector, is very shaky, as historically alone, the US has always clearly and unequivocally supported Israel, the landmark act being the unprecedented airlift of weapons to bolster a flagging Israel, during the Yom Kippur War (Operation Nickel Grass).  It's a good book, and Prager is a fine writer who does his homework; I'm just not sure that all of his conclusions are bang on.  Shalom. 
 Okay, I saw the movie on TV. Sadly, It failed (as I said in my AOD review) but that's because all the good stuff was cut out. Then I rented it the movie, and I loved the original uncut version. Truly amazing! A great sequel.  STORY: Ash returns to the remote cabin with his girlfriend. The stay at the cabin turns into a nightmare. The next morning, He gets attacked by the unseen evil, and because of that, he unleashes Evil Ash. He tries to escape, but the bridge has been destroyed! Now, his hand goes all bad, which turns him into a one-handed zombie killer, and when people find him in the cabin, they dislike him at first. But when they learn what has happened to them, they must tam up with Ash.  OPINION: Awesome sequel! More gore, more excitement, and I love the ending. Waves the atmosphere ready for Army Of Darkness.  So go rent this sequel 
 To start this is NOT a detective story.  This is NOT a standard fiction novel.  This is NOT a nouveau roman in the style of Alain Robbe-Grillet's "The Erasers".  What this is, IS a stylized version of a man's endeavor to encounter himself and survive.  OK, this sounds almost as ambiguous as the book itself.  To my feelings (and IMHO), Auster is trying to look into the 'soul' of a character in a novel and bring him into our own thought processes.  It may just be a way for him to tell us about himself and how he has searched for himself, in a very unorthodox way.  His search is the story itself, and the wanderings of Auster/Quinn is his own anabasis.  His time in the alley and dark room, would then be his exploration of what is the minimum we truly need to survive, and not what we want in the ways of creature comforts.  He tells us what he IS trying to do in the book in his discussion of the Auster character's essay of Cervantes "Don Quixote".  He explicitly states the proposition there are questions as to who is the author of DQ.  Whether Cervantes is really DQ, and the whole story of finding the book in a bookstall and translating it into spanish from arabic is Cervantes way of giving up ownership to see how it will be perceived.    I don't think that the naming of the wandering character "Daniel Quinn" (DQ) is anything but a direction by Auster to this idea. That DQ uses his name, as Don Quixote represented Cervantes seem straight forward.  The next two volumes should make this clearer as the follow-ups are supposed to do in a trilogy. 
 For me, William Styron has written the standard from which to draw the historical novel. I say draw because an historical novel is just that; a novel. But even while the reader knows this, historical novels always seem to provoke some response framed by the light of a current outlook. This is ironic because the main attraction of historical novels (at least for me) is the escapist type pleasure that is found by immersing oneself in another world and time. This is the writer's accomplishment. William Styron does this in language and in pace so artfully that his book remains on my shelf. I keep 'The Confessions of Nat Turner' for its enjoyment and inspiration 
 At last, the 1st and 3rd album released on CD--Blues Image was a great band--check out the 2nd album Open-their best!!!  These two albums are also great with excellent vocals and great guitar. A little Latin rock thrown in, too. I saw these guys at the Fillmore in 1969--what a band. The third is the weakest of the three--Mike Pinera is gone and Kent Henry-guitarist (from Steppenwolf) replaces him--the vocals are not as good except when Joe Lala sings--but still a good album to have along with the first two. Get this and Open and you will not be disappointed!!!! 
 My daughter watches Clifford Puppy Days on PBS. I ordered her this DVD for a gift. She hasn't stopped watching it! This show, in addition to the regular big Clifford show, are fabulous shows for kids. Each show has a moral lesson.... both big and small. Plus it is so cute!!  
 Although Beth was "handsome or plain" in Lucien's eyes, and he was a perfect male, they made for a great couple.  Don't know why Beth's looks were dwelled on so much though, especially through Lucien's eyes.  It made him kind of shallow.  But I still loved this book, as I came to like Lucien in Nichola's story 
 Jess Lourey populates June Bug with sharply etched characters so vivid you'd recognize them on the street. Her protagonist Mira James is a gem of a heroine: she's a magnet for stray flying objects, she's addicted to Nut Goodies, and her wry observations on life abound with atypical honesty. When Mira learns there's a big diamond at the bottom of a local lake--and a fake diamond offered as a contest prize--she straps on diving gear and gamely goes forth to explore. But the clear lake water hides murky intents. She tangles with an unusual underwater hazard--and nearly loses her life. It's no surprise that Mira's not the only person interested in the loot. Larceny and licentiousness abound, and Mira's put herself squarely in harm's way.  Lourey's Mira is a clever girl, down on her luck, but plucky and resourceful. She goes through life fully engaged. Her observations both tickle and resonate. For example, "Actually I always wondered who had the energy to write on bathroom walls. Now I knew. It was people on bad dates." Say "Amen," Sister.  The Minnesota Department of Tourism either has a bounty on Lourey's head or added her to their payroll. She writes, "Minnesota is an incredible place to live, but we natives learn at a very young age that for this privilege we must pay a tithe, usually in blood...A summer day spent in the shallow, still part of the lake results in a chocolate-chip-shaped leech nesting between our peas-in-a-pod toes." Yuck! Lourey's clever pen captures such local gastronomic specialties as field-drinking, five-meat hotdishes, Tiger Pops, tuna surprise, Hamm's sky-blue waters, and barbecued spiced bananas. Mira moans that even the desserts feature cream of mushroom soup. Clearly, this book shouldn't be shelved with a Zagat's Guide.  But June Bug does deserve a spot on your "to be read" pile. Lourey delights and dazzles, making us eager to see what's on tap for July.     
 My husband and I purchased Avent bottles for our newborn after doing our research for the best bottles in helping minimize gas, colic etc...  Yikes!  Needless to say, we were HIGHLY disappointed with Avent.  By the recommendation of our pediatrician, we went out and bought a new set of Dr. Brown's bottles---kine of pricey, but WORTH every penny!!  With Avent, my son was getting super gassy and colicky.  He would cry so hard with gas pains that he'd clinch his little fists, crunch his little legs to his tummy and practically go hoarse.  Burping, mylicon and gripe water didn't even help.  Our days and nights were sleepless--he wouldn't nap because he was crying--and our nights would average about 3-4 hours of sleep.  Now, with Dr. Brown's---our son is a NEW little man.  He STILL gets gas, but not like he did with the Avent bottles.  All it takes is a couple of little pats on his back and he gives us a couple of good burps and he's out into LA LA land---he's now able to take his naps and has been sleeping anywhere from 6-8 hours through the night now for the past 2 weeks---and he's only 1 month old. :)    For some reason, when he was feeding from the Avent, he would suck uncontrollably, I'd see lots of bubbles in his bottle and in the nipple and I could hear him sucking all that air in.  With Dr. Brown's, he has WAY more controlled sucking, it's much more rhythmic and no air bubbles in the nipple!  MANY thumbs up for Dr. Brown's!  
 I am really liking Laura's style here on this CD! I originally bought the cd because I kept hearing "como so no nos hubieramos amado" in the radio. But now sometimes I will skip over it trying to get faster to "tan importante."  Her voice is as light yet powerful as ever. My favorite tracks are "Mi Perspectiva" "Escucha Atento" "Bendecida Pasion" "Tan Importante" and especially "Amar Completamente", which seems that every word could have been written for me. I relate so well to many of the songs on this album on different levels, and the emotion and sincerity of the words - even knowing they are adaptations - are very fluid and touching. I only wish I understood Italian so I could hear how they originally were meant to be 
 This book is excellent in providing the meaning and use of words that most people may not use in their everyday conversations.  However, for those who wish to improve in their understanding of such words and who want to have  greater understanding of the words used by educated persons, this is a  useful book 
 My motive for reading this book was, admittedly, not very historical.  Watching TV, reading the newspapers, I concluded that there was a major flood in 1927 which came down the Mississippi.  Because the monied of New Orleans feared that the "better part of town" might be in danger, they arranged to dynamite the levees in such a way that would divert the waters into St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes.  Certain eminent domain and financial arrangements were made (and later reneged on) and those who could and would be were evacuated.  All the same, many died and many more would made homeless, for the potential benefit to the few.  Then, or so I heard, the outrage of the masses in Louisiana at this miscarriage of power and justice by the rich led to the election of Huey P. Long (as champion of the "little guy") as Governor and launched a career.  Well, too bad.  This book doesn't go down that road at all.  The flood of 1927 is barely touched on.  Yes, it happened, but there is no mention of the dynamited dams.  Yes, Hoover came down and was in charge of federal relocation and recovery.  And in the meantime, Huey was running about the same campaign he would run for the rest of his life: Down with the Rich! Up with the Poor! and All Hail Huey!    Williams' biography is incredibly well documented.  You get the feeling that if you just tore out the bibliography, the notes, and the index, you would be forced to write the same book yourself, with one caveat:  some parts of the book were written from the author's notes of interviews and private communications the author had with some of the principals who were still alive when it was written through the 1950s and 60s.  The author has promised that all the notes have been archived and that while not of them can be released as yet, eventually, they all will be.  Williams is quite vigorous not so much in defense of Long as in definition of the man and his vision.  If you want to decide for yourself just what sort of man Huey Long was and where he might have been going, this biography is an excellent place to start. 
 Bought for my husband, he loves it. Very well done movie.  Violence abounds, so not for the faint of heart 
 Genetically engineered food has not been proven that causes obvious dangerous results.This is what the major food companies claim to be true and this is what they use as a strong argument for not labeling the products that contain genetically engineered ingredients. This book does what governments should have done around the world years now uncovers all the companies that use such ingredients after have been tested. Explains why the dangerous disinformation we get from the promoters of the gene foods can be dangerous not only for our health but for the future of humankind and goes even deeper analyzing the structure of this propaganda and how it works. At the end includes a list of companies with real organic foods and many sources like books lists catalogues web sites were you can find the informations you need to find what we should eat. I must mention that i had really good time reading this book and specially the part that mentions the six myths that the companies use to present us the genetically engineered food as the panacea that is going to save the world. I doubt that your life is going to be the same after you will gather all these information. P.S. it deserves five stars because it makes you feel much safer after you read it 
 I have only read a few Nicholas Sparks books (The Notebook & The Wedding), so I was eagerly anticipating beginning The Guardian, which had been recommended by me. I absolutely love Sparks' style of writing, and he did not disappoint with The Guardian. From the very first chapter, I was captivated. I felt like I was right there with Julie and Singer during all that ensues throughout the book (I don't want to spoil anything!). I laughed, I cried - I think I went through every emotion by the time I finished this book. That, to me, is the mark of a great book! I definitely recommend this book - it's a quick read and a great story that will not disappoint 
 A lot of ink has been spilled over Iraq during the past four years, and for good reason.  With any subject so controversial and contested, there will obviously be a lot of polemical and harmful writing from both sides of the argument, but thankfully, a lot of well-informed and intelligent writing as well.  With so much out there, sifting through it all can be demanding, but anyone that comes across The Assassins' Gate will have in their hands one of the true gems on the subject.  If you are only going to read one book on what is currently happening in Iraq, I passionately believe that this should be the book.  It's hard to tell exactly what you're going to get just by looking at the title and what's on the back cover, but I can assure you that all of the comments on the back (made by some of the most respected foreign policy critics) are dead on in their assessment.  What you'll find in this book is the story of how the U.S. (again) found itself in Iraq.  The beginning chapters foucs on the decision making process; who was making them and how.  This is perhaps the most well-written and intelligent description of these events, and I have read more than several of them.  You will gain more insight on how we got into this war from reading Packer's book than from perhaps anywhere else.  He gives the reader wonderful character sketches of people like Paul Wolfowitz, Robert Kagan, and Kanan Makiya.  These are the people that really had a large hand in what was happening, and by focusing on them rather than the bigger names like Bush or Rumsfeld, Packer does a much better job at explaining these events than his peers.  The rest of the book deals with Packer's personal experiences in Iraq during the war.  Each chapter deals with a different theme, such as the insurgency & the potential for a civil war, and while the scope of what's covered in the bulk of the book is somewhat more narrow than the first three or four chapters, Packer still gives the reader a very satisfying account of the war as a whole.  This book's biggest strenght is that it blends nearly flawless political analysis with the readability of a novel.  Packer is a superb writer and I found it very hard to put this book down.  From an academic point of view the book is close to flawless.  This in itself is very impressive, because it does not appear that Packer had much previous experience with Iraq.  I've read the works of those considered to be area experts and some of them can't even hold a match to Packer's work here.  This is exciting and depressing all at once.  I found this book to be particularly good because it also fit perfectly with my own personal feelings about the war.  As someone that wanted to see Hussein gone, I had to support the idea of removing him (and still do).  But beyond that initial decision, the way the Bush administration handled the war has been negligent at best, criminal at worst.  Packer has not written a polemical rant here, but by the end of his book, he lets you know that very real and harmful mistakes have been made.  He occupies that well-intentioned, but pragmatic middle ground that this debate so sorely needs.  This book will appeal to casual observers and serious analysts alike.  While books by Diamond and Feldman that cover similar themes are also excellent and should be read, Packer's book is by far the best, and I believe that no one can claim to truly have a grasp on what's happening in Iraq unless they have read this book.  We can only hope that Packer will continue to produce work of such extraordinarily high quality on this and other foreign policy issues 
 This is a classic movie that I use to watch at night with my dad who passed many years ago. Yet it still brings back the memories and interest that it did when I was a kid 
 This book was ahead of its time.  The clichï¿½s Pearl Buck captured 70 years ago still hold true today:    "Behind every good man is a strong woman."  "A fool and his money are soon parted."  "Money can't buy happiness."  "Women are the root of all evil."   Suggested appetizers:   Safeway sweet and sour sauce Egg Rolls Boneless Chicken Little smokies in BBQ sauce Fortune cookies  We were very fortunate that the ancient Chinese Proverbs from our fortune cookies harmonized with our initial comments and truly enriched our discussion.  "A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step."  "When you are poor, neighbors close by will not come; once you become rich, you'll be surprised by visits from (alleged) relatives afar."  "Without rice, even the cleverest housewife cannot cook."  A few other comments:   O'Lan truly was the Good Earth.   At the end of the book, you have to ask yourself: who really is the Poor Fool?  Signed,  The Ribbons and Rifles Book Club...tune in for next month's book review (The Glass Castle).  
 Wow!  I'm still processing this book.  It took me a couple of days before I was even sure that I liked it.  How to describe this book?  The weirdest book I have ever read.  Should you read it? YES!  This has all of the makings of the next Jerry Springer show all rolled up into an engrossing read.  Rape, sexually confused mom, semi-kooky son that has a very screwed up home life...you get the picture 
 I'm not sure how Kubrick could have made such a strange movie without somehow demonstrating his own strangeness. Oh, right.. 
 If you have been to Italy, especially San Gimignano, and want to return for the evening, this delightful movie is your ticket.  The tuscan country and views of the Medieval city are great.  Enjoy your evening!  The story and actors make the story come alive.  
 I've found this book to be an extremely helpful guide to writing modal music. The author has really thought out just about every piece of information that a songwriter or even serious composer would need to know to write a modal work. The detailed melodic and harmonic information is clearly presented either in tables or in the many very useful examples. Anyone with a short course or two in regular music theory could follow it.  In addition, the author presents a lot of interesting ideas and suggestions to improve the structure and coherence of modal compositions. Although my interest is mainly in songwriting and jazz related pieces, I found much of the material thought provoking and very practical. I would think that composers of complex music would get even more out of the ideas than myself. The included audio CD has recordings of most of the examples (played on a piano).  Also on the CD are 3 "study" compositions written by Cormier for a clarinet choir (each about 6 minutes long) which are a terrifically innovative way to present the material in more "realistic" fashion. (The study compositions are discussed in detail with the scores in the Appendices.) In short, an excellent reference and good value 
 Guy Hamilton is an opportunistic Australian journalist looking to make his name in Indonesia so that he can go on to bigger and better things. Hamilton (played by Mel Gibson) is lost amid a foreign culture and political machine so competely alien to him and  gets help from Billy Kwan (played in a cross-gender role by Linda Hunt), an educated native who is desperate to do something about the rampant poverty he sees every day. The two develop a partnership: Guy supplies the words, and Billy, the images. However, their partnership undergoes strain due to their contrary aims: Guy wants to break the story of Communist aggression and insurrection, while Billy wants to blow the lid off of the poverty in his country. Guy's response is that people don't want to hear about starving kids. Things are complicated when Guy falls for a British diplomat (Sigourney Weaver, whose beauty and brilliant performance make up for a marginal British accent) who gives him the story he wants, but broadcasting it may just be bad for everyone. At end of the movie, everyone has committed themselves to what they feel is important, and for some, it isn't what one would initially imagine them choosing.  This is another 80s gem from Peter Weir, who is simply brilliant in setting up an utterly realistic impoverished Indonesia circa 1965. The acting, as I mentioned, is excellent: Gibson has rarely been better, and Weaver is one of the greatest living actresses today. Linda Hunt got much recognition for the role of Billy, but this is no gimmick or Oscar-bait performance--Hunt shows a compelling portrait of betrayed patriotism. Weir, as in Gallipoli, shows a weakness for the music of the times, and there is some 80s synth in the movie again (this time, from Vangelis). Other than this, though, this is a movie which is compelling all the way through and comes highly recommended from this viewer 
 I like the author's approach to writing an introduction to the arts of China. Instead of trying to touch at least all of the major artists/works from all of the major periods (which in the case of China would mean touching very many things in a very cursory way), the author focuses on the context for which works were produced. Some of them were meant to be "art" from the start, some were not. This offers ample opportunities to examine how some works influenced other later in history. Overall, I think the ideas presented are some of the most gripping I have found in Chinese art history books. The book includes recent discoveries and scholarship and uses Pinyin romanization (two great features - not all recently-published books do) 
 Just want to agree with the previous reviewer. Although this session has been released many times before, this version is complete and in very good quality. it's worth the price just to hear Elvis talking on the Don't Be Cruel track about a fellow singers approach to that song - magic 
 Very interesting work. Goes over every aspect of manga - what it is, how it developed, and then different genres of manga - samurai series, manga showing japanese values about work, boys and girls manga, sports manga...every type of manga is described. There are also tons and tons of b&w images, not to mention a few color ones. If this wasn't good enough, Frederik L. Schodt is also a very articulate and interesting writer, and is able to express himself very well while keeping the material interesting. This is not all: the book comes with four samples of manga from Japan. My favorite in this group is Leiji Matsumoto's short story "Ghost Warrior," set during WWII. This book is more than just the sum of it's parts, though: It's also a fantastic introduction to manga, and can be read and enjoyed by even people who aren't fans of comic books. My highest reccomendations 
 This movie is a little bit hokie but the special effects are pretty good and overall it's a good movie.  It is a very different telling of the King Arthur story. The chief differences are that this story diverges drastically from Malory and that it is told from the viewpoint of Merlin instead of Arthur or Lancelot as the traditional renderings are. If you're looking for magical fun and adventure this is a good choice 
 A concise guide to assessing the level of 'leanness' in an organisation - useful for benchmarking. In addition it provides some useful guidelines for implementation 
 It's been some while since I actually looked forward to reading a book. I think it's probably because I spend a great deal of time down at the post office, to the extent where the staff actually knows me and greets me when I walk in...  Alfred Spangler, con-man extraordinaire, finds himself in a bit of trouble. He's been caught. And hanged. And then brought to the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork...to be given a choice. He can walk out of the door, or he can take charge of the post office and make it what it once was. The insitution has fallen by the wayside, playing second fiddle to the "clacks," a system of line-of-sight towers where semaphore messages can be transmitted rapidly and reliably. Astutely, Alfred chooses the post office, then makes an attempt to escape. His personal golem, Mr. Pump, fetches him back. This is the death of Alfred; he must use his own, unfortunate name henceforth: Moist von Lipwig. In doing so, he finds out what he really is. He is not sure that he likes it.  Thus begins a bizarre inner adventure: the discovery of corruption at the heart of the clacks system. His two colleagues are the ancient and crumbly Junior Postman Groat (none of the other postmasters ever survived long enough to promote him) and the perfect nutjob Stanley, pin collector and future stamp collector. They are hiding secrets. Dark secrets.  In search of information about golems, Moist meets a severely dressed, chain-smoking lady, Miss Dearheart, working in a charity to help golems gain their freedom. In her he finds True Love and a bitter twist that he can overcome only be admitting what kind of a person he really is-something he has never done before. This book works on so many different levels that it's almost breathtaking-it's humorous, poignant, and gives deep glimpse into human nature and how it can be manipulated. It is a story of inspiration, finding oneself, and the nature of freedom-both for Moist and for the golems he hires to deliver letters.  With shades of Brin's "The Postman" (the uniform turns the character into a different person, a symbol of hope), and perhaps a nod towards "The Matrix"-Groat certainly believes that Moist is "the one" who can restore the post office to its former glory-it is a tale of starting from rock bottom, of finding good where there seemed to be none. Moist turns his con-man skills towards winning the game, and he discovers that it is actually fun. "Going Postal" is funny, clever, and very, very enjoyable 
 This is really another excellent book I've seen on Java. Authors try to model/abstract real-world senarios into some "silly trivia" puzzles. You may say they are "Not puzzles, just silly trivia", but if you are experienced Java developer, you will figure out what they really mean and then smile on them. I have to say I was lost in some of those puzzles before in my real-world programming history...  It's not easy to address real-world problems in such a generic way. This book really makes the complication simple. Great job 
 Although my Panasonic DVD recorder/player was unable to "read" this disc, thus viewed it om my computor (a minor inconvienience), I found this to be a serious and well-done documentary...one that we all should see and share with everyone we know.  Where "Fahrenheight 9/11" was well-done for entertainment as well as information, this French film-maker created a documentary that delves more into the Bush Family history which is important to know in order to better understand where G.W. is coming from.  
 Robert Edwards description and analysis of the Dow Theory is, as Professor Bassetti so astutely states on page 48, a "magisterial presentation".  I am proud to have been asked to add my interpretation to the update since Dr. Edwards death. Believe it or not, the Dow Theory is alive and well in the 21st Century and this book will help you understand why. 		Jack Schanne 
 This film is best interpreted in a symbolic and allegorical way.  The plot is too implausible and riddled with inconsistencies to be taken literally.  Instead, what Logan's Run offers is a bizarre vision of the cult of eternal youth evolving into a police state.  Some of the scenes are riveting, such as the early depiction of sanitized mass murder carried out in a spectacular ceremony.  There are clear references to a commercial culture that glorifies youth and lives in denial about death.  The world depicted here is at once hedonistic and claustrophobic.  The environment is a kind of shallow, Disneyesque paradise from which there is no hope of escape.  The implicit subtext of the movie, that hedonism is a kind of deathtrap, is well taken.           
 The "Bear" (may we perhaps coin a new name for this most capable scribe?) demonstrates an expert's grasp of the deep dark and to a large extent still-unknown underwater world. This is a universe which is ancient, primordial, and covers two-thirds (give or take a few cubic metres) of the Earth's surface. Since homo Sapiens Sapiens hasn't yet evolved a set of gills in which to breathe, it remains difficult to get to know what this world is all about, but we're slowly learning. What's more, advances in technology have also permitted us to probe deeper than we ever have before, and somehow this makes not only the scientists who are part of these cross-functional teams feel good--  --um, sorry, I'm going off on a tangent there...you've come here to read about Greg Bear's WARM SEA.  This is a Short about the creatures, tentacles, things that go bump in the night. They're sometimes slimy, do occasionally emit ink and other disguising characteristics, and also have a strange aftertaste that would probably smell rather strange for the likes of us, we unsuspecting landlubbers here in Central Europe, who aren't accustomed to frequent interaction with the undulating waves of the sea.  All these details form the snappable building blocks which this scribe shifts around like child's play--such is his facility with the language. A sudden plunging into the drink, followed by a prize for the best splash...then a tumbling, below, deep, deep down--never to be found again.  Or so we think...  Why?  Who?  Under what circumstances?  Was this man upset about the utter collapse of his once-robust 401K? Was he miffed at something else? Perhaps at being cut off on the bustling freeway after having had his sedan repo-ed for non-payment of his monthly installments given the competition in the labor market, with all good jobs shifting to less developed parts of the world?  Hard to say. But the author dispenses with the extraneous backstory details and digs--nay, claws!--right on into the heart of this little yarn-ette.  Then...  A transition into the Cousteau-like underwater universe.  Where all manner of crustaceous seafood dwell before they end up on your white China in that five-star toni resto-bar you went with your partner last night to smooth over that rough patch the two of you have been going through of late. It was tough at the beginning, but as the night carried on--and after those escargot, that plate of frog's legs, and that delectable plate of scampi arrayed about your platter's marinade and polenta--you and she/he were well on your way to ressurrecting your non-starter of a relationship from the dead.  Next thing you know, the two of you were back in the swing of things and the argument soon seeped into the clutches of ancient history. The cool rush of the summer breeze against naked skin, and the plush feel of a mattress of just the right consistency combined with the silken touch of Egyptian cotten sheets (or Turkish) was just what Dr. Gordon ordered--  --wait, I'm digressing again.  Let's just put it this way. I'd love to catch some of Mr. Bear's longer work for myself. Admittedly, he possesses a craftsman's flourish. His gentle touch of pen--since ideally, this minimizes pain for the reams of paper which he may go through as part of the drafting process. (For those who don't know, paper has a tendency to "feel" as well)--combines in curly-cue concatenations of sentences, paragraphs, pages. Heck, folks, we've got a live one here! (Thought I'd throw in the a propos angler's analogy, just for good show).  This was a fun little read. Good show! Thanks to the author, it's clear that a sea can sometimes get warm from once-liquid substances other than the accidental omissions of a six-year old after too many trips to the Kool-Aid stand in the neighborhood's public pool.  -- ADM in Pragu 
 This document of actual events of real soldiers, real heroes, had me riveted when I first watched the actual HBO special.  Now, I have this amazingly humbling collection so that I can watch it whenever I believe that my own personal sense of self is lacking...I compare myself to these men and, no contest, I don't match up, so, I pick myself up, look myself in the mirror, and know that I have something of a measuring stick to go by.  From training, to D-Day, to the Battle of the Bulge to the Eagle's Nest, SPECTACULAR is what this piece of history is.  If you don't know what any of those references are that I just made above, well, pick this up, take Band of Brothers and make it yours, and LEARN 
 This book is definitely for serious aero engineering students. Very in-depth, very detailed. Don't expect light material for those who are with no background in some physics, statics and dynamics. Wish it had more examples for working on to better understand concepts, and more illustrations. Interesting book nonetheless 
 If, like me, you lament the state of science fiction today, and if, like me, you long to read stories that will transport you back to the days of the masters of "hard" science fiction--writers like Arthur C. Clarke, Robert A. Heinlein, Hal Clement and Malcolm Jameson--then this thick volume could be just what you're looking for.  In general, I find today's science fiction unreadable. Every once in a while, out of desperation, sheer boredom or an attack of unwarranted optimism, I pick up a new-release SF paperback, or check one out from the library. I am invariably disappointed. Some current SF books I can't even finish, whereas I continue to read the old ones over and over. I can't recall ANY memorable SF books written within the last 20 years. In my humble opinion, there are very few recent books that even begin to compare to the "hard" SF classics like "Space Cadet," "The Deep Range," "Mission of Gravity" or "Bullard of the Space Patrol," to name just a few.  "The Hard SF Renaissance," however, gives me some hope that all is not lost. If you're a fan of "hard" SF, the stories in this book should appeal to you. While I don't agree that they collectively presage a "renaissance" of the "hard" SF style, they are nonetheless all quite good and live up to their billing. I commend this volume to you if you want to read good, "hard" SF without having to pull out an old, dog-eared, brittle 1950s classic from your collection. 
 One of the best books I have read.  My students love I 
 Beyond Paradise is a wonderful, flirty, floral scent that isn't too overpowering. I recommend wearing it whenever you want to feel extra feminine 
 "Re/Search 8/9: J G Ballard", which dates from 1984, is the single best book that's been published on Ballard. This latest offering from Re/Search brings us right up to date, containing a variety of interviews and discussions with the author taken over the period 1983 to 2004. There's lots here on Ballard's usual themes - psychopathology, death of affect, and so on. But the guts of the book lies in the three lengthy interviews in 2003 and 2004, in the course of which Ballard also visits such contemporary issues as 9-11, neo-cons, globalization, the end of the 'Age of Reason', and terrorism. As a counterpoint, there's a series of more informal, and often amusing, discussions that the Re/Search people have had with Ballard over the years they've been associated with him.  Whilst the interviews don't quite reach the heights of those in "Re/Search 8/9: J. G. Ballard", it's a worthy addition to Re/Search's portfolio of books by or about J.G.B., and a great companion to "J. G. Ballard: Quotes". 
 This movie is about when Ash meets a pokemon In a race.the pokemon can turn in to a human.  ash does get confused becouse the pokemon latias turns  in   to a girl. but I dont whant to spoil it for all the ones who have not seen it. its sad but not as sad as the first movie. you have to relly wach it to understand it 
 I have all of Emily Luchetti's books and this one is just as amazing as the rest.  The Ginger Ice Cream is amazing.  Luchetti is an absolute goddess of desserts.  Creative, beautiful and beyond delicious!!  You can never go wrong with her cookbooks 
 I've been waiting to see this movie with english subtitles for over a year now (having heard how good it was).  If you are a big fan of movies like "Platoon" and Full Metal Jacket", then you'll love "9th Company". This film gives you a look into both the Russian military lifestyle and their service in Afghanistan.  The movie is very realistic; what one would expect from any modernday hollywood producer (unlike "Prisoner of the Mountains" with their cheap '70s quality war scenes).  I give this film a definate 5 stars and would rate it as one of the best foreign war movies ever made 
 The above partial quote is plagerized from Joes book as he quotes Charles Linderbergh comments about the 747 which in its entirety was " This is one of the great ones " I'm a retired Boeing Engineer, and while never meeting or dealing with Joe since I was working in other areas [supersonic transport, etc ] I did hear and work in later years with several who did have personal knowledge.  Joe pretty much tells it like it WAS/IS.   I especially  appreciated his efforts to avoid highly technical terms, and in few simple words explaining some of the basics of flight, powerplants, design criteria, safety concerns, etc.  In some ways, it could be considered ' high school' level courses on flight and design criteria- but without ' talking' down to the reader.   It is an 'easy read' and does lift the curtain on a few, but not all the insider political games typical of Boeing and most other aerospace companies. [ I've also  worked at Rockwell and Ling Temco Vought ]   Joe is definitely from the 'old school' as far as ethics and integrity, and his comments about serving on the Challenger Shuttle disaster commission   and the NASA attitude re safety and risk in the last chapter seem as if they were written this week [ June 16,2006- see news items about  safety concerns re the impending Shuttle flight in July 2006 ].   Hopefully, his comments and concerns will NOT be proven to be " deja vue all over AGAIN."   In my opinion -  a keeper, and  readable from Junior high up. 
 This is a Dan Brown book but has a feel of a James Patterson book.  It is a typical scandal in politics and as it unravels it is even more scandalous.  I thought it was enjoyable and had some interesting information about space and the ocean that will give you some educational value.  I enjoyed it a lot but wouldn't classify it as a best ever 
 On Judy Collins' twelfth album, she brings all of her diversity to the plate, creating a pastiche that really defines the title, "Judith"; for as her professional beginnings in pure folk are evidenced, they are joined by her classical, pop, rock, country and theatre leanings as well in a perfectly seamless blend.  See, Judy Collins is such a strong musical presence that she is able to take this wide gamut of musical styles and make each song her own.  "Judith" opens with Jimmy Webb's "The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress" on which her vocals soar above her beautiful piano accompaniment. "Angel, Spread Your Wings" is an airy, breezy folk-rock number on which she really does sound angelic, pardon the pun. She has also included here two countrified gems, Steve Goodman's "City Of New Orleans" and "The Loving Of The Game" as well as a rollicking version of The Rolling Stones' "Salt Of The Earth". These modern classics are balanced with the classic standards "Brother, Can You Spare A Dime" and her breathtakingly gorgeous version of "I'll Be Seeing You".  Judy had started her own songwriting upon Leonard Cohen's advice in the second half of the 60's and three of the songs here are her own magnificnet compositions: "Houses" is a lush, orchestral quasi-classical piece; "Song For Duke" is a beautiful epitaph for Duke Ellington; "Born To The Breed" is about her now-deceased son, Clark, and his coming of age at the time.  Of course, the really big show-stopper here is her immensely popular and perennially favored take on Stephen Sondheim's "Send In The Clowns". Her voice fits this song so perfectly and her phrasing is so immaculate that it's no wonder Judy's has become the quintessential version of this song.  Judy Collins' "Judith" is at the apex of artistic expression. It is a most wonderfully structured and performed set of songs which, ultimately, define who and what Judy Collins is about 
 Who doesn't love a good sexy holiday story?  DO YOU HEAR WHAT I HEAR by Lori Foster When Sgt. Ozzie Decker reluctantly agrees to watch over quirky animal psychic Marci Churchill, he's concerned about more than her  belief that she can  "talk" with animals;  he's also worried about keeping his desire for her under control.  These two couldn't be more opposite:  Marci is exuberant about life, while Ozzie is more negative, due to some bad experiences.  The sexual tension between these two, along with a stolen donkey thrown in the mix make for a funny, sexy story.   The chemistry between these two is instant, and eventually smolders  the pages!    I loved Marci when she appeared in Luscious' story in BAD BOYS of SUMMER, and was so excited when Ms Foster promised us Marci's story in this anthology.    This story is everything Lori Foster fans have grown to expect from her: witty dialogue, loveable characters, and steamy satisfying romance.   BAH HUMBUG, BABY by Gemma Bruce Allison couldn't wait to get away for the Christmas Holidays, until she learns she'll be spending time with her sexy ex, Lee Simonson.  Thanks to their interfering families, the two of them are snowed in at the ski lodge, and neither is too happy about it.  It doesn't take long for the old sexual sparks to flare up, though, and  things heat up at the lodge quickly!    This is a romantic, sensual read for the holidays.  This was the first story I've read from Gemma Bruce, but I'm definitely anxious to read more!    BY FIRELIGHT by Janice Maynard When a half-frozen Madison Tierney winds up on the doorstep of Grant Monroe's cabin, he doesn't expect the instant attraction he feels for her.  Grant wants to take things slow and get to know Madison, but the sexual heat between the two of them is intense.  When these two come together, things get HOT!  Janice Maynard always delivers wonderful sensual stories, and this one is no exception.  All three stories are wonderful, sexy, and romantic.  DON'T miss this one...it'll get you in the mood for some holiday snuggling for sure 
  I love this book...  I am a huge Picasso fan.  Enough said 
 Shooting Dr. Jack is an excellent first novel for Norman Green.  The book's characters come to life with Green's detailed descriptions.  His ability to describe characters, places and events is a rarity in todays books, and you feel as if his characters are actual people walking the streets of Brooklyn.  Once I started this novel and got to know these characters I could not put it down. I can't wait for Norman Green's second book, I am sure it will be full of more detailed and memorable characters, and surprises 
 This movie did not do well in the theaters, it got bad reviews, even Leguizamo has apologized for it. I don't care: this was one of the funniest movies ever! It has Jeffrey Jones, the guy from "Howard the Duck" and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." Now you know a film has to be hilariously corny if he is in it. The great thing about this movie is how Leguizamo acts like a live, human version of Bugs Bunny. This is the type of slapstick rarely seen in modern films. Further, Leguizamo mocks all people who think of race in solely black&white terms by his ethnic drag of all cultures. Too funny. And the "Latinus S___ticus" gag was rollover funny! I hated the homophobia and how gayness is rendered white only (as if Miami doesn't have many Latino, black, and Asian gay men), but still this movie is great 
 Everyone is different.  I only know myself, so I will share my story and you can take it for what it's worth.  I battled with some level of anxiety for many years, through most of my early 20's, I suppose, maybe earlier too.  Around the age of 25 I started to have some agoraphobic behaviors, wanting to get away when in social situations, having trouble getting in a car when someone else was driving, etc.; I started to avoid going out with my friends.  My symptoms and behaviors slowly worsened, but not to the point that they became debillitating.  Shortly after my 28th birthday I decided to return to graduate school after having been away from acedemia for 6 years.  My first three months back at school were extremely stressful, extremely stressful.  I was trying to balance my school work with starting research, on top of that I was teaching (which was insanity for me considering my fear of public speaking), trying to make friends and keep my marriage together.  Towards Christmas I started to suffer from daily headaches.  Around November I had my first full blown panic attack.  I didn't know what was happening, I thought I was dying.  Most of you know what I'm talking about.  I made it to Christmas, and returned home to visit my parents.  I thought the time away from school would allow me to recover, but the opposite happened.  That two weeks was the most difficult two weeks of my life.  I was in a constant cycle of panic.  Each morning I would wake up and bolt upright in bed, immediately the fear and adrenaline would start, I'd wonder if I'd ever be able to take care of myself, wonder what my relatives and friends must think, I'd shake and have heart palpitations, the clock ticking would crash through my head like a bass drum, I'd sweat and have diarrhea, I couldn't eat or sleep or be around people, I feared time alone with my thoughts.  I thought I had gone crazy, lost it, that's how I'd spend the rest of my days.  This went on for two weeks.  Two weeks does not sound like a long time, but I would compare that mental anguish to the most severe physical pain you can imagine.  I won't paint any graphic imagery because if you're reading this then you probably know what I'm talking about.  It was the most intense pain that I have ever endured.  I was SURE I could not return to graduate school.  I thought I might need to be put in an asylum.  Somehow a friend got word of my condition and offered me this book.  Just reading the first chapter made me feel so much better.  I tell you in all honesty, this book changed my life.  It took a lot of work and a lot of time and then more work, but I turned my feelings completely around.  I am more self-confident now, two years later, than I have ever been in my life.  I have not had a panic attack in perhaps 18 months.  I KNOW that I am in control.  Again, the change was not instantaneous; I had relief from some of the acute symptoms fairly quickly, within days or weeks, but it took several months for me to stop having panic attacks on a daily basis.  Given the title of the book, it sounds cliched for me to say this, but I truly have taken all of my negative attributes that started my panic cycle in the first place and turned them around so that they help me succeed.  I am realizing dreams that I never thought possible.  Somewhere in the book Lucinda says that she's happy she went through her panic/anxiety disorder because it has made her a stronger person than she would have ever been.  I remember reading that the first time and thinking what a load of crap that was.  But now I feel the same way.  Few things in my life have so defined and limited me as my panic and anxiety, and now that I'm in control of my feelings, nothing could be more powerful.  Good luck 
 Okay, there's a word on there that would embarrass me in front of the missus, who thinks even Chicago can be too hard rock at times (go figure). But I really do love the album, and am glad they're still trying hard to please their many fans - and their own toughest critics, themselves. I appreciate liner notes that tell what goes into making the songs, and am just generally pleased as heck with their latest effort 
 James Henry Trotter lives a miserable life with his unpleasant relatives Aunt Spiker and Aunt Sponge.  When a mysterious old man gives James cooked crocodile tongues, strange things begin to happen.  A peach the size of a house grows on a withered tree in the aunt's garden.  James crawls inside this peach and finds it full of friendly oversized bugs,each with an amusing personality. James and his new bug friends journey from the aunt's garden and eventually end up in New York City after many exciting adventures. The goregous imagery,endearing songs and unique characters found in this tale have delighted a wide range of readers. This book is a joy to read and shall work it's magic on who all read it.     
 This is a wonderful book about changing patterns in U.S. family life.  It includes thought provoking theological reflections, ethicial analysis, and practical suggestions 
 After seeing a lot of documentaries made on the Da Vinci Code, which essentially try to verify the story by Dan Brown, THIS ONE tells the whooooole truth about the "Da Vinci Code".  It presents evidence that the other documentaries ignore, because they want to go with the ride of Dan Brown's novel.  For example, that the Dossier Secrets are all forgeries, that the Priur? de Sion was a fraud created in the 1950's, that there is no such Merovingian dynasty present today, that Pierre Plantard is not a Merovingian descendant, and that the Merovingian dynasty does NOT descend of the Jews (which has been historically and genetically confirmed), that Margaret Starbird is essentially wrong about her theory of how Mary Magdalen went to France,that the Holy Grial has nothing to do with the bloodline, that all of Da Vinci's paintings can be explained WITHOUT supposing him knowing anything about Jesus and Mary Magdalen, etc. etc. etc.   And STILL people like Michael Baigent insists that there has been no evidence against the main thesis of "Holy Blood, Holy Grail", when Henry Lincoln has publically admitted that their work in that book HAS NO SCIENTIFIC VALUE WHATSOEVER!  And what about the so-called researchers like Lynn Picknett and  Clive Prince in their extremely poor research in their book "The Templar Revelation" or Margaret Starbird's credentials in her "Woman of the Alabaster Jar"?  They are all discredited!  If you really want to get rid of all this "Da Vinci Code" madness, the authors of this documentary hosted by Tony Robinson is great!  The other book recommendation is "The Da Vinci Hoax".  Feel free to embrace the truth over sensationalism 
 This box set contains five Ealing Studios comedies from the fifties that are just great examples of this genre of films. I had seen Whiskey Galore and a Run for your Money before so the other three were new to me. I liked the Titfield Thunderbolt the best and the Maggie the least, but all are fine movies with typical English humor and good casts (Look for Charles Hawtry of "Carry On" fame in Passport to Pimlico). The set is a bit pricy, but if you love the British comedies of this era, it's not to be missed 
 I really enjoyed this book from the first page. Nora Roberts just makes you feel as though you know the characters so well. It is a wonderful 3 part story of 3 sisters of the heart. It takes you through each of their lives and their evolution into the women they are today. This first book is focused on Margo, a maid's daughter. She has huge dreams and sets out to find them and make them come true. Read this book to see her set out, find and lose her self and then come full circle back to the place she started out 
 This is the second time I have seen this film and I enjoyed it just as much this time as the last. It is sad and sentimental with a touch of love and sex and very real. I can't imagine what I might do in her situation but I don't think I could do better than she did. Lovely, a real weepy 
 I had, already nearly 20 years ago, browsed passages of Gibbon's original, and used it as a reference. But I had no desire to plow through the complete unabridged six volumes.  Finally, I decided to look for an abridged version, and I found Mueller's. Long and detailed enough to catch all of Gibbon's high points. He also keeps enough of the original to capture Gibbon's style and love of subject 
 Just when you think he's figured it out, he hasn't, but he does!  I wish I'd lived then 
 Back in 1993, it wasn't easy to hear much around besides grunge. Yet, Radiohead's "Creep" managed to make it in between Nirvana's, Pearl Jam's and Green Day's hits to catch the ear of many who -like me- continue to be devoted fans of their work to this day.  From the opening guitar line of "You" it is hard not to get caught by the magic of their musical phrasing. This is all pre-Oasis, pre-Travis, pre-James. This is indie prog rock in the making, with these guys fabricating a new electric sound in songs like "How Do You?" and balancing it off in others like "Thinking About You" where the acoustic guitar can be just as powerful. Then, combining the two in "Ripcord" and making you feel like rock music first started to be played like this.  "Pablo Honey" is not Radiohead's best work (that honor would probably belong to "OK Computer"). Yet it's an extraordinary production and an even more amazing debut. Many bands since and before them would want to have their best album ever be half as solid as Radiohead's first one.  Own it 
 so i JUST got the cd finally, and therefore cannot make a complete analysis of the cd. that said, "jerusalem" was the first song i had heard off the album, which was enough to convince me to buy the cd. "the light" is a wonderful song, when she sings "raaaaiin" and "complaaaaiiin"!!! oh, her voice is just amazing! "the struggle" is a great song as well, but really, they are all good. i think the cd opens with a great song as well, and just takes you on a nice journey. i wish she hadn't decided to go on a year-long hiatus...i can only imagine how great it must be to see her live. 
 Got the book quickly - and in good shape - Thank yo 
 I was given this book to read by a Professor when i was doing a Masters Program, upon asking him that i want to know and read a little about Game Theory. Well i liked this book so much that i went online and a bought a copy of my own.  Although, this book was first published in 1996 and for what i reason that i am unable to comprehend is not available with all that ease in book stores. But it was an easy find on Amazon.Com.  This book is ideal for someone like me who saw the movie " A beautiful Mind" and was intrigued by what the main character was doing in the first half of the movie, when he uses Game Theory to come out with a result as to how they can all win without anyone actually losing.  What this book does for a student of Business is, it tells you with Umpteen real world examples; how to make use of game theory in business.  Their easy explanation of and the coining of the term 'The Value Net' is a prime example of what they have done in this book.  All in All, a very good read for everyone, I would highly recommend it to anyone, simply because it is easy to understand and tackles a complicated subject with ease 
 I have read many of Joseph Campbell's books. I have not read any of Frey's other works (but I'm ordering "How to Write a Damn Good Novel" today), but I have read "The Key" - and I felt it was a good book.  I thought this book very entertaining and quite useful. I have seen other reviews that claim this book is "The Readers Digest version" of Campbell's work, and other such statements. In Frey's defense, Campbell's work doesn't teach you about writing, it teaches you about Mythology. Those reviews don't make good comparisons; so, instead I will compare "The Key" to a similar work I have read: Steven King's "On Writing".  King's "On Writing" is wonderful, inspirational, and entertaining. I would say the same for Frey's "The Key". Where King's "On Writing" is more about how he writes, with suggestions towards your writing, Frey's "The Key" is more "step by step". "The Key" seems more for beginners, but I could see a more advanced writer gleaning some good ideas from it, or coming to realizations they had not thought of before.  "The Key" is a bit repetitious, much as a basic text book might repeat key ideas; however, I find this useful and not overdone. I also appreciated the many examples given, and the example story. This is something that is often missed in any sort of "How to" book. I tend to learn better from examples, so I really appreciated that effort 
  *** REFERS TO CD RECORDING ****  After picking up and putting down the book countless times I finally listened to this on CD. The time and attention I didn't have for the print version came easily for the audio recording.   Guiness is an engaging and enthusisatic speaker in full command of his subject matter. He draws on foundational Christian truths, historic and contemporary references, anecdotes, and a solid business acumen. He routinely distinguishes between what something is and is not (eg; vocation, calling, surrender) in unequivocal terms. Also, he consistently makes the point that the main reason for our existence is to glorify God; everything else in his presentation simply ties-back to this truth. He explains how we get distracted, how others have, and how we can correct our path, again providing examples. And unlike the Christianity Lite trend in America that often promotes wealth without work or responsibility, Guinness is explicit about the sacrifice inherent in a Christian life, using for example the lives of Leonidas, St. Francis, and Bonhoeffer. He also speaks of the joys of a truly God-centered life.  I recommend THE CALL to anyone who is listening for their own call. It will help you distinguish between a calling and wish-fulfillment/fantasy, acquaint you with others who have heard their call, and inspire you to act. If you've already heard and responded to your call, you'll recognize Guinness as a fellow traveler.   This 3-hour presentation was taped live at Highland Park Presbyterian Church in Dallas, Tx USA. The recording includes 3  audience Q&A sessions of about 10 minutes each. These were as informative as the main presentation, often reflecting the very questions I had while listening.   Recording was produced by Wpublishinggroup.com in Nashville, TN USA 
 Embittered and depressed by her divorce, and estranged from the grown daughters who side with their professor father, Candida Wilton moves from a comfortable suburban house to a grubby, walk-up apartment in Central London and documents her new life in a computer diary, the first and longest section of the book.  Dreary, depressed and priggish, but tartly observant, Candida describes her brief excursions through the local streets to her health club, which was formerly an adult education college where she took an evening class on Virgil's "Aeneid." She took the class - and then joined the health club - with an idea to meeting people unlike those in her previous life in academe. But: "Already I was wary about making friends with the kind of person who would want to be friends with a person like me."  This line says much about what is endearing and annoying about Candida - her sour depression and her intelligent self-mockery. She spends most of her time alone, reaching out tentatively to women from the Virgil class, having a grudging lunch with an inquisitive friend from her former life and defensively bracing for a  visit from her brash, brazen and successful old school chum. In the dirty, littered streets, she is a sharp, alien observer of everything from the "shocking" condition of the pavement to the impenetrable advertisements and graffiti posted along the way: "I couldn't decode any of the messages."  Candida reflects on her life and marriage, motherhood and age ("There was more to look forward to, but less to possess. It's the other way round now"). She's merciless, to herself as well as others and readers may well come to sympathize at least a little with the faithless husband. Then Candida comes into a small windfall of money - enough to lighten her tone and spur her to new heights of initiative - organizing an excursion from Tunis to Sicily and Naples to follow in Aeneas' footsteps. She recruits her friends from the Virgil class as well as her two older friends and the second part of the novel takes off in a completely different vein.  The third person narration is upbeat, the wit still wry but less mordant, the characterizations sharp and perceptive. The plot also heats up in this section, and the two following sections, with revealing, unexpected, and sometimes unlikely, twists. The novel is perceptive, clever and surprising. Though Candida occasionally makes you want to give up on her, Drabble ("The Peppered Moth," "The Witch of Exmoor") keeps you going with her acerbic, pitch-perfect prose and Candida's refusal to give up on herself.  
 This music has some of the rough, up-in-your-face quality of Patti Smith ("Easter" "Horses") and of course the Sex Pistols.  The more mainstream, pop melodies are not integrated as much with the rancor as they are on "9."  However, this gives you something almost as good, as the juxtapositions are generally very well executed.  The catharses are more simplistic, but often more freeing.  Primitive, prowling, "Gang of Four" rhythms blossom into the fragrant flowers you associate with U2.   "Compact Disc" has the peculiar distinction of having a lot of great dance rhythms and melodic riffs woven into Johnny's otherwise insane warbling.  The guitar work is sometimes jarring and overdone, though some of it is remarkably fast and pure.   Of particular interest are the beautiful melodies on the second and last tracks.  On "Ease," Johnny confides, "What makes you happy, your misery."  These two PIL albums rank right up there with the Beatles, Stones, Bowie, etc. that made monumental music from the grist of this statement.  
 Eventough I didnt receive the "password" or information (piece of paper with pass and info.) to access the online resources for this book, the shipp was fast and the book was in excellente conditions. Good luck,  
 Musical Content: 4 stars Sound Quality: 3 stars Packaging: 2 stars Bang for the Buck: 4 stars  The clarinet is usually such a polite, sweet instrument in the hands of most of its best known masters (Goodman, Shaw, Bigard,...). But Pee Wee Russell has a very sharp, aggressive edge to his tone; be careful handling the CDs, you might cut your fingers. The first 3 CDs, recorded between 1933 & 1944, all feature him as a member of the long-standing Eddie Condon (banjo) band that was headquartered out of Nick's Club in Chicago. Heavily slanted toward dixieland (but with an edge), the mostly uptempo numbers here are a lot of fun, and the occassional down tempo tunes give PWR a chance to show his pretty side. But he was never really satisfied with the "Nixieland" ghetto his playing was trapped in with this group; there is a distinct lack of variety to this material. None of his early work with the exciting Mound City Blowers, or his 50's work when he finally took control of his music and formed his own bands. While a very dominant side man with this group, he does often have to wait his turn to solo. As a jazz experience, 3.5 stars but for sheer cheerful upbeat whoopie 4.5 stars.  The last CD is a 1961 session with Coleman Hawkins with a very solid rhythm section (PWR was not great at keeping his own time). It's a pleasant if sedate set, playing with Hawk as he had 30 years earlier in the Mound City Blowers. The playing, however, shows Pee Wee and Coleman powers fading somewhat as they both neared the end of their careers. Pee Wee plays a lot sweeter and works the lower register a lot more than on the Nixieland pieces. The old masters seem to push each other, there are some high points, and the set is of historical interest. A nice bonus, if less than scintillating on its own.  The sound quality is fair; given the direct-to-disk recording methods of the time. There's no noise, but there is noticable distortion in some of the trombone and trumpet playing. And on some tracks, there is a distinct "listening from the next room" reverb applied either during the original recording or the remastering process. I suspect the latter, since many other Quadromania disks suffer this way. The sixties set on CD4, of course, sounds much better.  The 4 CD holder, while otherwise well designed, suffers because the teeth that should hold the CDs in place let go and/or break during travel or handling. The documentation lists accompanying musicians and recording dates, but no biographical or other information

 In this early work, leadership expert John C. Maxwell lays out 10 principles of leadership and team building. According to Maxwell, leaders are not born; instead, they develop their skills throughout a lifetime of practice. Perhaps because he was a minister for 25 years, Maxwell is somewhat overly fond of well-worn anecdotes and even ditties, but some readers will find that his charts, pull-quotes, bulleted lists and cartoons help make his ideas easily accessible. We recommend this book to beginning managers who want to learn leadership and to experienced ones who want to progress farther 
 I was already a fan of the movie and it's Tangerine Dream score when I found out about this rejected score by my all time favorite composer. I looked for a rare CD release for a few years, but never found it. I was so excited when I found this expanded reissue from Silva Screen. Immediatly upon hearing it, I could picture the scenes in the film the music was written for perfectly. Goldsmith had done such an overwhelmingly beautilul job scoring LEGEND, I couldn't reason why the music had been replaced. On the other hand, this magical film received two excellent scores. All the better in the end. Truly Fantastic!            
 As usual this condensed book on "basics" meets the optimal needs of the "minimalist". The book is well written, comprehensive, easy to understand, and extremely pratical for "anyone" who cooks, wants to learn how to cook, or needs to improve on their cooking skills.  The supplier must be complemented as well, for providing a good price combined with excellent service 
 Just got this disk yesterday, I like this one a lot better than Backyard Beat Show. If you like REAL honky-tonk music, give this a listen and you'll be dancing and hollerin' like a madman in no time a'tall 
  "They used to hang men at Four Turnings in the old days. Not any more, though...."  I'm a mystery writer, and Daphne du Maurier was one of my earliest inspirations. REBECCA is her masterpiece, followed by two other novels, THE SCAPEGOAT and this 1951 bestseller. The opening sentences of MY COUSIN RACHEL (above) are second only to the immortal opening line of REBECCA.  In 1840s Cornwall, young Philip Ashley inherits the fortune of the uncle who raised him, who has recently married abroad (Italy) and died under mysterious circumstances. Philip's pleasant life is disrupted by the sudden arrival of  his uncle's beautiful widow, Rachel. Initially planning to send her on her way with a generous pension, he soon finds himself falling in love with her--even as he begins to suspect that she murdered his uncle and may be planning the same fate for him.  Rarely have I read a novel in which the tension and suspense arise almost exclusively from character. Who is this woman? What is she doing? How is the young hero going to respond to her? These questions have haunted readers since the book first appeared, and they will continue to do so for a long time to come. Reading the book again after all these years, I was amazed by du Maurier's plotting, her use of language, and the way she can create an atmosphere of foreboding that is almost palpable. Writers can learn a lot from this master, and RACHEL is a must for anyone who loves the very best in suspense.  PS: The 1952 film version, with Olivia de Havilland and an incredibly young Richard Burton in the leads, is also excellent. 
 The last priest of Holy Wood, a sandy little hill near Ankh-Morpork, dies without a successor.  Were his daily chants and rituals actually holding something at bay, or were they the meaningless drivel of a dead religion?  Soon after his death, an alchemist in Ankh-Morpork invents the moving picture--the difficult part was to keep the film from exploding.  Victor Tugelbend, perpetual student-wizard and "the laziest person in the history of the world" sees the first moving picture projected on a sheet in an Ankh-Morpork square.  The next thing he knows, Victor is on the road to Holy Wood, along with C.M.O.T. Dibbler, low-life purveyor of 'sausage inna bun' and Gaspode, the Wonder Dog (the only one of the three who was smart enough to hitch a ride in a lumber wagon).  Holy Wood is now a ramshackle town, thrown together practically overnight and overflowing with humans, dwarfs, and trolls who want to make moving pictures.  Companies like 'Century of the Fruitbat Moving Pictures,' and 'Floating Bladder Pictures' are cranking out two-reelers like 'Sword of Passione,' 'The Third Gnome,' and 'Turkey Legs.'  Victor falls into the role of leading man.  Dibbler extorts his way into the role of leading producer.  Victor's leading lady, Ginger keeps dreaming that she's standing on a grate with hot air blowing up her skirt---that is when she's not walking in her sleep and trying to wake Something slumbering in the cave beneath the brand new city.  Reality is stretching thin between worlds.  When Dibbler decides to make a moving picture about Ankh-Morpork's Civil War, called 'Blown Away,' Holy Hell breaks loose.  "Moving Pictures" is Pratchett's satirical look at everything Hollywood, with puns and allusions rocketing overhead like shooting stars.  Many of his references are way over my head, e.g. 'Floating Bladder Pictures' and a moving picture called 'Turkey Legs,' but movie aficionados should nail down every one.  At least I figured out the golden statue named Oswald (or Osric), and the gigantic woman climbing the Tower of Art with a tiny ape clutched in its hand.  Basically, a good time is had by all in "Moving Pictures."  Although it is not as deeply philosophical as some of Pratchett's Disworld novels, Gaspode, the Wonder Dog does have some great lines, especially when he's shooting the breeze with the Rabbit, the Mouse and the Cat, and the Duck (waack waack waack waack!  Sorry Walt). 
 "Origins of Marvel Comics" is one of those books you pick up and simply cannot put down!  Great commentaries by the Excelsior himself, Stan Lee, the reader discovers what inspired the creations of such heroes as The Incredible Hulk, The Amazing Spiderman and The Fantastic Four, to name a few.  Not just for Baby Boomers, "Origins of Marvel Comics" is recommended reading to anyone who loves comics books or to those whoever wondered where popular culture came from.  Read on

The newest blood tests give you a clearer picture of your personal heart disease risk than you could ever get from simple cholesterol (HDL and LDL) readings.  He gives you concrete suggestions about diet, exercize, medications, and supplements. All of this from one of the researchers who has spent the last 20 years treating patients and studying heart disease.  This book gets my highest recommendation 
 I'm kind of baffled at how almost every review posted of Master Of Reality describe that album as Sabbath's "best work", yet most reviews of Paranoid cite it as "one of their best" or say "completists should own this". Don't get me wrong, Master Of Reality is a great album, and easily ranks with the band's best material. But to disregard Paranoid and not recognize it for what it is-the single best Metal album in history-is a major head-scratcher for me. Of course, everyone is entitled to their opinion. But Master Of Reality simply didn't match either the historical impact, quality of songs, or overall sound of Paranoid.   Of course, one wouldn't want to overlook Sabbath's self-titled first album, especially if speaking in terms of historical impact. While not the first heavy rock album to blow out speakers with distorted guitars and cacophonous drumming, all you need to do is hear the first unbelievably colossal chord struck in the song "Black Sabbath" to (by the time you're done changing into a clean pair of pants) recognize this as the arrival of the form of music known as Heavy Metal. That song was recorded almost 40 years ago, and it still has the power to terrify unsuspecting listeners to this day. And, while I feel that the song "Black Sabbath" is still heavier than anything put out since (even downtuned sludge-mongers like Eyehategod, Electric Wizard, Melvins and SunnO))) can't match the song's power), the album still had some weak points; weak points that would be completely eradicated in time for their 2nd album, Paranoid.   What still always gets me about Paranoid every time I pop it in and the first notes of "War Pigs" come through my speakers, is the utterly desolate and raw production. When that song's meandering intro abruptly gives way to monolithic power chords chopped up by long pauses, when the thudding bass drum kicks off "Iron Man", when Ozzy's voice cuts through the oppressively doomy progression of "Electric Funeral"...there is no warmth or gloss to these moments. The whole album sounds as though it is being transmitted to you from a shack at the fallout site of a nuclear explosion, somewhere completely isolated in the desert, in the darkest and most deathly still hours of the night. But at the same time, the unchecked power of Tony Iommi's mammoth guitar riffs evokes images of erupting volcanoes and 8.8 earthquakes. And let us not forget the perfectly loose interplay of Bill Ward's pounding drums and Geezer Butler's plodding yeat fluid bass. Nothing against the uber-precise technical riffing of death metal and grindcore, but it was at one point called HEAVY Metal, and with good reason. While speedy, thrashy riffing has the ability to assault the listener much as an arsenal of machine guns, the lumbering rhythms laid down by Sabbath completely destroy, like an elephant crushing you under one foot until you can't breathe and every bone is broken in your body. THAT is heavy.  Even "Planet Caravan" (which I admittedly didn't like upon first listen when I first bought the album way back when I was 12), in its calm, almost jazzy quietness, still sounds unearthly and frightening. It is perfectly in place as the final (and only) relief from the sheer volume before "Iron Man" comes in and commences the rest of the album's terrifying descent into madness.   Through the wah-drenched evil riff of "Electric Funeral", the harrowing post-war drug addiction tale of "Hand of Doom", right down to the galloping storm of the album-closing "Fairies Wear Boots" (with its darkly melodic guitars and oddly twisted hallucionagenic lyrics, one of Sabbath's all-time classics), this is all absolutely essential Heavy Metal.   And of course, I can't go without mentioning the title track. With its instantly recognizable opening guitar riff (which is never repeated once the song abandons it in its driving mid-paced rhythm) and desperate lyrics about depression and the protagonist's recognition of his own state of mental decay (no one can ever forget the opening line "Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind."), the song "Paranoid" summarizes all of the anguish, frustration, and insecurity of passing from youth into adulthood in just 2 and a half minutes.  Since Black Sabbath first exploded into existence with their eponymous first album and song, Metal has evolved into countless styles, froms, and variations. I love most all of it, from sinister Black Metal like Darkthrone, Bathory as well as Emperor, to Speed Metal/Thrash like Slayer, Sodom and early Metallica, to ridiculously epic power metal such as Blind Guardian, Manowar and Hammerfall, to skull-crushing Doom/Drone/Sludge like the aforementioned Electric Wizard, SunnO))), and Eyehategod. But one thing all of these artists have in common (not to mention unapologetic Sabbath copycats like Sleep, Pentagram, and Saint Vitus), is their debt to Black Sabbath. Without their first four albums, and especially the albums Black Sabbath and Paranoid, there would be no Metal, regardless of what style you play. And, in my opinion, Paranoid is the one album that displays this music at its most powerful, dangerous, and absolute best. If you don't already own it, what the hell are you waiting for 
 When I listen to ten i don't think of it as a grunge album just a strait out rock album a very cool one. This is there first grunge album and it is great IMO there is more memorable songs on it like daughter distant and reviewmirrior that have a more grand sound then say black or even flow. You also have rockes animal leach go which are all good this is a great album that in may ways is better then Ten I have yet to hear the new one but what I have herd it my beat there first two 
 its wonderful!  very challenging, I'm a total beginer, but it gives you the idea of the belly dance motion.  it works you up, you start slow then go faster, when I do this I think, ok I cant do all of this now, but I know I'll be able to if I keep at it.  its very good I highly recomend i 
 This book has some solid advice with regard to some real estate investment methods I was not aware of.  I'm in the process of aquiring several investment properties, and I've used this book as a resource 
 Warning: The first three discs are IDENTICAL to the America's Great Road Trips, and Scenic Drives discs (I don't mind because I always want a good backup) minus the Road Trips discs. I don't regret getting America's Most Senic Drives (even though they are repeats on the first 3 disks) as the bonus disk of America The Beautiful makes it worth while(which is real good, but has nothing to do with the popular attraction at Disneyland). I may not regret it, but you might. 
 David Wellington can tell a frickin' zombie story!  Monster Island was terrific, but Monster Nation goes a shambling step further to provide a deeper, more passionate story that possesses a strangely lyrical quality while at the same time managing to send shivers right up the spine.  That takes talent.  If you've read Monster Island...then read this right now.  If you haven't read Monster Island (and...what's the matter with you?) then get that one and this one.  This is the Grand Epic of the Zombie mythology 
  The Shield is one of those shows I think that will attain even more pop culture status as time goes on, even long after it leaves the airwaves. The show is centered on cops who do corrupt things in order to ultimately put a major smash into the drug and arms trades in Los Angeles. I've spent my reviews of season one and two going in depth on how the camera's angles are unique and how each character has a ton to contribute to the show. This time I'm simply going to tell you little bits and pieces of what is going on with season three, and it will probably not make any difference because if you have already seen one and two, you know you have to go back for more!  Season three tends to get deep in two areas. The one area is the character development. Mackey's ongoing separation from his wife, coupled with finding out his second child is also autistic is a big downer, but besides that he's also laying pipe everywhere east of L.A. so it apparently isn't bothering him as much as he'd like to let on. Things between him and Shane Vendrell start to go south quickly. Shane and Vic were always good friends but as the pressure for the team to produce results as well as keep secrets and stay within boundaries mounts, Vic starts pulling back, starts easing off. This action does a boomerang effect for Shane Vendrell, who launches forward with more reckless abandon on cases than never before!  Despite all the drama in their personal lives (Yes, Julian the African American cop, is still gay, still a devout Christian to the point of fanatically, and still married to a women he's trying to have a child with) the street lives are alive more than ever. Rival Gangs, horrible hit squads, CI's (Confidential Informer) and sting operations happen in a one two three punch combination throughout the series.  Kicking off-season three, we have two gangs who are bad, mad and territorial. They are the Byz Latz and the One-Niners. Oh and did I mention they both acquire massive amounts of MP-5 submachine guns to try and further their struggles?  The Armenian mob of course, is still in the ongoing storyline from season 2, and its not getting pretty. People are still showing up with they're feet cut off, and it looks like they are not going to stop. Where did their money go, and who shot two of their men when it was taken? Oh well, excuse us, we're the Armenian mob, and our money train is gone, so its time to hack off more feet! Speaking of the money train, Vic decided to use some of it in an undercover operation, only to accidentally circulate it back into the drug trade. What Vic doesn't know is that there was someone else watching the Armenians, and slipped in ten thousand dollars worth of MARKED BILLS.  The Strike team is in hot water as well as the "Decoy Squad" is now implemented to ultimately take over their job after a trial run. This is how great this series is, you take a bunch of newbies and chuck them into an ongoing plot and all they do is ADD their talent in acting and screen presence to the table. Some interesting heat will come down on the decoy squad, as well as something terrible happening to Juliens former partner Tommy.  The corruption and mystery within the crime community runs deep, but doesn't ever lose us much. On the surface we still are able to keep up with the Strike team walking the line between good cop/bad cop, and gangs galore continue to wreak havoc in the streets. The drama and problems with EACH character continues to mount to the point you think it will crash before winning. Wrong again, these stories are tightly written and really do a good job to keep us intrigued because lets face it, like life, in the Shield you never know what is going to happen next.  The last few episodes are pretty intense. The strike team gets dissolved and Shane gets partnered up with a new guy named "Army" (he's an Iraq war veteran). Shane and Vic have a showdown of sorts, which really comes from all of the money issues and changed tactics involved in the money train. Season four will surprise you as well as please you, as it will see the roles of these 2 friends change quickly enough.  Season three starts off a little slow but considering the buildup to the ongoing storylines that are really turning into quite the dramatic and suspenseful mini-epics we hoped they would be, it's well worth the weight. Claudette and Dutch are still there cracking cases every day. Aceveda also appears to be going over the edge and it will be interesting to see if he can ever come back in the future 
 I fished this out of the cutout rack because of the radio song ('Trouble').  I had to listen to it a few times before it made sense.  But every year I like it better.  Alternatively weepy and acerbic, just about every track packs some kind of punch.  Wouldn't Paul McCartney have loved to have written 'Shadow of the West'?  Buckingham played most of the parts and made ample but effective use of studio gimmickry.  And he's a genuine wizard of six string instruments.  Songs like 'Mary Lee Jones' and 'That's How We Do it in LA' are goofy and edgy at the same time.  I listened to his later records but didn't encounter quite the same creativity that led to this gem 
 A.S.Byatt's first collection of short stories bears all the characteristic hallmarks of her writing: fascination with literature, acute analysis of the life of the mind, and a richness of cultural allusions. The stories are sometimes demanding, and require a second read for a full understanding, but as a whole they possess an allure in their mood of somewhat melancholy introspection. The subjects are, for the most part, middle-aged women, frequently intellectual, examining the pattern of their lives and thought. The strongest story, 'Precipice-Encurled', is a brilliantly constructed tale of encircled lives that paves the way for Byatt's best-seller 'Possession'; 'The Dried Witch' and 'In the Air', meanwhile, centre respectively on an old Korean woman giving herself up to the practice of witchcraft, and a widow coping with fear of the imagination. There's a discussion of cultural clashes in 'Loss of Face', and, in the final title story, a fusion of autobiography and an explanation of the intentions of the collection.    I enjoyed these stories, although I would rate the later collection, 'The Matisse Stories', higher. That said, they are  atmospheric and rewarding, and a good introduction to a fascinating writer 
 One of the class novels for our 6th grade class is Esperanza Rising. After looking at the book and seeing all the Spanish words, I decided that I needed the tape. The kids loved it and it was a great success in the classroom 
 Beautifully written book.  I enjoyed it so much that I couldn't limit myself to just one chapter at a time.  I can't wait for her next book 
 I have 5 childern and do not get to read aloud the quanity of books I would like to, so we invest in audio.  They can be enjoyed time and time again.  My kids play the "Laura" books we own over and over. Great for long car trips or when layed up with illness too 
 A trusted friend sent me a copy of this new edition of The Other House, insisting that I'd enjoy it. It looked intriguing. I felt obligated to at least give it a try. I still trust the friend! I can't believe this is what  is known as a Classic. I thought they were all very boring. I couldn't wait  to get back to this plot and I'd never have thought it was written in the  uptight Victorian era. It's more like a movie special of the week or one of  the top ten best selling novels. Read it then recommend it and impress your  friends with your literary depth 
 Arguably BURR is Vidal's best novel, though several others are right up there (Washington DC, Julian, 1876, Kalki, Myra Breckenridge). BURR is the novel that got me interested in history and it's hard not to foam at the mouth (or keyboard) when recommending it. It's so funny, so wise and so lively. (I'll mention here that Washington DC, the second Vidal book I read after The City and the Pillar, is the book that introduced me -- at about age 16 -- to irony. Not '90s sarcasm, mind you but the light and deft stuff.)   Vidal is a bit under-rated as a storyteller. So often that word is associated with bad writers (like Harold Robbins or Jefferey Archer) or at least with less than wholey respectable ones (Maugham and King come to mind -- both worthy writers, I'd say). It seems to me that ever since  Dickens, or maybe even before him, storytelling has come to be regarded as a liability. There's no space or time here -- or any desire -- to dive into literary theory. Suffice it to say that Vidal's pacing and plotting are really sly and profound, not just in this book but in just about all of his fiction. If you aren't an idiot and enjoy vivid stories then read BURR 
 This little book is big on good advice. The author explores many different spiritual paths to express her points, but suceeds in making the book very non-denominational. A great choice for anyone who is looking to go a little deeper in their search for a potential mate 
 I'll be the first to admit that I don't usually listen to electronic music.  I often find the music cold and distant.   But I was in a music funk.  Sick of the 1400 songs on my iPod (who'd a thunk it?), I bought this album, my first CD purchase in almost a year.    To say this album is electronic would do it no justice.  Yes, it's electronic but it's also very organic.  Kale mixes break beats with tablas.  He uses synths AND sitars.  And the vocals are heartbreaking, like Indian opera.  Yes, on paper, it sounds very strange.   But the result is a truly beautiful album that is probably the most original record I've heard in years.  All I can say is pick up this album because it'll amaze you!   
 This is a perfect compliment to a wonderful movie.  It all fit so beautifully together that I relive the film each of the many times I listen to it.  The music of Alex Heffes is hauntingly simple and lingers in your head.  I would have given this a 5 without a doubt if the Damien Rice song had been included.  That was a major disappointment to me 
 Kim was the first person to teach me how to crochet correctly (you don't even want to know what I was doing before)! This book is the next best thing to having her with you in person. The photos are clear, the projects are fun and if you need a refresher course, you'll find everything you need to know. Love it 
 "The Transit of Venus" is an extraordinary piece of modern literature.  Hazzard has a special talent for combining words on a page.  This talent is truly and uniquely illustrated here.  Her similes and metaphors, her adjectives and adverbs, her incisive psychological look at the characters inner thought processes and pattern are all here beautifully put together.  In this wonderful novel, Hazzard follows the love life, non-love life, adultery and non-adultery to illustrate the depth of human emotion.  Using world traveling characters, the book takes place all over the world, but mostly in England and the United States.  Hazzard is at her finest in some of her descriptive narrative about people's appearances and the physical realities, both beautiful and ugly, in the world about her characters.  With painstaking excellence, the lives of the two girls are illustrated.  There marriages; various deceits and betrayals; various divorces and continuations, the pace and thoughts of the ladies' encounters and interactions are elucidated.  Hazzard makes these two ladies a huge metaphor for love and dislove.  And yet, her focus surely is on love.  The many forms it takes are sketched out by Hazzard like a Renoir.    The book is highly recommended for those looking to read great Modern Literature.  Hazzard starts to reach her peak in this book, and only exceeds it in her most recent novel, "The Great Fire."  Those who wish to understand just a little better the phases of women's changing emotional patterns would be most enlightened by this work. 
 The most comprehensive book available. It teaches you to read Japanese script, a cruial step no other book incorporates well. Two drawbacks: the occasional inclusion of new vocabulary without explanation, and the unavailability of the accompanying tapes. Fair warning, though -- it is a rigorous course, and one best done with a tutor -- and a classmate 
 What I liked best about this terrific book is that it was written by two women--world-class neuroscientist Candace Pert and her lifelong friend and writer, Nancy Marriott.  There is something very personable and easy in their telling of the adventure they embark upon to get a book written, and along the way, explore the frontier of science on emotions, healing and spirituality. I loved that they took me so intimately on their journey--it made all the difference in me understanding the science to see how it influenced their real-life relationships and growth.    Oh, and not to forget the part about the AIDS drug Dr. Pert is developing with her husband, and getting a first-hand view of the governmental politics and industry greed that prevent new drugs from making it to people.  I wept to hear about the suffering that continues in Africa while we wait for a shift in consciousness by the powers that be, toward an acceptance of newly designed drugs that work but may not make people rich. This book is a fun romp, a seething indictment, and a tale of personal growth and triumph.  What a great combo 
 This scope is one of the best Gen 1 units on the market. At 36 lines/mm, it has just about the best resolution. Most other units only have 24 lines/mm. The illuminator is bright (almost too bright), uniform, and has a crisp edge. It could be a bit larger, however, so that it would fill the field of view.  Note that if you remove the eyepiece or lens, (to put on the riflescope eyepiece or change the magnification) you will break the seal and the unit will no longer be waterproof.  Don't bother with the IR flashlight. It's output is actually less than the built-in illuminator and it is far from uniform. 
 I would say get this and don't even bother with the Greatest Hits album.  You don't need to have "Eternal Flame" or "Going Down to Liverpool".  I remember friends of mine seeing them live and RAVING about them.  And these guys were into metal!  Susanna Hoffs is ultra hot.  Between her looks and that sexy voice she is really special and she still looks amazing. This album has their 2 best songs- "Walking Down Your Street" and "If She Knew What She Wants" and their 2 biggest hits- "Walk Like An Egyptian" and "Manic Monday". Susanna Hoffs is really hot- did I say that yet 
 The fed, a private bank, arbitrates the fierce competition for political control of the money supply between the financial forces of the market and the spending of the government.  The capitalist designed the central bank because they wanted to lend money.  The expansion and contraction of the money supply is managed by the Fed giving the central bank power of the money supply, increase or decrease of employment, and shifts in the swing of the business cycle.  The logic of the capitalist is the maximize profits and this means always the preserving the value of accumulated wealth.  The primary purpose of the democratic liberal state is too ensuring liberty, equality, defense, and the economic welfare of its citizens. The capitalist distrust the government because they believe governments will seek a monopoly over the money.  However, both parties share the same goal, economic prosperity.    So, the two branches of power, Government and the Market receive money flowing through the control of the Fed: The first through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which links directly too the inner circle of bankers that control the money injecting into wall street and the second through the Treasury Secretary, the main ambassador to the government.  The treasure produces high-powered money is invested into US securities having the net affect of expanding the money supply.  The Fed is not immune from the market force, the Fed must steer the economy through the peaks and valleys of the business cycle and positions itself in a place of authority to maintain confidence in the currency.  The fed operates within a sphere of intelligence; autonomously functioning to safeguard the orderly functioning of the financial system, which provides the financial funding, too drive a market economy.     The Fed is an independent judge, responsible for governing the world's money supply, independent from both the market and government.  The fed only tangible asset with the market is credibility.  The Fed establishes credibility with the public through formidable public relations, economic research, quiet legislative lobbying, and the exploiting the public demoralization with partisan politics.  At the same time the Fed must persuade governments to accept market logic for the economy over the long run.  The Fed presides over an inner club of national financiers protecting and publicly admonishing them to temper quests for profit, at the expense of the public good.  The Fed influences market financial stability setting the bond market long-term interest rates.  Interest rates affect either tighten or loosen credit by cooling down or heating up economic growth.  Globalization has transferred money sovereignty too the central banks.  Democratic governments were not transferring more money sovereignty to the central banks voluntarily, it was stateless capital forces enabling global investors power too move money through foreign exchange currencies into the safest and most profitable place to put their money.  Robert Heibroner said, "the social formation of capitalism has succeeded in bringing into being a realm of capital seemingly beyond all political control".   The global capital suggested mobility and erupted into a torrent of Foreign exchange financial transactions increasing from $18 trillion per year too $250 trillion dollars per year.   International bank lending surged with loans increasing 44% of GDP of 24 countries of the OEAD between 1980-1991.  Central bankers were positioned between government ministers and global finance marketers fearing exposure and politically overburdening monetary policy.     U.S Security transactions in the 1980s swelled from 50% to 600% of GDP, Japan from 50 to 750% GDP, United Kingdom from 50% to 200%, and Germany from 10% to 50%.  In the 1980s, US deficits hit $100 billion and represented 3.5% of GNP.  Formerly developed nations couldn't attract foreign capital beyond 1-2 percent of GNP; at that point market forced induced voluntary economic adjustments. 1987, foreign investment soared from Japan with Japan's stock market topping 26,000; second, globalization created leverage corporate takeovers causing US stock prices to soar (a Tax introduced by the House Ways and Means committee would burst the bubble); third, the gap between the bond market and the stock market increased suggesting over speculation and foreign investment interest decline; fourth, the Japanese and European investors dumped $500 millions in orders to sell triggering automatic selling in portfolio insurance protections;   fifth, long term bond rates rose above 10 percent to 10.4 as a dollar sell off  was in progress.  Germany and Japan worried about inflation at home and started raising rates; at the same time US trade deficit reached $15.7 billion.  Japanese investors fleed the market dumping US bonds in attempt to get out of the dollar.  The Fed stepped in as the lender of last resort and injected high power money back into the financial system to restore confidence and the perception of stability.  Secondly, the Fed convinced the inner circle of bankers to "suspend the natural state of competition and desist from the paradoxical behavior of entrenchment".  The inner circle of banks started to examine customer credit and push money from their reserves back into the market.  The fed oversaw the operation and made sure the financial arteries were opened up preventing a complete collaspe of the market.  The seemed to learn how the lender of last resort work in practice.  Carnage was high with the lost of over a $1 trillion dollars, investors could not get money to cover their margins as investment houses called in their loans.  The bulk of the carnage resulted from the owners of the market insurance, pensions, and investment banks as automated trading system activated dumping massive amounts of stock producing seller ratios to 70 to 1 against buyers.  The Fed did not suspend trading and thought to whether the storm.   The most serious bottleneck was the intersection of the futures and options plumbing.  Futures plumbing had huge margin calls of $2.1 billion due to be paid to CME clearing house.  The margin payments exceeded that amount of money four designated Chicago banks had on hand.  Eventually the money was payed out. Goldman Sache release some $600 million to its institutional customers before receiving money from the clearing house.  Goldman, Shearson, and Morgan Stanley were facing loses in the hundreds of millions.  Speculation started that the option market clearing house might collaspe.  Certain banks started restricting credit lines, imposing new loan restrictions, and declined transfer of funds to customers until they receiving covering funds.  Buyers disappeared.  With the futures market pointing to lower prices institutions dumped all stock still capable of being traded.  The Fed did not want the market to shutdown fearing it would not be able to get it open again.  First options received a continental loan for $102 million but on Black Tuesday need $138 million; comptroller from continental became rigid about relaxing firewall limits; the market panicked on new of the comprollers rigidity.  The fed moved urgently to approve the loan for first option.  The panic fever broke. What did this prove? "It demonstrated that the federal safety net extends beyond banking and covers securities firms" said Kenneth McLean 
 I read this because i wanted to learn about Marcel Proust and couldn't sit down and read the momouth volumes 
 Augustine's _Confessions_ have really had no parallel in the history of biographical writing. This account of his life stands as one of the most beautifully written Latin texts ever. Augustine was a master of prose writing and even in translations his work comes very powerfully forth.  There are many of these translations around but the best so far, in my opinion, is Henry Chadwicks. This translation speaks to the comtemporary reader in a way that is unpretentious and readable.  The content of the book itself is masterfully done. This laying bare of one's soul before God achieves an unimaginable amount of self knowledge and self mastery. Augustine is able to capture the need to find meaning in his life.  The first part of the book is what is most interesting for the general reader since it deals with the biographical part of Augustine's life. The second part is more theological and philosophical in scope. It is readable but it takes more work to get at the meaning Augustine intended.  This book is great for those who are searching for the truth about themselves, if ultimately there is any. 
 Then she gets kidnapped by Jake, an inept bank robber with 200 $1 bills in his pocket from the robbery (inept in a way that only an Anne Tyler character could be), and off the two of them go to Florida to hunt up Jake's pregnant girlfriend. Charlotte is having the time of her life. She'd been about to leave her husband of forever-many years, and here she suddenly finds herself off on an adventure she never could have dreamed up in her wildest imaginings. Hard to believe a story that begins with a robbery and a kidnapping could end up as touching and poignant - but it does 
 Avatar is one of my favorite shows. I am so thrilled that it is on Amazon. At first, the episode I downloaded didn't work, but they fixed the bugs. I have it on my Creative Zen Vision:M and it looks great 
 Gagliardi has done it again- this book is absolutely indespensible for anyone in or considering the world of management. Sun Tsu's words are timeless; Gagliardi's interpretation and direction leave no room for doubt 
 This excellent book exposes the anti-democratic nature of the British and US ruling classes. It shows how for most of the last century they committed huge crimes in the name of anti-communism, doing far more evil deeds than their class enemies.   In the 1930s, they collaborated with the Nazis, building up their war machine so that Hitler could attack their enemy, the Soviet Union. The authors write, "It is an irony that in 1939, the only national leader willing to admit Jews was that great anti-Semite Joseph Stalin." Perhaps he was not so anti-Semitic then? And whose armies liberated Eastern Europe from Nazism? Whose armies stopped the Nazis' death camps from operating?  After the Second World War, MI6 funded the Vatican's Nazi-smuggling operation from 1945 to 1947. The US State Department took over the job in 1947. Since then, "every major White Russian war criminal had been on one NATO payroll or another. Even the few German administrators from the SS had been hired. They were, so it seemed, good anti-Communists." "almost the entire Nazi puppet government of White Russia, which included large portions of Ukraine and Russia, had been smuggled in and given American citizenship."   "Israeli intelligence had known about the White Russian Nazis for years and kept silent." The Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal worked for US intelligence. "In over thirty years he had never criticized American intelligence for hiring Nazis. During the same thirty years, Soviet propaganda had frequently denounced Wiesenthal as an agent of Western intelligence, accusing him of hunting only those Nazis who were not on NATO's payroll." So the Soviet propaganda was telling the truth; the Western agencies who denounced the Soviets for lying were the real liars.  The crimes continued into the 1980s. Thatcher sent aid, including arms, to Nicaragua's terrorists, the Contras. The Thatcher and Reagan governments secretly ran arms to Iran in 1984.   The authors conclude, "For the really dirty tricks, heavy-duty arms deals, and outrageously illegal covert operations, the Americans turn to Britain, not to Israel. The British government has the most repressive combination of libel laws, press censorship, and criminal sanctions against disclosing intelligence operations of any country in the democratic world. It knows how to keep a secret from its own press, public, and Parliament. More important, it knows how to shift the blame to others when an operation is exposed."  
 Thanks for the prompt, accurate delivery of this product 
 What a beautifully written book about death and the dying process.  I only wish that I had been able to read this and so many more like it when my beloved mother was going through the dying process. I would have been able to understand so much better just what she was trying to communicate to me. One never knows when death will come or how it will come to us.  Hopefully, we will be prepared to deal with it long before its' arrival as well during the actual dying process. If readers enjoy this book, they will surely love "Grant Me My Final Wish:  A personal journal to simplify life's inevitable journey." This beautifully done book by Renata Vestevich allows us to begin preparing for that inevitable day right now while we are still able to communicate.  If you find it difficult to verbalize your final wishes, then this diary/journal will allow you to do just that.  Not only does it allow you to step-by-step communicate your final wishes, it is a beautiful place to store your precious written as well as photographic memories.  These two authors have allowed us to be well prepared for that final journey.  I cannot thank them enough! 
 This might be the most thorough introduction to the study of family crests and medieval coats of arms readily available today. It clearly explains the origin and meaning of dozens of symbols and emblems. The best part is that it includes lots of photos and illustrations (including several color plates)which are invaluable in trying to trace one's heritage.  
 I found the science riveting, and a real revelation that finally showed me that ourbrains, are not "ourselves" and are not "CEOs of our body", but brain/body is one big complex system.  The insight into the dirty world of science itself also interesting.    Pert, I think gives away more than she intends, when describing her actions: she seems to be an "alpha" character herself, using sexual tension to get what she wants in the laboratory (later in the book this approach is described as a supposedly empowering trait, after she has dumped her husband), she only ever refers to her children as an impediment to her career (because of male scientist's attitudes), and she doesn't acknowledge her own ruthlessness early in her career, but rather points at the one supervisor who was arguably worse than her as a symbol of male aggression.  There is also a long-winded justification of how she co-erced a fellow scientist to dropping his research secrecy, causing him to lose publication to a rival (her own lab, I think I remember, could be wrong).    Life's not always the simple "me against the world" story authors would prefer to see it as.  Still a great read 
 This book helped me understand a lot of the reasons for my intense social anxiety.  Of course, working through the anxiety with a professional Christian counselor was the biggest help for me personally, but this book was a great addition to the therapeutic process.  The book offers great spiritual insight into the agony of anxiety 
 Reading Vollmann is like bumping into your girlfriend's mother as you exit the adult book store with a brown bag full of porn tucked under your arm.  It's the shame of having secrets brought out into the light of day for others to gawk at,   the shock of recognition,  the pain that accomanpies knowledge.  It's like being stared at...

 WE REMEMBER THE HOLOCAUST IS A GOOD BOOK BECAUSE IT FIRST HAND HISTORY. FIRST OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS BOOK LIVED THROUGH HELL. I FELT LIKE I WAS THERE. THIS IS THE BEST BOOK BECAUSE THE PEOPLE TELLING IT LIVED THROUG IT 
      This is a remarkable and thought-provoking volume. Prof. Packer develops the view that there is an antinomy between human responsibility and the sovereignty of God. These understandings do not contradict each other and in fact exist alongside each other. We need to hold both ideas in our minds as we consider Holy Scripture and reflect on the truths of God's reality.      The work also discusses evangelism in light of this "double" understanding. The sovereignty of God in no way detracts from the need for evangelism. In fact, he makes a beautiful point in noting that were in not for God's sovereignty (and limited atonement) our evangelistic efforts would always fail. No one would come to God if it were just up to the evangelist's human zeal to win souls. A heavenly intervention is needed for souls to be saved. Because we know that Almighty God through His Son Jesus Christ is effectually calling souls to Him, we can have no crisis of doubt that our efforts are in vain.      While he does not wish to discount the modern semi-Pelagian or Pelagian approach to evangelism as being totally unworthy, at the same time, he is clearly pointing to the reformed understanding as the better of the two evangelistic understandings. Thus, I would have wished for a little less diplomatic language when expositing the two views of evangelism. He clearly does not like evangelistic services that pump up people to answer an altar call or charismatic approaches that are even more emotional, even feverish. Yet, he doesn't come out and say so. I wish he had.     Also, I very much doubt if most readers will be able to hold the ideas of God's sovereignty and unconditional election in their minds alongside the equally true and cogent thought of moral responsibility. Ultimately, one side of the antinomy or the other will be weighted more heavily. Yet, at the theoretical or conceptual level, Prof. Packer's attempt is true and even noble.     His reticence notwithstanding the book is a marvelous reflection on the issues of responsibility, God's sovereignty, and the need for evangelism. I recommend that all Christians read it, and believe everyone will be wiser for the time spent 
 All the reviews here are pretty cool. I picked up this book and it has lots of info in different areas (7 pillars) I want to re-read it and have already put into practice some of it and want to even more.  For a Christian / health book it is a blessing.  recommended for sure. 
 Latino CEOs and executives reveal career secrets that helped them overcome obstacles.  The book is available in Spanish with the title Exito Latino. My public library catalog decribes it this way: "The candid, inspiring stories in this book reveal the secrets that have helped Latinos make it to the top in a variety of businesses and industries. Readers will discover how to manage people, prepare and set goals, and deal with racism or sexism in the workplace."  
 It was very detailed about the early history of Australia's settlement colonies including in Norfolk Island, Van Dieman's Land(Tasmania) and New South Wales.  It described famous stories of cannabalism, the relationship to the aborigines, the brutality of the penal settlements and the conditions in Ireland and Great Britain that caused the convicts to be shipped half way around the globe 
 This movie is based on the first three books in the series of thirteen very short volumes.  A lot of people, who apparrently hadn't read the book(s) say Jim Carey basically played himself in the movie, but this couldn't be further from the truth--he played the part perfectly.  I'm not a big Jim Carey fan, but think he does get a bad rap for no apparrent reason.  The last big criticism of him was for Cable Guy--in which he actually played a serious role.  I suppose Cable Guy was a comedy, but it was a 'black comedy' and this movie is much the same.   Sure this movie (and the written story) is funny, but it's also in that Harry Potter (or Peter Pan, or Alice in Wonderland, or The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, or many other much greater and confirmed classic 'children's stories') stream of being a good story for children that's not the traditional 'happily ever after.'  It wont give your kids nightmares or bruise their fragile sensibilities, but it might fire a few more brain cells than other childrens stories which strain themselves not to cross those lines parents draw  in our V-chip American society.    Put more frankly, your kids wont turn into serial killers because they watched or read something that wasn't completely innocent, puritanical, or childish.  Bottom Line: Because the movie really turned me onto the books, I'm glad I saw it.  I also think this is a great performance by Jim Carey, from whom we normally expect only silliness. 
 Ruth Beechick is an excellent writer.  She has the insights of an academic in this book (as well as others), but is capable of writing to the young student as well as the adult.  Highly recommended for unit study on ancient history or Bible study.  Also a beautiful book, full of color photographs/graphics/fine art, and it is laid out well for the teacher 
 This book is excellent,educational,and shocking! He really proves UFOs are real but what are they? Do yourself a favor and read this book.It is not a religious book.,but a in depth serious look into UFOs and,all that comes with that quest for their elusive secret mystery! Most of all Gary Bates gives you hundreds of sources for all information and facts.So read it and then go check every word for the truth yourself.I did and he is correct.Gary Bates reaches into your very soul., revealing shocking truths about the cosmos,alien life,and just how easy it is to become a casualty of a insidious cosmic war that has been raging on for centuries!  
 This book is in its fourth printing for a reason: It is a classic.  Not the sort that sits on a shelf to be shown off, but the sort that is studied like a college textbook.    Undoubtedly, Freya Aswynn has made the runes her life's work, which is what makes her books stand-alone.  This reviewer owns seven rune books, only two are ever referenced: `Northern Mysteries and Magick', and Aswynn's first book: `Leaves of Yggdrasil'.  Anyone can write a book on the runes, and obviously many do, but there are very few who work from the position that Aswynn does, and that is lifelong experience and dedication.  Her loudest critics are those that cite the Rune Poems as the gospel of all runic information.  Even a cursory glance at the runes will confirm that they are not static, and that the Rune Poems are merely a starting point - far from a definitive guide.  Freya's work takes the reader into realms unexplored, into unknown and exciting territory, something that makes many people very uncomfortable.  But for those who embrace a challenge, who enjoy thinking outside of the norm, and who are tired of reading the same runic information rehashed, this book is for you.  I recently read another book that has done the same thing, one that asks the reader to remove themselves from rigid perspectives and tedious patterns, that book was `Vlusp - Seir as Wyrd Consciousness'.   If Asatru is to lift itself from the quagmire that keeps it misidentified to Wicca and other New Age practices, then it must explore its most profound depths from the inside, instead of having them determined by those who view it only as history instead of the vibrant folk faith it is.    
 One would think, judging from the negative reviews here, that this book was a hatchet job on its subject: the individuals who have promulgated the philosophy (and ideology) of Traditionalism in the 20th and 21st centuries. The book didn't read as that to me. Rather, it struck me as a reasonably detached, thoroughly engaging history of an influential esoteric movement whose participants have previously remained opaque and cipher-like to the world at large.   But more than that, it is a bracing antidote to the lionizing of Guenon and Schuon (and others) by their followers. Do the Traditionalists have perspectives worth considering? Certainly, and they've influenced my own outlook considerably. But Traditionalism also comes with a lot of baggage (ranging from Guenon's "mild paranoia" as Sedgwick puts it, to Schuon's near deification by his cultish inner circle). _Against the Modern World_ includes that baggage as part of the bigger picture and this is of great benefit for the reader.  If you've ever read any of the Traditionalists' works, you owe it to yourself to read this book in order to gain a sense of the context in which those works arose.   (Despite some typos and minor errors in the book, I give it 5 stars in recognition of its significance in the fields of esoteric, spiritual, and religious studies. The book is not perfect, but it is extremely valuable.) 
 I LOVE this video.  The girls have rock solid bodies and their moves range from beginner to really hard.  I drip sweat continually with some of the routines.  Read some of the other reviews to get an in depth feel for the video/DVD.  I recommend this for anyone wanting to really target their abs and butt/legs.  It only has two segments for arms and they are mediocre, I thought.  But I love being able to choose 10 minute segments.  I always start by telling myself I'll just do one and inevitably I do two or three.  I don't think I'll get bored with this one, since it has so many variables.  Highly recommend 
 The Rivers of War (2005) is the first novel in an Alternate History series about the American Frontier.  In 1814, Andrew Jackson attacked the Northern Creeks fortification at Horseshoe Bend;  the first man over the wall was Ensign Sam Houston.  A few months later, Winfield Scott led his brigade of outnumbered regulars against British veterans south of the Chippewa River bridge;  the British were defeated, but retreated in good order.  Later, Admiral Cochburn invaded Washington and burned the White House.  In this novel, Sam Houston receives only a minor flesh wound in the Battle of the Horseshoe.  He becomes a protege of General Jackson and privy to his intentions.  Reaching an understanding with Jackson, Sam discusses the situation with The Ridge, an influential Cherokee chief, and other Cherokees.  At the suggestion of Jackson, Captain Houston and Lieutenant John Ross take a party of Cherokees to Washington to discuss American policies toward the Southeastern indian tribes with Secretary of State Monroe.  The group also includes the children and nephew of Major Ridge;  Sam is charged with finding them suitable schooling.  Tiana Rogers goes along just because she wants to.  Lieutenant Patrick Driscoll has also come to Washington to recover from his wounds.  A former master sergeant, Driscoll finally accepted a commission after loosing his left arm above the elbow at the Battle of Chippewa.  He is accompanied by Private Anthony McParland, a former deserter from the US Army who learned the error of his ways after an abortive execution.  Houston and Driscoll both witness the invasion of Washington by the British and they resolve to defend the city.  Each starts gathering "the shattered fragments of disparate units" as US forces retreat toward Georgetown.  Although Houston initially decides to protect the President's house, Driscoll persuades him to take these men and weapons to the Capitol Building, which is much better constructed and situated.  There they build makeshift ramparts for their few artillery pieces, station men in the windows facing east, and await the British.  The beginnings of this novel are real history, although in the manner of Herodotus and other ancient Greeks.  That is, the true events are reported insofar as possible, but dialogues are manufactured for each participant, using such quotes as are available.  The alternate history begins with the wounding of Sam Houston as he goes over the wall at Horseshoe Bend;  the wound was actually much more disabling than described herein.    The author takes a few historical characters and puts them in a position to defend the Capitol Building, if not the whole city.  He shows what General Winder could have done if he had not panicked.  Of course, the author used one of the most charismatic and stable of the young officers of that time to lead the defenders and also created the perfect noncom to advise him.  If Houston had been able to be there, with a suitable advisor, he may well have acted as the story suggests.  The firing squad incident really occurred, thus Driscoll and McParland are based on historical personages.  Yet the names of these individuals were not recorded and little is known of them.  So their subsequent actions in this novel are imaginary.  But Scots, Irish and Scot-Irish have been coming to the new world since the time of Queen Mary and this trickle became a flood after the American revolution.  Many were veterans of European wars of those centuries, including the Napoleonic Wars.  So Driscoll is based on the military archetype of the Celtic noncommissioned officer.  Many other characters in this novel were historic personages, including the American statesmen, the American senior officers, and the British commanders.  All the Cherokees and other indians named in this work were factual.  So was Marie Laveau, voudou queen of New Orleans.  The intent of this series is to present a feasible alternative to the Trail of Tears.  Although not resolved in this novel, Houston proposes the idea of a voluntary mass relocation of the Cherokees across the Mississippi, such as advocated and demonstrated by Chief Tahlonteskee.  Jackson agrees to concentrate on removing the Spanish from Florida to allow sufficient time for Houston to develop support for this plan among the various clans.  Monroe even promises some material and financial aid for the relocation.  Highly recommended for Flint fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of history being remade.  -Arthur W. Jordin 
 Anything about Embedded Software from Colin Walls, really got something special in it. Embedded Software is becoming larger and larger as the number of gadgets become more and more sophisticated. Therefore a comprehensive book both for a newbie and for a seasoned professional is a need of the day. I would say that it covers ALL the essentials for embedded software ranging from Programming in C/C++ to RTOS and Networking. For every Embedded Software Developer out there and even for a newbie, this book is definitely a must have 
 "Wanted Dread & Alive," Peter Tosh's final album for the Rolling Stones' label, was released in 1981 in the aftermath of the death of Tosh's former bandmate, Bob Marley.  With that event, mystique and intrigue surrounded Tosh's new album with its prevocative, enigmatic music.  Equally enticing is the addition of several tracks not on the U.S. album, "Rok With Me," "Oh Bumbo Klaat," and "Guide Me From My Friends," as well as two previously unreleased alternate versions of "Rok With Me," and the duet with Gwen Guthrie "Nothing But Love".  The opening track, "Coming In Hot," is a purposely violent depiction of Tosh's personal bout with a heavy fever at the beginning of the year, although some thought this was a song in answer to Bob Marley's "Coming In From the Cold".  The other track tied to Marley was the soothing, beautiful "Fools Die (For Want of Wisdom)," originally entitled "Wisdom," when it was made with Bunny Wailer and Bob Marley years before.  The reason for the connection is that both Marley and Tosh had made covers of this old song, and the lyrics in Tosh's "Fools Die (For Want of Wisdom)," were seen as tied to Bob Marley's cover, "Stiff Necked Fools".  Here, Tosh does give slight exposure to a fun side with the danceable, fun song "Reggaemylitis," reffering to a disease only reggae can cure.  Also here to show Tosh's fun side are the R&B-style songs "Nothing But Love," and "Rok With Me," the first being a smash-hit duet with Gwen Guthrie.  Of course, his classic millitancy, anger, and spirituallity do out-shine the other moods, with songs like the title track, "Wanted Dread and Alive," my personal favorite, the solemn, dark "Guide Me From My Friends," the addition to the previous song entitled "That's What They Will Do," and finally "Cold Blood," a song resembling Tosh's 1971 "Here Comes the Judge," although this recording was in reference his bogus 1978 ganja possession charge.  While each of the above songs do have strong elements of spirituality, this is the main theme for powerful, yet relaxing and meditative songs like "Rastafari Is," the aforementioned "Fools Die (For Want of Wisdom)," and the ambitious, truthful "Oh Bumbo Klaat," which was about Tosh's battle with demons that would plague him constantly.  Usually seen as an obscenity, Tosh views the term "Bumbo Klaat," as a way to drive away evil spirits as he states in the song.  Finally, there are the two previously unreleased extended mixes of two tracks, both wonderful and original remixes.  This album contains some of Peter Tosh's finest work and is without a doubt, one of the most legendary works of art in his career.  It is, indeed, a milestone for the ages 
 Excellent text book. The CD-Rom guide book gives you the extra help needed to excel in the course. The topic finder is also a great tool 
 Ella of Frell (Anne Hathaway) is an unusual child.  As a baby, a bumbling fairy godmother named Lucinda (Vivica A. Fox) gave her the gift of obedience.  Every time anyone gives her a direct command, she must obey.  Despite, or maybe because of, this "gift," Ella grows to be a headstrong woman.  She goes against the conventional wisdom of the realm when it comes to ogres, giants, and elves.  Current rules state that these creatures are dangerous and must perform certain jobs only.  But Ella campaigns for their equality.  She is also one of the few women in the realm who doesn't swoon at the site of Prince Char (Hugh Dancy).  When the two meet accidentally, Char finds this distain quite refreshing and immediately begins to fall for the headstrong young woman.  Trouble is brewing at home, however.  Ella's stepsister Hattie (Lucy Punch) has figured out Ella's secret.  Now, Ella finds herself doing things she would never willing do.  So she leaves home and sets out to find Lucinda to give the gift back.  I had missed seeing this movie in the theater, and finally got a chance to watch it.  I missed a real treat.  The movie is funny from start to finish, and I had a grin on my face the entire time.  While the story is a bit predictable, it isn't super preachy.  The cast does an amazing job bring their characters to life.  The only drawback to the movie is the special effects.  While some worked well, most of the time they weren't up to today's standards.  While the main audience might be teen girls, this is one adult male who loved it.  It's sweet, charming, and entertaining.  What more could you want 
 The book is a compendium of experiences in the life and times of Abraham Lincoln. The author depicts him as a strong self-educated character who studied Kirkham's Grammar, philosophy, astronomy, chemistry, engineering surveys and the law. He studied military science so that he could debate the generals of the time. There is much detail on the early life of Lincoln. This aspect makes the book interesting because many of the facts related are not well known to the general public.  Lincoln was a "Universalist" who shied away from religious arguments in favor of moral ones. The former President secured the 1860 nomination against strong rivals including Seward. Seward was ahead at the Republican Convention; however, he was thought to be more radical than Lincoln on the subject of slavery.  Lincoln considered slavery a monstrous injustice. Frederick Douglass was always at ease while in the presence of Abraham Lincoln. The former president acted courageously to deal forthrightly with the issue of slavery instead of leaving the issue for future generations to correct.  The book contains much historical information which will be of interest to a wide constituency of academicians. It is a must read for every American interested in the pre-Civil War era 
 I read this book after A Fine Balance. Although I found A Fine Balance to be the most moving and brilliantly contructed novel I have ever read, I preferred this book as it didn't tear me apart emotionally as much as AFB. I adored the characters and was touched by the protagonist's kindness towards Tehmul when he (SPOILER) discovers the whereabouts of the doll. If I have any criticism at all, I felt that the so-called "plot" of the book (according to its cover), i.e. the conflict between father and son, was underplayed. I would assume this is more to do with the publisher's blurb than Mr. Mistry's storytelling. A compelling, touching read that I was sorry to finish.. 
 This book started a little slow but once it got into the action, I could not put it down. Ruby was a soldier who stood by her man all the way to the end! The book told the story of how one man Prince took over the city. This book did not hold anything back! I love Donald Goines books because you don't know what to expect but reality. THIS IS A MUST READ 
 The Cold War Swap is the first in a long series of excellent mystery/thrillers by Ross Thomas.  Thomas's first novel was written during his career as a newsman and public relations expert in many parts of the world.  As with all first novels there are a few holes - the one that sticks out most in my mind is the biographical anomaly of main character Michael Padillo - alleged to have been born in 1926 - who after a variegated upbringing by his multi-lingual mother, enters the US Army and "in late 1942 was happily running the bar of an officers' club..."  As a veteran myself I found it extremely unlikely that a 16 year old kid would be "running" anything in the US Army.  Padillo gets picked for undercover work after someone "browsing through his records" learns that he can speak and write six languages.  I'm kind of surprised they didn't discover that he was underage for enlistment at the same time.. In any case the novel is extemely well-written, with sharply defined characters in a classic 50's-60's Cold War "us against them" espionage story.  Most of the characters are neither wholly good nor completely evil, and you have some fun trying to figure out which way some of them might bounce.  A very satisfying read, well worth checking out from your library if available - a good introduction to the shadowy and shady worlds of money, politics, espionage and government about which Ross Thomas wrote so well during his writing career 
 As an emotional freedom coach, I find that many clients have anxiety and worry around money and success. Inside, they know they have not reached their potential for financial abundance. They have resistance, fears, guilt, past failures, inner conflicts, and limiting beliefs about money that block their ability to use the law of attraction to allow well-being to flow into their lives. I recommend this book to my clients, and we often tap together using EFT on the specific memories Carol's abundance tapping exercises and games bring up.   Let me share with you a few specific stories of how I've used this book. One client is a new mother, her second child. She and her husband really needed money. Their car was broken down. They were tense and worried. I had her do just one of the games, the Cash Comfort game where she held a $100 bill in her hand, noticed the feelings it brought up, and tapped on the sequence of points while staring at the bill and holding it. There is more to the game, but the key point for this client is that after the game, she felt calm and hopeful. She did their taxes, which she had dreaded. And it turned out they were owed $1500 in a tax refund. Naturally, they would have eventually done their taxes and received the refund. Those of us who work with Carol's Attracting Abundance with EFT materials, though, see this kind of "surprise" happen for MANY people when they let go of even SOME of their fear and worry.   Another client was obsessing about his financial situation... and some would say with good reason. It was keeping him from sleeping and his negative, hopeless thoughts were leaving him with no energy to take proactive action. He tapped through the entire book and the exercises. And he continued to tap for 20 minutes every day using the book as his guide. His energy improved and his faith started to return. At the end of 30 days, his mental clarity and level of positive action towards turning around his financial situation were dramatically better. No miracle fortune arrived, but he also didn't lose the house and the car. We know from the Law of Attraction that first we must shift our vibration into one that attracts and allows the flow of abundance. This client's persistent action not only has helped him engage in a new business venture, it also has restored much of his hope and confidence (and when he needs a boost, he has a tool he can use for emotional self-care). I've found that when we are surrounded by negative circumstances, daily tapping with EFT using a series of well-crafted steps like these in Attracting Abundance with EFT is like taking a "shower" to wash off the "dirt." It feels so much better when we're done!   My last story observes the effect of this book on someone who was already successful. This client has a growing practice in the health arena. People who know him consider him positive, upbeat, and confident. All true! Yet, his business had hit a ceiling, and he knew his own limiting beliefs were keeping him from breaking through to a new level. We used EFT to tap on specific issues, and I sold him a copy of the book. After going through it once, he continues to tap on an exercise or two EVERY DAY. The results he credits to the book and EFT include:   - Changing his confidence level with other professionals; he's networking far more and building collaborative and profitable partnerships.  - He signed an agreement with his risk-adverse partner so he can take risks (and benefit from the upside) while providing the security the partner demanded; he stepped up as the leader rather than staying within his previous Comfort Zones.  - His vibration changed around his location, and a new location is opening up that will mean far more visibility.  - His business is generating more cash than at any previous time; his employees are going to be getting a nice bonus.   To me what this book does is help activate ALL that I already know about business. Clearing the blocks to success & abundance, increasing prosperity consciousness, activating the Law of Attraction, and claiming abundance now... these are the four simple steps covered in this book. Carol makes it fun. This book makes it easy.  
 I checked this book out at the library and have learned many things.  I am a beginner and it is nice to have such a large reference book at hand.  The book divides patterns up by "weight" which is helpful.  I'll be getting a copy as a gift.  
 "Chrome" was voted by at least one big name British rag as among the best guitar albums of all time. They've got it right. With a sound that's equal parts bombast and aggression, British and nationless, and heavy by virtue of just how soaked with effects the guitars are, Catherine Wheel blossoms out of speakers.  The sonics aren't too different from "Ferment," the band's first album, but the production is stronger, louder, and better mixed, giving even more room for Futter's lead guitar storm to rain down. Dickinson's voice is one of the most distinctive ever in rock music and perfectly suited to the kind of music this band created: spacey and bordering on angelic, but with an edge.  Sudden musical shifts from meandering melodic to flat-out rocking ("I Confess"), vivid synesthetic properties ("Broken Head"'s soaring chorus honestly creates a visual of some kind of life essence escaping from someone's skull), and an overall love for crafting multi-layered guitar music are put on display here.  Few bands can write something as convincingly vintage and poppy as "Show Me Mary" (with very modern effects and production) and put it on the same album with epic guitar feasts like "Pain" and "Ursa Major Space Station."  As far as androgynously poppy fuzzpop albums to come out in the early '90s go, "Chrome" is the best, topping "Loveless" by virtue of its lack of cheesy drum machine dance rhythms and inclusion of blues-inspired guitar noise 
 The paperback version of "The Rift" weighs in at 932 pages, and the earthquake doesn't begin until page 172.  Even though I kept waiting for the earthquake and anticipating it for 171 pages, I enjoyed the character development in these pages and thought the buildup, while excessive, was worth my time. Nevertheless, I think Mr. Williams' editors should have insisted on cutting story lines.  [spoiler ahead] For example, Charlie's (the commodities trader) storyline went nowhere. I understand that Mr. Williams wanted to show us what happens to someone who just can't wrap his head around a disaster of this scale. It was instructive, perhaps, but did not advance the overall story and didn't connect in any way. Likewise, the St. Louis Arch story line could have been completely redacted. It was interesting in its own, but served only to bulk up the otherwise lengthy book and slow down the story. What happened to our likeable, heroic, and interesting park ranger? Where'd she go? Did she survive? We'll never know. Although the character of the President of the United States was well-written and interesting, he was also extraneous and served to slow down the action. [end spoilers]  Williams introduced each section with an account of the great New Madrid quake of 1911. About halfway through, I started skipping these accounts. They just bogged down the story and most of them weren't relevant or helpful.   Despite the book's shortcomings, the main "Nick/Jason" storyline is skilllfully paced, compelling and interesting. The pre-millennialist preacher and the kluxer sheriff story lines fold in nicely and create enormous suspense. General Frazetta is a delight. Williams' antagonists are multi-faceted - one can sympathize with most of them even though they are vile.   There are a couple of enormously surprising moments, which are well worth the prolix. I highly recommend this epic, despite its shortcomings 
 Jacks Dr Sax represents his thoughts,feelings and fantasies throughout his early years in Lowell. Masterfully told through pre-birth, present tense and future tense, Dr Sax weaves a tangled web of delight to those who take the plunge into the River called Kerouac. The chapter "The Night The Man With The Watermelon Died" is worth the price of admission alone. Thank God for Kerouac a good companion throughout lifes troubled waters 
 This Cd is used in the bedroom to help relax and fall asleep. It is a pleasant 'white noise' that can be looped all night if so desired. An excellant and inexpensive investment in serenity that could be used for studying or meditation as well 
 A very good movie. The directors cut has some nice extra features that are a must for the Last of the Mohicans fans. Highly recommende 
 This is a great book especialy if you are interested in history or the Kennedys.  Even if you aren't it is still a great book. It keeps your intrest and does not bore you with things you don't want to read about. I strongly recommend reading it 
 Great timetable illustrated by detailed maps and explanations from the Ottoman Empire split-up to today,  Colorful maps 
 Excuse the pun, but the pearls of wisdom afforded by this tome were of princely sum to this seafood professional 
 I think this book is a great way of for young people to understand how life was for a black men. I never really thought about the white  mainstream until I read this book. I can just imagine just how hard it must have been. I know that I would get pissed off if I applied to a job and got rejected, and then the next day I see the same person who applied to same job and got it. I would also assume it was becasue of my color. Especially if it happend back then.   McCall talks about his life in his younger years and the things he did which include rape, robbery, and shootings. I'm glad that he changed his way of life while in prison and after. It was good of him to recognize that the things he did when he was younger were wrong. He told the story of his life and he kept it real.   I would definitly encourage people to read this book. Especially young people like me. It really shows you that you can do whatever you want if you set your mind into it. This book truly represents the quote "Life is what you make it." I would also like to point out that McCall may come of as if he hates white people, but I think thats is because of all the racist remarks he got. But he does get to know a few towards the end of the book.  
      Fannie Flagg's debut novel is written in a diary-like fashion from the pen of one Daisy Faye Harper, who chronicles her life from the age of 11 to 18.  She lives in a small town in Mississippi with her alcoholic father and her neurotic mother.  Despite his flaws, Daisy Faye's father inspires a passionate love and loyalty in her and she is always ready to go along with him in the wildest of schemes.  Whether he's trying to win a fishing contest with a frozen fish or work a money-making miracle by pretending his daughter has risen from the dead, Daddy Harper always has Daisy Faye as his sidekick.  One minute Daisy Faye has the reader laughing over an hilarious new character or sitation, and the next minute she brings on the tears with her matter-of-fact recital of the latest shenanigans of her dysfunctional family.  No matter what chaos is going on around her, Daisy Faye always seems to maintain her composure and sail through the situation unscathed.  She is the center around which the other characters move.  Her stream-of-consciousness narrations are at once hilarious and yet profound as she shows what it was like growing up in a dysfunctional household in the South during the 50's.      
 Kudos to Lawrence Block for creating a witty series in the burglar mysteries, and a special kudo for this entry -- the best of the bunch (so far).  The characters are appealing, the dialog is pithy, and the plot is intriguing.  As usual, burglary is mixed in with murder, and our hero must find the killer to clear his own name.  I loved the way Bernie confronts the suspects in the dramatic scene in the apartment.  Such an intellect hasn't seen the pages of fiction since Nero Wolfe.  I highly recommend this well written book.  I suspect Mr Block would make for a most interesting dinner party 
 Yes this is "worth it".   I took my younger brother to three movies in our teens, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter and Spinal Tap. Being an older sis I can forget the near death face he wore after the first two(of course he'll never forget it) but the utter outrage of his 14 year old Zeppelin playing, Doors 24/7-loving self displayed after Tap...ah that I recall ever after. (Usually to any girlfriend that comes around). He took it all to be actual documentary, no Mockumentary concept for Ken, and while I laughed myself into the aisles with jokes I still love...he was incenced. "What the hell kind of band is that?"...he was livid. Okay you had to be there but the only thing funnier than this movie is watching it with someone who is so rockraged they are arching off the walls. So seeing this  lovely "special edition" off it went this July as his present for his 42nd birthday. "Very damn funny" was my greeting. It's a terrific present with added stuff to bring a few more laughs. Admittedly nothing tops the Stonehenge dance of the dwarves..but it's just all fun. And more fun. If I could haul this in and show it as the first of the year teacher luncheon entertainment I could watch my brother's routine all over again with most of the staff i work with just living in "what is this " land...ah that would be supremely satisfying.

 This book is without a doubt the best german shepherd dog book on the market today.  It has a little something for everybody in it.  History, training tips, pictures, its got it all. I especially like her inclusion of German dog show information. If there is anything that you need to know about this  breed, it is definately in this book 
 Sometimes you need to get back at those polysyllabalistic professors. This book will help you do that without having to abrade your cranium 
 While Nuala and Dermott are still interesting, the story about Nora and Ned is even better.  This one is hard to put down.  I think it's time that Nuala and Fr. Blackie team up in a mystery in Chicago.   Thanks to Fr. Greeley for another wonderful read 
 As some of the others have said (or over-stated), it may not be the best Bluegrass documentary out there....but it is really good, especially for novices.    However, the best part of the DVD is the imagery and film footage.  If you get nothing else, its an amazing visual history lesson of the tmes. 
 This is basic,stripped to the bone rock & roll, as only John Fogerty can do it. Here we are back in "Creedence  territorium".  Few misteps in cliche country doesnt give this a five star, anyway it`s a quality product all trough. John Fogerty has a rough voice, soulfoul and very intense sometimes. It fit`s very well into the music that also has that simplicty to it, but here simplicty  a quality mark  stamped all over the CD. The CD is called Blue Moon Swamp, and if you close your eyes, it`s easy to get that cajun feel, mysterious and very likeable, with guitar`s as the main instrument on most of tracks. He has total control over this production, written, arranged, and produced by John Fogerty. After the mistep with the CD Eye of The Zoombie it`s good to have John Fogerty back in the big league when it comes to quality. Where lies the magic with John Fogerty ? It`s difficult to say, but when you listen to the most "boring" track like the CD Track 5. Rattlesnake Higway, it still has the "magic touch" inbetween, the fuzz and rumble that this song has sometimes, which destroying the total listning experience. But, hey we are soon back in buisness again with the Track 6 Bring it down to Jelly Roll, which "swing along" as a great tune. John Fogerty knows his roots, as he writes on track 9 Rambunctinous boy:  "well i ain`t good looking and i ain`t so smart  but baby im a sensitive guy. I ain`t done everything there is to do,but ill damn sure give it a try"  Much good lifewisdoom there or  what  
 I was led to this book through the author's sister, Poe.  Being someone who knows the difference between semantics and semiotics, I figured this looked like an interesting book to pick up.  I'm glad that I did.  It is a great mix of pop culture, intelligence, sex, angst, and a great story in a world so detailed that it must be real.  At times, it is a play within a play within a play and sometimes you're not quite sure how many layers there are.  The layout of the book itself is also amazing. I am only giving it 4 stars because it does drag a bit at parts, but that is a bit of the charm of it.  I could also be influenced by the fact that my reading of it was a bit broken up into chunks so I was anxious for important things to happen anytime I picked it up 
 Not being very well educated in art, the book helped me better understand some of what Picasso was trying to portray in his artwork. It is an easy book to get through once you get into it, the way it is written it can be long and tedious at times but the information Francoise Gilot gives is quite sincere and in depth. The book will give you a better incite to Picasso's twisted and passionate life, leaving you with a newfound knowledge and idea about Picasso 
 Feinstein has made his mark as a "behind the scenes" writer/reporter and the result has been a number of noteable successes, but "Next Man Up" is certainly his most outstanding and revealing work.  At first glance, I too, asked "The RAVENS?" but the fact is, with this kind of candid access any team would have been prime subject matter.   Perhaps it would have been easy to chronicle the year of a team certain to go deep into the playoffs such as the Colts or Patriots, but in selecting the so-so Ravens, a team with as much hope as talent, Feinstein includes the reality of losing as well as winning.  Each chapter reveals profiles of players and people that we would never learn of from a 'normal' sportswriter, but here we find ourselves understanding and identifying with a lengthy cast of characters... people who would have been nothing but a number on a uniform or another suit in the team's office.  While maintaining a journalistic distance, Feinstein nevertheless has no fear in tweaking the spoiled and pompus such as the FCC's "boy commissioner" Michael Powell and the wanna-be-dicator that is Redskins owners Mister Daniel Snyder.  All potshots are most deserving, by the way.  "Next Man Up" is a crisp clean read but it disappoints at the end as the Ravens fail to live up to expectations and fall short of the playoffs.  Feinstein's "straight journalist" approach seems content to simply record the facts and allow the conclusion to sit limply as the reader wonders, "Ah, so that's all, huh? 
 Epstein's account of Armand Hammer's depraved life is engrossing. It is one of the most interesting, well researched biographies ever. Hammer's almost unbelievable deeds are proof that truth can be stranger than  fiction. Once started this book is hard to put down 
 Me encantó este CD. Había escuchado una que otra canción de Jeremías, y ahora al tener este CD de verdad estoy fascinada. Canta lo que la mayoría de nosotros no nos atrevemos a decir, su ritmo es contagioso, diferente. De verdad, lo recomiendo 
 Are you a DVD addict? Like strange and confusing movies from around the globe? Don't know which version to buy? This is the book for you. If you understand the word psychotronic then this book is for you.  If you want to know which version of Cannibal Holocaust or Suspiria to buy then get this. You should buy both volumes 1 and 2 
 After the legendary "Change or Die" volume, it begins to feel like Ellis has little idea where to go next. The intensity and sense of earth-shattering plot developments begins to fade noticeably at the beginning of this volume, but Ellis keeps the characterization high (especially for Jackson King), and introduces Midnighter and Apollo, two of Ellis' greatest inventions to date. Though their characterization isn't fully developed yet, these first appearances are critical in understanding who these core members of The Authority are and who they will become. We also get a partial origin for the pair, which is a little too vague for my taste. This aren't the best Stormwatch stories of all, but they do handle the team quite nicely, and the historic introduction of Midnighter and Apollo makes this volume a must read for fans of The Authority.  The second part of this volume is what really makes it kick, though. The "Bleed" storyline is one of the more thrilling and dramatic installments of Ellis' Stormwatch. Though certain aspects of the story feel a bit far-fetched (Stormwatch invents a process for making molecules behave like video cameras in a previously unknown parallel dimension), the plot, drama, characterization, and overall execution are first rate. Ellis leaves us with many unanswered questions at the end, but I think this works quite well.   You can't do without this volume. Midnighter, Apollo, and one amazing storyline after. Truly a must read. 
 WOW.... and full of suspense!!!!!!  I love this movie!!! I reccomend it all of the time to friends and relatives and have bought it for christmas gifts. (with two copies for me).    I think Lee Lee Sobieski is a wonderful actress and I also think she and this movie should have won an oscar.  For probably what is considered by old terms, a "B" movie it was rated to low.  Watch it you won't regret it at all! 
 This is a beautifully written autobiography of a man breaking new literary ground. He openly wrote of his life as a gay man when it was ostensively illegal in GB, his search for love, and ultimately how he felt cut off from life. Each page aches with sadness, confusion, and need, never able to find what he wants from a human being, though he did late with his dog, Tulip, about which he wrote a classic book of love. There are quite unforgettable images thoughout the book, such as chance sexual encounters on a train ride with his mysterious father or the courtesies paid to him by his many lovers, such as a man with such bad smelling feet that he left his shoes on in bed. While there is a great deal of ironic humor in the book, its overall tone is one of loss, feeling lost in life and unloved in his many failed attempts to find a lasting partner. He also explores the mystery of his father, who hung out as a youth with a gay man he later knew as his landlord, and whom he never really knew or understood. It is a very moving book about an alien milieu and time, of a man hemmed in by inhibition and unfulfilled need 
 Browsing the section on Buddhism, I chanced upon a curiously titled book that was missing its jacket cover and appeared misplaced.  In retrospect, this was a fortuitous event that subsequently allowed me the great pleasure of immersing myself in Dr. Asma's absorbing work.  He impresses with both his erudition and extraordinary capacity for conveying mise-en-scene.  I will not attempt to recapitulate some of the already eloquently articulated comments presented by a number of previous individuals (refer, especially, to Mike Choe's review) except to say that Dr. Asma's ability to communicate some of the richness and influence of Theravada, within the specific cultural context of Cambodian society, is truly remarkable.  Not only does he comment generously from a social and interpersonal perspective, but from an intrapersonal mindset as well.  He shares a number of thought provoking insights, alternating smoothly between witticism and sobriety.  Ultimately, I found this book to be an extremely satisfying read and one which made a most significant and, hopefully, lasting impact on me.  I can say unreservedly, that it ranks as one of my all time favorites.  My sincerest thanks to Dr. Asma for taking the time to author this exceptional writing.   
 In between Blondie,the group female vocalist Deborah Harry has done some exellent solo stuff. It`s all here, with 18 tracks. Track 1 I want that Man, is a great heart and soul jumper with a funky drum flickering beat, and a "straight forward" vocal that hit the mark.This one shines. Track 2 French Kissin`in the Usa, is also in the category"greatness shines" with an open soundpicture in "synthezeisers land". A Sensual song full of emotions,that sparks in every musical department. An 80 ths touch of a Saxophone solo helps quite a lot too. Track 3 Brite Side is more on the "slow side of life". Debbie voice is great, but the music is not up to the right standard to follow here voice. Track 4. Sweet and Love is what we can call a touch of "disco gospel", with weird mixes of the psalm song Sweet Love Sweet Chariot, with Debbie touches all over. Sounds great. Track 5 Free to Fall is more in the standard department, but doesn`t lack atmosphere and in overall an ok  tune. Track 6 Well did you Evah, is average, and Iggy Pop sings duet, well, well, not my cup of tea. Track 7 I can see Clearly realy kicks away in the right direction. Sound`s like U2 "on speed". Fast forward. Yes indeed. It`realy moves in that direction.  Track 8 Strike me Pink, is a minor masterpiece. Sensual with enough eargasm to make you scream for more. Track 9 Communion, is more in the "average department" of songwriting. The melody is not realy there. To much spinning in the same direction. Track 10 Backfired is a funky song, that sound`s funky indeed, but nothing extraordinary, sorry to said. Track 11 In love with love, is a 80 ths style flashbacks melody, but the soul is not realy there.Track 12 Rush, Rush, is the "synth blipp/blopper" on the CD.It has a cosily atmosphere, and sounds ok. Track 13 The Jam is moving. Well, well. This is classical Blondie soundpicture, if you like that sort of thing. Unpolished vocal helps a lot.Track 14 Feel the Spin, is spinning ok, and is a fastforward danceable song. Track 15 Maybe for sure has plenty of everything, and is in the classical Blondie sound department. Track 16 Rockbird, is a great one, with a catching tune and rhytm wich really helps.Track 17 and 18, is new/mixed versions of Track 1 I Want that man. Nuff said before. Debbie goes solo, and the best of the best is here on this CD, and it shines and sparks most of the time. 
 This companion is an excellent guide to Dante's life, work, and thought.  It is especially useful for those readers of the Comedy who want more information on specific allusions than most footnoted editions can supply.  It is also helpful for an understanding of the complex political and religious turmoils in which Dante was embroiled, and which showed up continuously throughout his work 
  "The Dead Sea Scrolls had its origin in that winter of Hebrew studies at Princeton when,... Edmund Wilson added the wonder of an archaeological and journalistic flight into the very heart of old Palestine."   Leon Edel, Foreward    Our First Encounter: One day in late 1970 or early 71, while working for a refinery in Kuwait, a senior process engineering associate, Marino Coss, mentioned the relatively recent discovery of ancient Hebrew/Aramaic scrolls, and the power politics behind their dominance. That same evening, I drove to the only downtown Kuwait bookshop, and asked the manager, an English expatriate, about any book on the subject, he may have encountered. He told me that all related books are banned in Kuwait, but to my great astonishment he sneaked a book into my hands. "This is my review copy, I already presented my report to the censorship!" The book: The Dead Sea Scrolls 1947-1969, by Edmund Wilson was my great catch, that hot humid day in Kuwait. Wilson, a past reporter of the New Yorker magazine, visited the discovery site and met some of the key actors.  Dead Sea Scrolls:  The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has been one of the greatest events in biblical archaeology. No other similar event has helped us to better understand  the Bible against the backdrop of time and history.  Although the subject has been discussed at length by scholars and common folk, the truth is that few people fully understand what are commonly called the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS).  Many visitors to Israel  have had the opportunity to see these scrolls in the Jerusalem Museum's Shrine of the Book. It is truly awe inspiring  to see fragments of the collection of parchments and replicas of the full scrolls  when considering the archeological treasure exhibited there.   But what are the DSS?  What new truths are revealed in them? Do they contradict or support our basic understanding of the Bible?  Is there an "earth shattering" discovery that hasn't been made public for fear of creating a doctrinal debacle?  Are Jesus,  John the Baptist, or other disciples  mentioned in these writings? (David Sedaca)  Israel & Dead Sea Scrolls:  Wilson pursued the complex and still revealing discovery as the kind of subject that inspired his imaginative reconstruction based on a historical analysis of the great archaeological discovery. Wilson's essay on Israel, here included, started with his first reading Genesis in the attic of his mother's house, reflects the still continuing paradox of the Jewish Nation survival struggle. An excellent introduction by a famous critic concerning the discovery and early theories about the Qumran community. First appeared in the New Yorker in the 1950's where it introduced millions of Americans to the Dead Sea Scrolls. "An incredible find it was! The whole world soon was electrified with the announcement of the Dead Sea scrolls. Their importance can hardly be over rated. Not only have they confirmed the accuracy of the Old Testament, but they have shed light on the years just before Christ's coming." (Christian History Institute: What Happened this Day in Church History )  Edmund Wilson: Wilson, Edmund, 1895-1972, American critic and author, grad. Princeton, 1916. He is considered one of the most important American literary and social critics of the 20th cent. From 1920 to 1921 he was managing editor of Vanity Fair, and he was later on the staffs of the New Republic (1926-31) and The New Yorker (1944-48). Wilson supplied an account of the origin, discovery, and implications of the Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in 1947. He would update his original essay as The Dead Sea Scrolls, (1947-1969), with new findings. 
 I used the equations in the "Cars" chapter of this book to write a sweet street racing game for my senior project. I'm not real good at math or physics but I could easily follow the explanations. It was the only game physics book I could find that gave the equations for acceleration based on engine torque. Great book 
 I took a break after reading the first three chapters of Bernard Goldberg's "Bias".  I had just read so much ranting and raving from an apparent paranoid insider that I wasn't sure that I wanted to read the rest of the book.  I knew that what I had just read was bad writing; something akin to a mediocre sportwriter with his typewriter stuck on cliche.  However, I was a strong believer that a liberal bias was ever-present on network news.  I was prepared to enjoy a best-seller on the subject from an apparent similar point of view.  I was very disappointed.  Fortunately, the tone and the quality changed beginning with Chapter Four.  Instead of the personal stories of viscious attacks by former friends and colleagues, Mr. Goldberg got down to a serious discussion of the subject of major network media bias.  His subsequent chapters dealt with different types of bias in different areas; many of which I had not given as serious consideration to as I probably should have; labling conservatives but not their counterparts, the biased focus on AIDS and homeless reporting, the excessive influence of Feminists on the news, the hypocrisy of the heads of the different News Departments, etc.  I had expected more of a focus on how Republican issues seemed to be reported predominantly in a negative tone while the Democratic issues seemed to be reported in a predominantly positive tone.  Goldberg alludes to this somewhat but he acknowledges his liberal background and is only out to plead for fairness, not a conservative agenda.  Fair enough, we should all be for that rather than some sort of revenge.  As such, I think that there is plenty to learn for both sides of the political spectrum.    In my youthful liberal days, I often wondered why those in favor of the War in Viet Nam were generally portrayed as intransient, conservative neanderthals while the liberal spokespeople were characterized as thoughtful, intelligent advocates for positive change.  What bothered me the most was the lack of perspective on what the philosphy of the Right was all about.  If it was just "America: Love it or Leave It" (as the media seemed to imply) then whole generations were so out of touch as to be completely irrelevant.  I knew better and I suspected that the problem lay with how the media was failing to give a complete picture.  Thirty-five to forty years later, I see the same simplistic ignorance of any sort of intelligent philosphy in the Bush Administration.  Goldberg may not agree with all of my thoughts on the subject but, after the first three chapters, I found myself agreeing with all of his.  
 I feel everyone over 30 should read this book.  The Peace in War and Peace to me is about being at peace with yourself as opposed to a country that is not ingaged in war.  It took me along time to read it because I found I wanted to study it as I read.  It was very enjoyable and thought provoking 
 I cannot remember the last book before this that I read in one sitting.  "The Stuff of Dreams" captures the true essence of community theatre, from the problem of small audition turn-outs to the common poor health in the days preceeding opening, when stress has everyone's immune system lowered, something I hadn't quite realized was universal...but I'm supposed to be talking about the book as a whole, not just what reminds me of personal experiences.  One of the reviews on the cover says that this book "reads like a love story."  If, like I do, you realize that an accurate story about community theatre is inheritly a romance, regardless of the plot, then you must read this book 
 As recently as November 2006 Al Maysles stated that he had over 150 hours of footage that he shot for Gimme Shelter! WHERE IS IT???? They could easily release the entire 1969 MSG show on DVD, or maybe do another special edition DVD of this great movie! 
 This is the perfect gift for the comic book fan who has every comic book.  Also, looks great on a coffee table 
 This book is loaded with info on various early artifacts but is mainly for those involved in field work and academia. I wish I had looked a little more closely before buying it. What I really wanted was a pictorial reference with plenty of colored photos. The writing is highly detailed as you would expect for a scholarly reference. There are line drawings and b/w photos but no color plates. Most helpful for professionals involved in the excavation process and for museum curators, etc. However those interested in a general, mostly pictorial guide to early colonial artifacts should look elsewhere 
 I've been tearing through Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon mysteries ever since I discovered them.  The tighest and best story in my opinion is Firestorm - this one was a little harder to follow and I'm not sure I ever totally understood the denouement of the mystery.  But like with all the Pigeon novels, the characters and physical setting were interesting and well-drawn, and the story arcs that continue from book to book are intriguing, such as the relationship between Anna and her sister, and the relationship between Anna and Frederick the FBI agent (be prepared to be surprised!)  I don't think I'm going to read anything else until I've finished all the Anna Pigeon books out there - on to Blind Descent! 
 It was a great book because sometimes the author capitalized the letters of words.  This book is really funny because Junie B would get on the bus and say "I hate you, Jim".  Jim is the bus driver.  You don't see that in other books.  Kids will laugh at the funny words Junie B says 
 Gave the book to my 12 year old granddaughter.  She loves cats.  Really enjoyed the book 
 As a history buff, I fully enjoyed learning new things about the history of Christmas traditions.  I found it interesting that Christmas trees were first hung upside down.  Ace has written another wonderful book.  I have enjoyed reading many of his other treats and he has lived up to his reputation with this one! 
 This truly is the definitive set for alien fans.  It has two discs for each movie; containing the theatrical and special editions for each film, along with a ridiculous amount of special features for each film.  Along with all that is a ninth disc with miscellaneous material. For those of you who buy things without seeing them first, let me outline the basic plots of the movies.  To see my full reviews on "Alien", and "Aliens", visit my profile.  In "Alien" the seven members that comprise the crew of the Nostromo, a commercial mining ship heading back to earth from a mining mission, are woken from their hybernation by "mother," the ship's computer, in order to investigate a distress call coming from a nearby planet.  The crew are obliged to do this due to the "Company's" laws.  They descend to the planet, and three members of the crew go out to investigate.  While the crew members are out, Ripley, the crew's pilot, decides to decode the distress call, and soon dicovers halfway through translating that it isn't a distress call, but a warning.  Soon after, the team comes back, and attached to one of their faces is, is...what is it?  The rest is history. "Aliens" continues the saga loyally.  After the ending of the previous movie, Ripley is sent back to the planet to help investigate the loss of contact with a colony on "LV-426", as the planet is now called.  this movie is almost as good as the original, and most people certainly thought so, because Sigourney Weaver got an academy award nomination for best actress. "Alien 3" is an oft misunderstood movie, many people critizing it for the death of the remaining characters in "Aliens" except Ripley.  This time an egg was layed on the military ship headed for earth and it causes the ship to crash on an old prison world.  Soon an Alien is hatched and Ripley is once again fighting the nasty foe, but with a different twist... "Alien Resurrection" isn't that good compared to the rest of the series, but it has a couple of interesting scenes, so it's worth a watch or two. Overall the saga is wonderful, with it's amazing first installment, to its ok finale.  Definitely worth owning in my opinion 
 This is the most eagerly discussed book in my Philosophy in Literature class, because it raises questions of human identity, because it displays the complexity of race and culture, and because it is so very beautiful. It is an American masterpiece, standing beside and even above Bellow's "The Adventures of Augie March." 
 While I'm pretty new to AD and have database backgrownd, I liked the book for two reasons: 1. AD explained in terms that are clear to me and 2. The author explains WHY's and provides background for features and behavior 
 Rated as excellent.  Sherry Rogers MD has a gift for teaching that both the professional and nonprofessional can understand.  Any of Dr. Rogers books are terrific and, if applied, can greatly exhance health and may even save it 
 To say that I was profoundly impacted by Alice in Genderland would be a gross understatement. I sat down with it one evening and didn't stop until late into the night when I was finished. I'm sure I'm not the first... And as I sat down to write this review, I decided that it should be a simple summation of my own subjective experience that occurred during its reading and not so much a "literary review/ critique".  'Alice in Genderland' was to me like a lighthouse to a ship in a storm, a ship desperately trying to make port along a treacherous, rocky coastline. The swirling storm was my denial of who I really am (just your average guy who just happens to be transgendered) coupled with feeling completely alone in trying to make sense of it all. The rocks that I was frequently dashed upon were my ambivalence, exasperation, confusion, shame, and guilt; and the lighthouse was Dr. Novic's confident transparency in sharing the process of his own internal tumult and turmoil and subsequent acceptance and integration of Alice as a part of his being.  After laying out some applicable conditions, Novic states, ".....Face it honey, you're one of us"... and I just started laughing. It was like an internal dam broke, a dam that had been slowly crumbling for sure, but finally broke releasing a flood. And in that flood the ambivalence, exasperation, confusion, shame, and guilt washed away to be replaced by a peaceful, compassionate embrace of my whole self and the woman inside me.   Perhaps ironically, I've enjoyed my masculinity more since reading 'Alice' and embracing my femininity than I have in a long time; in fact, I've enjoyed being human more than I have in a long time too. Thank you for such a gift.     
 This is the best way to spend the evening with your children. It is very well done, and the actors made this a Neverland not to forget. We have watch it multi times and told eveyone we come in contact to rent it, buy it, but most of all WATCH it 
 Originally published in 1864, Marsh explains in wonderful detail the consequences of humankind's manipulation of earth's resources.  Truly an enlightened thinker 
 I purchased this item for my son who is a fan of Katt Williams and he thoroughly enjoyed it. 
 LeAnn's career has certainly been varied and it is unlikely that many people will love everything she's recorded. This particular album was the first to be released (but not her earliest recordings) and is definitely one for traditional country fans. The music is kept simple. Although a lot of different musicians are credited, I suspect this merely reflects different line-ups at different recording sessions. The only instruments credited are acoustic guitar, electric guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, drums, harmonica and keyboards - this is about as country as you get these days on a major label.   On the opening title track in particular, LeAnn sounds like Patsy Cline, whose influence is clear throughout the album. As far as I know, all the songs are originals except for Cattle call, originally a country hit for Eddy Arnold, who puts in an appearance here as duet partner. All the songs are excellent and LeAnn's performances are impeccable.  This is different from most of Leann's albums so, regardless of what you think about LeAnn\s later music, if you enjoy traditional country, buy this but if not, save your money and buy something more suitable instead 
 This is my first time purchased at Amazon.  The product I purchased is what I expected.  However, I must say Amazon extremely needs to improve customer service and organizational skill.  The watch I purchased did not include any sale receipt.  There was no warranty information included.  And most of all, no instruction manual came with the watch.  The box for the watch is torn and ripped apart.  This is not to mention I had a defective watch shipped to me before.  Obviously I have overrated Amazon before my purchase.  After this experience, I felt as though I made a purchase on-line through a "mom and pop" business versus a fortune 500 company.  I don't think it would take a rocket scientist to figure out if I will make any future purchase at Amazon 
 I saw Judas, live in West Palm Beach. Awesome and a great replica of the West Palm show. Strongly recommended for all Priest fans, a must have. Great to see the band back in action and I know they are currently working on their next album. Long live the "Original" Masters of Metal................ 
 I am now listening to this cd for the first time, and i have to say I love it!!!  The music is mesmerizing, almost putting me into musical nirvana.  I recommend it highly, as highly as I have ever recommended any cd!! 
 This book provides a balanced view of TR rather than simply praising his accomplishments in a glowing way.  Example:  his motives for the Spanish-American war are presented as self-serving in part.  Good photos and reading level is high-interest compared to some materials aimed at this age group 
 Excellent, engaging, easy to read and understand. 
 Lauren F. Winner takes an honest and sincere look at the practice of premarital chastity in Real Sex: The Naked Truth about Chastity.   In the first chapter Winner states:  "My goal is not to convert the broader culture to chastity......, but rather to provide companionship and strength for the journey for unmarried people who are trying to live in a Christian moral universe. As such, I do not spend much time making social-scientific arguments against premarital sex....Nor will I tackle issues like adultery, homosexuality, and divorce...But you will find that I talk, not infrequently, about marriage."   According to the author the real sex of which she speaks can only happen within marriage. Winner dispels the blatant lies and half-truths that society, and even the Christian church tells us about sex.   Winner especially takes the church to task for not talking enough about what chastity is, how to practice it, and why it is of the utmost importance to be chaste pre-marriage.   Every Christian, whether they are still a virgin or have been around the proverbial block a few times, who is taking those first timid steps down the path of chasteness should read this book.   
 History seems to through up years that resonate.  1066, 1492 and 1776 are all remembered by even the most absent minded of school children.  And 1968?  Well, important perhaps but not to the same degree as the years of the Norman Invasion, Columbus's search for the New World and the American Revolution.  It is true that 1968 stands out in terms of recent history.  The Prague Spring, Vietnam, civil strife in America and the assassinations of both Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy are all significant events.  Mark Kurlansky does well to bring these and other events to life.  His style is admirable and the events are brought back to life for all readers older than their late forties. Kurlansky is a fine writer.  My main bone of contention with Kurlansky is that he views 1968 through rose coloured glasses.  The events of the 1968, while certainly tumultuous, were of questionable significance.  We need to remember that, since 1968, the world has seen the end of the cold war and the return of freedom to Czechoslovakia, the end of the Vietnam War and a return to student calm across America and Europe.  We need to understand that while the Prague Spring, for example, was important, it pales in significance to the return of true freedom to eastern Europe.  Kurlansky's flaw is that while 1968 was a year of change which he covers with some skill, its significance can be overstated. A sense of perspective is required in all writers of history.  
 Cheech and Chong are back in such strong form here that it makes me wonder if I shouldn't reevaluate the previous film, Nice Dreams (1981), which seemed like a misstep to me on my last viewing.    Of course, there are some major differences with Things are Tough All Over.  For Nice Dreams, Cheech and Chong took the ultimate stoner/slacker route and made a film with little plot or direction.  It seemed like they were engaging in the same behavior offscreen as on and just and playing around with loose, rough ideas.  Maybe they also wondered what the heck they had done when later watching Nice Dreams (or watching the box office returns), because for Things are Tough All Over, they took an entirely different path and crafted an intricately structured comic misadventure where they play two interweaving sets of characters--Cheech and Chong, of course, and Mr. Slyman (Cheech) and Prince Habib (Chong), Arab brothers who serve as Cheech and Chong's employers in various guises.    The script for Things are Tough All Over may have been something Cheech and Chong were working on for awhile.  The basic subtext (as reflected in the title) is the recession during the Carter years in the U.S.  Slyman and Habib represent the flipside of the gas crisis (which is both metaphorically and literally in the plot at the same time in interesting and funny ways, even including flatulence jokes), and their prosperity as well as Cheech and Chong's role in the climax and denouement of the film represent the change of economic and social climate of the Reagan years.  This may be reading a bit too heavily into the film, but to some extent, these themes were definitely intentional.    Not that this is a serious film.  The gags here are on par with Up in Smoke (1978).  And given the engaging misadventure/road-movie plot, the gags have a purpose that makes them that much better.  Things are Tough All Over is also unusual in that it's the first Cheech and Chong film that's not focused on drugs.  Not that I dislike drug humor (or the idea of drug use), but not _having_ to make this film about drugs opens up the door for Cheech and Chong to focus on comedy for its own sake.  They go with material because it's going to be funny, and their timing is exquisitely on--they know just how far they can milk any particular joke for maximum effect 
 I found M.Nafte's book, Flesh and Bone: An Introduction to Forensic Anthropology very informative and helpful. Details and difficult concepts were easy to understand. The author has a good way of explaining scientific terminology and ensures that the reader is not intimidated. The photos are graphic and somewhat disturbing but they are used for educational purposes and not gratuitously. The preface of the book written by the mother of a child who has died under mysterious cirmcumstances and the dedication are especially touching. They illustrate the very humanistic aspect of the book as opposed to it being about hype and entertainment. Are there any other books by this author 
 In this, the tenth of the Brother Cadfael series, the year is 1141, and with King Stephen of England a prisoner in Bristol, the Empress Maud is negotiating with the people of London to be crowned at Westminster. Stephen's queen has sent an envoy to the bishop to plead her husband's cause when he is attacked in the street. One of Maud's own men, Rainald Brossard, is appalled at this unfair attack and goes to his rescue. In the ensueing melee, Rainald is himself stabbed amd killed. In the Abbey of St.Peter and St.Paul in Shrewsbury, the monks are preparing for the annual pilgrimage which is held to celebrate the anniversary of the day when the bones of St.Winifred, a Welsh, virgin saint, were brought to the Abbey. Cadfael is especially praying for a miracle to occur, as he has a slightly uneasy conscience about the actual retrieving of the bones which is explained in the first book of the series, A Morbid Taste for Bones.A strange pair of young men arrive at the Abbey guest house, one of whom is walking with bare, bloodied feet and bearing a very heavy iron cross around his neck on a thin cord. The other man never leaves his side for a minute, even during sleep. The mystery of the story is easy to work out but the whys and wherefores are more complex. It's another wonderful slice of mediaeval history brought to vivid life by Ellis Peters 
 I think this is really an excellent book, one that I would highly recommend.  Everyone should read this and realize the words of wisdom by Dr. Fuhrman.  I have changed my diet radically because of what he has written.  A real wake up call for me!  The diet is easy to follow and one that will revitalize and energize anyone that follows it!  A great read! 
 I saw this book on Reading Rainbow today, and I was enthralled by the story and the beautiful illustrations. The episode took Levar to the village the book was about and introduced us to the apprentice, now grown, being teacher to the village and his twin sons. My daughter is only a year old, but just the colors kept her attention. I look forward to when the words will have the same effect, as I'm sure they will 
 Although the characters and setting of the story are fictional, the  incident involved (ie. performing experiments on POW's) actually occurred.   Endo shows the different reactions which many Japanese felt in response to  the experiments.  There is a medical viewpoint and a military viewpoint as  well as a religious aspect and viewpoint of "normal" citizens.   It is scarey that something of such horrendous caliber could ever occur.   Endo describes with enough detail to convey the atrocity, but the focus is  upon the morality of the issue 
 Medieval culture is bookish.  The barbarian legacy is disguised.  Medieval man was a codifier, a builder of systems.  There was a Model of the Universe, a construct of answered questions. In the classical period the concept of Nature was greater than the goddess embodying it.  The angels of Scholasticism are the gods or aetherial creatures of the classical era.  Apuleius and Plato used what Lewis calls the Principle of the Triad.  Third things functiuoned as bridges between the other two.    Plotinus marks a transitional period, 200 to 500, when the medieval frame comes into being.  The era includes the reigns of Constantine, Christian, and Julian, the attempt at a Pagan revival.  Each side had the same educational attributes.  Although Plotinus is a genius, Lewis contends that Porphyry is the more influential writer.  Chalcidius transmitted Plato and produces the richest results in the work of the twelfth century Latin poets.  The contribution of pseudo-Dionysius to the Medieval Model is his angeology, CELESTIAL HIERARCHIES.  Boethius's CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY should be noted here.  He was a scholar and aristocrat.    The medieval universe is finite.  There are moral and emotional consequences to cosmic dimensions.  The four elements, hot, cold, moist, dry are present in Milton, Cervantes, Spenser.  God causes the Primum Mobile to rotate.  (The planets retained their Pagan names and qualities.)  There is a relationship to Aristotle's Prime Mover.  Fortune is a wheel.  Everything below the moon is mutable.  The four humors vary daily and individually.    History and fiction cannot be distinguished in medieval books.  Medieval narratives of the past lack a sense of period.  There are seven liberal arts, the TRIVIUM, and the QUADRIVIUM.  Medieval poetry is filled with solid instruction.  The model is used in service of a realizing imagination.                 
 Hands down my favourite Disney movie. This is the wonderful story of Fa Mulan, based on the ancient Chinese story of the girl who disguised herself as a man to go to war to save her aging, crippled father from having to go as representative of the Fa family.  My favorite part? There was romance without being kissy-goo-goo, "Mulan, I love you! I believe in you! You GO girl!".  It was realistic. Parts of it were violent...ish. (No violence is really shown DIRECTLY.) I wouldn't show it to REALLY small kids, because the Huns might scare them.  The only thing I didn't like? Why were the Huns grey? With yellow eyes? They weren't fantasy monsters...they were real people! I don't like the dehumanizing of the villains.  All in all, still and amazing, amazing, wonderful movie. Just don't buy that terribly sequel 
 `Catalan Cuisine, Vivid Flavors from Spain's Mediterranean Coast' by the very notable culinary journalist and editor, Colman Andrews, contributes to Spain's cuisine's being the third best documented European cuisine, after Italy and France. Andrews is an important figure in culinary reporting less from his books than from his position as editor of the excellent `Saveur' magazine which, with `Cooks Illustrated', should be one of the two magazines a foodie really should be reading.  `Catalan Cuisine' is as good or better than Andrews other ethno-culinary volume, `Flavors from the Riviera'. Like the earlier volume, its strengths lie primarily in history and a focus on ethnographic accuracy (without loosing too much in the way of practical cookery). For example, Andrews' recipe for the Catalan version of `tortilla espagnole' (potato frittata or omelet) is different from every other recipe I have seen from Spanish culinary experts such as Penelope Casas and Janet Mendel in that it contains no onion. This omission makes the dish a lot less interesting to me as food, but it reveals something which sets Catalan cooking apart from the rest of Spain.  In `Delicioso', Ms. Casas identifies Catalonia as the land of the casseroles. On first blush, there is little evidence of this attribution in Mr. Andrews' book. `Casserole' doesn't even appear in his index. But then, we recall a paragraph early in the book where Andrews identifies the most important cooking utensils in Catalonia. After the ubiquitous paella pan, there is the `cassola' (in Catalan, or `cazuela' in Castilian), an earthenware dish with deeper, straighter sides than a paella and an inside glaze. I really regret that Mr. Andrews didn't find his way clear to give us a picture of this dish, as I visualize it as a sort of `Tarte Tatin' dish a bit over 12 inches in diameter and about two inches deep.  One of the more interesting aspects of Andrews' books is that he always illuminates interesting historical and geographical aspects of his subject. On the Riviera, we learned that for a large part of its history, the French Riviera was politically a part of Italy. Here, we learn that the Catalan influenced region, `paisos catalans', extends into southwestern France, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Andorra, and even a corner of Italian Sardinia. The evidence of this influence is the range of the Catalan language (`Spanish' is actually Castilian, one of the four official languages of Spain, including Basque and Galician), which is not simply a Spanish dialect, but a language of its own, as similar to Italian and French as to Castilian. This is due to the fact that Catalonia was the center of Roman influence in their province, `Hispanolia', and Barcelona was the principle Roman seaport to this region, through which was introduced olive and grape cultivation techniques.  Andrews' primary premise in this book is that Catalan cuisine is at least as distinctive in European food as, for example the cuisine of Campagnia (Naples and Southern Italy). To this end, his organization is highly analytical rather than simply being a collection of representative recipes. The flagship of things distinct about Catalan cuisine may be the four classic sauces of the region, `allioli', `sofregit', `picada', and `samfaina'. While each has some similarities to sauces well known to French and Italian cuisines, the real importance lies in the differences. `Allioli' in Catalonia is made exclusively with garlic and olive oil plus salt (All Catalan food is heavily salted). Other minor ingredients such as vinegar and herbs are allowed (making it seem very much like vinaigrette). The similar Provencal sauce, `Aioli which includes eggs is dismissed as `fancy mayonnaise' which, by the way, Catalans claim was invented in Minorca and not the French city of Mayenne. `Sofregit' is similar to the Italian `soffritto' and the French `mirepoix'. `Picada' is very similar to the `pesto' of nearby Liguria in Italy. Samfaina is similar to ratatouille, cooked down to the consistency of a relish.  Next, practically a third of the book is taken up by `Part Three: The Raw Materials', in which Andrews discusses and presents recipes for the fifteen most important ingredients, which are eggplant, nuts, anchovies, rice, poultry, salt cod, mushrooms, wild game, snails, legumes, organ meats, olives and olive oil, eggs, seafood, and `the pig'. To the logical among us, this may seem a bit messy since one would think that anchovies and salt cod would fall under `seafood', and that organ meats would fall under `the pig', but it all works well enough, as the categories are a way of organizing recipes and not a guide to the Barcelona commodities market.  I really like the fact that aside from having an excellent bibliography, the book refers to several important books on related subject not only to support a point, but also to refer one to important recipes Andrews does not include himself in this book. His most important references are to Penelope Casas' `The Food and Wine of Spain' for recipes on sausage making. This is symptomatic, in that Parsons has no recipes for `basic' techniques such as pasta, pastry, bread, or charcuterie (sausages), in spite of the fact that both pasta and sausage and ham are important Catalan culinary products.  Andrews makes up for his unusual organization by providing an excellent Appendix of `Recipes according to Category' and other useful sources for Spanish tourism and shopping.  I think it's ironic that at the top of the cover is a blurb by the famous Barcelona chef, Ferran Adria praising the book, while there is not a single reference to Adria or El Bulli in this 1988 original book.  A superb culinary essay. Excellent for lovers of Spanish food and foodies in general. 
 If you love lemons and even if you don't think you do- you will love this drink! It is so crisp and refreshing chilled. Yes, it has sugar, but what fruit juice or fruit for that matter doesn't? If you don't drink soda like me and are kinda burnt on water- try essn's juices. Lemon and a little vodka make a great cocktail, too. They're a little pricey, but quality products usually are. It's also great to get it delivered to my door and save the trip to the store 
 This is a awesome find for me!  I know nothing about cooking, and this book has EVERYTHING!  Since it is well organized and presented, I highly recommend it to all new cooks 
 If you've used Photoshop Elements 2, then you have some background for Elements 5.  I figured it took me a full week of reading and computer operating to be comfortable with the updated program.  I still have a lot to learn. I looked at a number of books on Elements 5, and for me here are the top two:  one by Scott Kelby (with his strange sense of humor) and the other by Barbara Brundage.  Both books are priced the same.  Scott Kelby's has 487 pages and is printed on a semi-gloss paper.  He also includes a camera target for highlight, raw white balance, midtone (grey), and shadow (black).  The Brundage book has 554 pages printed on smooth paper which I prefer because it is easier to pencil in notes or underline items for future reference. Color reproductions with both books is excellent, with the edge to Kelby.  Unless you set your digital camera on automatic, you probably need to have your camera instruction manual close by. The same holds true for the Adobe Elements Program.  You can catch on to the basics pretty fast, but you need the Elements 5 book on your lap when you're working with the computer.  I also printed a number of pages from the instructions included with the Elements program, but when you condsider the time factor, the cost of ink and paper, you're better off buying the book 
 As a former chef, this book brought back memories of the things I used to cook for my staff. Sometimes the staff meal was the only bright spot in an otherwise monotinous day in the kitchen. The crew food was a chance to experiment and think outside the box, or sometimes just a chance to make the comfort food I was craving like everyone else. It may be hard to believe for the non-pros out there, but even in a world class restaurant, it is possible to get tired of the same old thing, but you'll never tire of the recipes here. This book made me remember how much I enjoy cooking, and why. 
 what an honest author.  he had a difficult life that most people would choose to forget rather than share.  
 Griffith invented the film language, Hitchcock invented the MODERN film language. Any films made after the 60's (obvious examples being Early Spielberg, De Palma's films, The Bourne Identity etc.) are heirs to Hitchcock's proprietary language and style. This book (written by the most literate film person ever-Francois Truffaut) reveals the master's innermost thoughts about each and every one of his films. The only glaring omission is that he hardly mentions Bernard Herrmann, who was to Hitchcock what John Williams is to Spielberg. Fascinating reading 
 After watching too many critically acclaimed movies which left me at the final credits feeling like petrified wood, I'm now allowing myself to rent and enjoy movies that I formerly shunned because they received poor reviews. Happily, I've progressed through that stage. I've learning that what a professional critic likes and what I like do not always match. I really enjoyed this movie. I admit that some of the satisfaction I got from viewing this movie came from the sight of the young male actor's attractive physique. At least it helped me understand the main character's temptation. I could imagine myself in her place. If only life was fair, I would be. If you're in the mood for light laughs, and a bit of poignancy, rather than the highs and lows of a dramatic roller coaster, this film will not disappoint 
 THERE WAS VERY GOOD ACTING BY ALL THE STARS IN IT. THE STORY WAS A LITTLE SLOW. I LOVE ROBERT DUVALL IN ANY MOVIE THOUGH. 
 Remember the feeling that parents don't understand because they lived in a differently? Remember being so frustrated and confused and having no idea what to do? In Amy Tan's novel "The Kitchen God's wife" she introduces situations that people can relate too. The cultural differences between succeeding generations of immigrant families in America cause many conflicts. If the families are to advance in their new country, it is critical that the cultural barriers be brought down through communication, understanding, and compromise. Winnie and her daughter Pearl face the generation gap. Pearl, being raised in America, is American while her mother is stuck with the old Chinese ways. Throughout the book, one learns the reason her mother is the way she is, the secrets her mother keeps, and the lies her mother has told. As the story continues, Pearl and her mother become closer because the cultural barrier separating the two is slowly coming down. Because Winnie is communicating with her daughter, Pearl becomes understanding and compromises with her mother. One learns the best way to be rid of a cultural wall is to always communicate, understand, and compromise. I recommend this book to people who have experienced what Pearl and Winnie have and to people who enjoy a book that completely grabs one's attention. Reading this book is like a drug. Once one begins, one can't stop. 
 I don't have television, haven't for 11 years. When I learned CBS was allowing free viewing over the internet I checked it out and started watching episodes of CSI, CSI NY, CSI Miami, and NCIS. I found NCIS to be my favorite and this particular show Dead And Unburied is my favorite so far. I enjoy the light-heartedness of NCIS. So I decided to download this episode from Amazon Unbox.  I really wish Amazon Unbox would allow me to burn shows I've purchased. As it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer. When Unbox expands this service to allow me to burn DVDs I will likely purchase many more shows this way. I like selecting individual shows 
 From just glancing at some of the previous reviews an outsider might actually believe this book is shallow. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion but I would call "From Sawdust to Stardust" ANYTHING but shallow. Over the years I've read many biographies and autobiographies from various cast members of the "Classic" Star Trek and IMHO this is the best of the lot. I'm also going to sound a bit biased but not only am I a "Trekkie" at heart I'm also a huge fan of Westerns, especially the ones from the 40's to the early 60's, many of which co-starred Mr. Kelley. This book literally brings him to life while reading it.   Occasionally a book is written where you never want to put it down, and this is one of those books. His love and devotion to his wife was never more apparent than what was mentioned throughout. I don't want to spoil all the wonderful surprises I found while throughly enjoying this book.  Lessons can certainly be learned from his experiences. This is an excellent book! Beam out and get a copy 
 Well, if you like Sam Bush, then this is a no-brainer.  Simply put, this is a great collection of both traditional and not-so-traditional bluegrass, etc. that almost anyone can enjoy.  To be sure, you can hear strains of Sam's New Grass Revival heritage on certain songs, but there is a lot of great traditional picking as well.  "Eight More Miles to Louisville" will satisfy any bluegrass traditionalist.  My favorites are "A Better Man" and the title song, "King of the World," which are a little more contemporary but I found rather moving and personally satisfying.  All in all, one of the best albums I've bought in awhile.  Highly recommended!! 
 This is a set of 5 DVD's that include the basics of krav maga self defence system. Krav maga is considered to be one of the most realistic self defence systems around, as the approach of the system is to concentrate on realistic self defence techniques, instead of sport-like aspects. I have practiced Krav maga for about 6 months now, and I purchased this set to support my training. Therefore, I had the chance to see how this instruction compares to the hands-on instruction I receive in my Krav maga class.  Generally speaking, the instruction in the films is good (or even very good). There are some techniques that are not taught in very detailed manner, but generally the instruction is good. There are also some techniques I found less than realistic for real life self defence, but generally the techniques are realistic. The techniques vary in difficulty from 1st degree (basic) techniques upward. I don't know at what level the most advanced techniques are, but I know that there is at least one 5th level technique included. On several occasions, the instructors mention that there will be more films with more advanced techniques.  The production of the films is generally speaking OK. The films have been filmed with only one camera, but usually that is enough. There are enough repetitions and narration in every technique to make it possible to understand the techniques. On top of that, they have broken most of the techniques down into learning stages, to further ease the learning. On some commercials, they mention that the set includes written instructions of every technique. There is no booklet included, however, as the instructions are written on-screen.   The set is available also on VHS, but DVD version has some extra material. Usually this means two extra techniques (there is no extra material on the Introduction film). The set includes five films: Introduction (the history of Krav maga), Basic combatives (the basic techniques), The best defense (defense against unarmed attack), In the line of fire (defense against handguns) and On the edge (defense against knife attacks). As the films are sold also separately, I have written more detailed reviews for each film separately 
 I liked this book as it touched on the basics of psychics. If you are looking for something deeper, this isn't it. But if you are just learning about it, this is a great starter book. The cases are excellent along with the topics and exercises. Well put together 
 This is exactly what I was looking for; it gives a quick in-and-out overview of colour management, with detailed information about calibration and profiles. Other books on this topic are twice the size, which I don't think is necessary for most people.  It goes into very good detail, with task-by-task instructions, and is well-organised and clear (One reviewer claims that it was "poorly edited and conceived"; I didn't have any of the problems they did) 
 The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is it's black-n-white.  I have been working with wire for three years now, and consider my skill as intermediate. I have read all the books I can find in bookstores that teaches anything about beaded and wire jewelry. I learned all the techniques just by reading these books once, and therefore never owned any of them myself. I started selling wired jewelry two months ago and started to feel the need to advance my wire working technique. I browsed through google search and found this book. Then I read the reviews on Amazon, and decided to buy it. It was as I expected -- only one colored picture, but the instructions were great! This is the only black-n-white instruction book that I found clear and inspiring. True, for $10 or $20 more you could probably get a instruction DVD, but if you don't want to spend that much (just like me), then this book is for you. It does not give you the pleasure of great photography, but isn't it more fun to produce your own work than appreciating others'? For the number and variety of projects in this book, I'll keep it even if it's black-n-white. It's not cheap, but it's worth it. (p.s. You probably need to have had some basic skills on wire working to get the most out of this book 
 the recipes in island cooking cookbook are great and easy to follow.  it has allow me to keep in touch with my caribbean roots by trying out and tasting the delicious recipes.  Bigup to Dunstan Harris for a job well  done.  I recently purchased the Island BBQ cookbook and look forward to  trying the recipies.  I would recommend this book to my family and friends 
 After having unsuccessfully searched for the perfect C tutorials and also K&R C, I can confidently report that this is by far the best introductory text to the C language.  You can think of it as K&R in a truly tutorial mode.  Very complete coverage of language features and just the right amount of instructional aid without being too terse on the one hand (K&R) and without being to plodding and wordy on the other (Deitel and others).  You should find it as a thorough yet relatively quick read.  Kochan has a very nice writing style which makes the tutorial also very enjoyable and rewarding.  The example programs are short and sweet; very similar to the kinds of programs found in K&R.  There are also lots of appropriately challenging programming exercises at the end of each chapter and half the answers are available on the author's website (www.kochan-wood.com).  Another good feature is that the tutorial is arranged by subject matter so you can use it also as a user-friendly reference in addition to K&R 
 Like all of his books, Bradley Trevor Grieve, makes me smile, laugh, cry, and enjoy the wonders of friendship and life again 
 Item was delivered quickly and in very good condition. No problems were experienced. Good job and thanks 
 Inside Al Qaeda Global network of Terror was one of the most compelling books about Al Qaeda and the new threat of terrorism that I have ever read. The non-bias straightforward writing of Gunaratna brought to light the vastness of terrorism and its reach throughout the world. The book is very concise in the facts and the chapters are very fluid like. If you desire to learn about Al Qaeda and how complex it really is, I recommend this book. Over all an excellent read 
 This bra is so comfortable and gives my chest area a nice lift while minimizing, by pulling the side area towards the center.  Very similar in comfort to the simply perfect bra with more shaping.  Looks nice because of the lace 
 A couple of years ago, I posted a review of the Ricketts letters collected by Katharine Rodger. In that review, I wished for a more comprehensive biography of Ricketts. I guess this is the book. It is well written, well researched and well documented by references to sources. I think its main benefit is that it separates Ed Ricketts from the characters in John Steinbeck's novels and The Log from the Sea of Cortez. Evidently, Steinbeck was first and foremost a novelist, even when writing "nonfiction."  Tamm helps explain Ricketts's relationship with Toni Jackson and presents some new (to me, anyway) information on his trips to Vancouver Island. There is quite a lot of material here about Joseph Campbell's influence on Ricketts (and vice-versa) that isn't in Steinbeck's various writings on Ricketts. There isn't much new about Ricketts's life before his lab (including notes and correspondence) burned down in 1936.   Tamm has a tendency to use Ricketts's, Steinbeck's, and Joseph Campbell's writing as jumping-off points to his own ethical and environmental perspective and even to preach a little. I largely agree with his views, but I don't think this biography is the place for them.  Tamm emphasizes Ricketts's philosphy, as Steinbeck and others have. Ricketts took this work seriously, but only one of his three large essays was ever published. His "Non-Telological Thinking" appears as the Easter Sunday entry in the narrative half of The Log from the Sea of Cortez, which Ricketts coauthored with Steinbeck.   On Ricketts's philosophy, Tamm writes: "He was pioneering a new mode of thinking that contained all the elements of what would become 'deep ecology' in the 1970s." (p. 239). "Deep ecology" is a viwpoint that recognizes an inherent value in all species (value beyond their use to humans) and holds to mostly conventional liberal politics (Wikipedia, 11 April 2006). These ideas seem commonplace today, though they rarely go by that hoity-toity title. I doubt they were exceptional in the 1930s and 1940s (e.g., John Muir advocated nature for its own sake decades earlier). If Ricketts's ideas were unique, Tamm should have explained then-prevailing environmentalism to put them into context. Further, I would have liked a discussion of the "deep ecology" view as it progressed into the 1970s. What other authors (especially biologists) were influential in its development? Had they read Ricketts's work? (aside: David Ehrenfeld has a nice essay on inherent value, called The Conservation Dilemna, in his book, The Arrogance of Humanism).  The discussions of Rickett's scientific work would have been better if Tamm had comparared it more thoroughly with other biologists of the time, and discussed its long-term influence in biology. The book doesn't clarify to me whether Ricketts's documentation of the collapsing Monterey sardine fishery was a new approach to population ecology and resource management, or if he used existing analytical techniques. Ricketts is very well known among California marine biologists. Has his work stood up over time, and is it still relevant to modern researchers?   Finally, I was bothered by Tamm's inclusion of the false (but widely believed) "Chief Seattle" speech. The text Tamm quotes on page 242 (quoted from Joseph Campbell's 1990 book, Transformation of Myth Through Time) was actually written by Ted Perry in 1972 for a film script. Campbell's flawed research isn't Tamm's fault, but I wish Tamm had checked the source before propagating this myth still further. Much more on the Chief Seattle story is available at the Snopes Urban Legends Reference Pages and links posted there 
 I can't name a track on this album I don't love!! Gareth should be super proud of his work. Although I do think that overall my favourite song is "All Cried Out." It's absolutely AMAZING!!! I like how there are 2 CD's and that each has a flavour all its own. You can enjoy it all the way through, and over and over again. The first CD (Night) is more dance pop music so it's a bit funkier. The second CD (Day) is more ballads but there are some more up tempo songs on it too 
 Mr. Hunek conveys the power of the animal/human bond through beautiful photos of the chapel and whimsical woodcuts that describe the characteristics of our canine companions.  The book tells how this unique chapel came to be built following the authors critical illness.  As the sign outside the chapel says, "All breeds and all creeds welcome.  No dogma allowed".  This book would make a cherished gift for all dog lovers regardless of their religious or spiritual beliefs 
 This book was SO adorable, I used it to discuss Fall with my toddlers and preschool kids at the library's Storytime I present each Wednesday. Beautiful pictures and explains the changes of Fall in a way that is both sweet and explanatory for your children. Cute! 
 Let me start by stating; You need to cover the Nano. It gets scratched, worn and ugly very quickly without a case and this case covers all the bases; moisture protection, improved grip, scratch resistance, drop protection, access to controls and ports. I have tried a few covers for my Nano, this has been my favorite.  The "dirty half-dozen" reasons to buy: 1. tight fitting cover that does not slip off (I have had this happen with leather covers) 2. rubber material assures good grip even with sweaty hands (do you work out with your nano?) 3. hard plastic cover for screen really protects and lasts a long time (the soft vinyl covers offered with most other cases scratch and tear rather easily) 4. A three pack! (Share with friends and family? change your clothes? change the case!) 5. Excellent price/value (compare with other products out there you will see what I mean) 6. Looks good, does not spoil the Nano's visual appeal (important since we all love the look of our Nano, no?) I highly recommend this product 
 Penn and Teller are comic magicians who go back to the 1970s, but did not make it big until their appearances on David Letterman and Saturday Night Live in the 1980s.  Since then they have made guest appearances on many television shows including Home Improvement.  And recently a cable show has given them their own time slot.   Penn and Teller have also written three best-selling books: Cruel Tricks for Dear Friends, How to Play in Traffic, and this book How To Play with Your Food.  Most magicians do not share their secrets.  But Penn and Teller love sharing the secrets of magic in a comic way.  Some of the topics covered in this book are "Genteel versus vulgar food play"; "Why all miracles are fake"; Stabbing a fork in your eye"; popcorn and pizza tricks; the JFK trick; and many others.  My favorite is the "Oliver Stone Melon-Head Trick", which is not for the squeamish.  The only caveat is that they did not include the ImpeachBlair vanishing trick, but perhaps they can make the White House lap dog disappear?    
 Every student of history must read this book. (ages 10-up). Booker T. Washington was a brilliant scholar and compassionate human being. His detailing of life as a young slave boy, and life during/after the Reconstruction, is heart-wrenching, but must be read in order to fully understand the era. At times, I felt that Mr. Washington was too "kind" in trying to understand and explain the motives of the white people. He was a visionary and tireless worker for the African Americans; therefore, this work is a must-read for all Americans. 
 I must say that I am generally not interested in watching a romance movie, but this movie is a definite exception. It "Possessed" a great soundtrack that fit the scenes perfectly, captivating scenery that is incredible, and a cast that perfectly fits the mold of the story. From beginning to end it was an absolute success of a complete movie. It piques the curiosity, it warms the heart, and it even manages to make you feel slightly better about life after watching it. buy it, you won't regret it 
 Great book with informative techniques and insight. Accompanying DVD is both entertaining and educational. Good reading for the winter months to get the juices flowing. 
 "The Fellowship of the Ring" composes two books in "The Lord of the Rings" history, the first focusing on the Hobbits and the Shire whereas the second develops the Fellowship whilst filling in unanswered gaps of other characters from the first book.  The author skillfully mixes a concoction of effortless lyrics, wicked monsters, and intermittent magic in a dark and foreboding fantasy.  As part of an epic tale, not only does "The Fellowship of the Ring" masterfully addresses the responsibilities of good versus evil but also examines companionship and loyalty within the confines of a tremendously treacherous task.  Suspense grows as the importance of the Ring-bearer's objective is fully appreciated as the Ring's power incites an evil influence on those nearby.  Regrettably a peculiar encounter involving Tom Bombadil, a vigorously charming and unique individual, needlessly diminishes the potency of the Ring.  Many readers feel the entire episode concerning Tom and Lady Goldberry is unnecessary to the progress of the menacing plot other than a silly interruption.  The collection I own has "The Hobbit" along with all books of "The Lord of the Rings" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series.  As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie (although it is one of the greatest movies of all time) thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.  I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.  Thank you 
 The fact that they call this premier is a little overdone. The reality is that this is the "Pro" version with a few bells and whistles which in most cases do not warrant the additional price 
 Being a Baritone Sax player myself, I understand whats going on here... maybe not what went on inside jeru's head, but the ideas musicaly.  All in all, a BRILLIANT album.  Recommended for anyone who likes west coast cool, or to anyone for that matter.  A smart album, from a smart man.  Thats why Gerry's the best, and always will be 
 This book is a grand slam for a rookie writer John Hart. Hart is a tallent that could well rival Grisham, Conroy, and Patterson. His ability to describe moods, people, places, and events is with out a doubt his strength and the reader will have a hard time putting the book down. Full of twists and turns this fast paced work tells the story of Jackson "Work" Pickens, a small town North Carolina lawyer who is trying to track down his father's murderer. His biggest problem is that he is the number one suspect and a gung ho detective is trying to make a name for herself by taking down "Work" at all costs. "Work's" dead father was a well-known, shady lawyer with plenty of enimies, any of whom could have pulled the trigger. The clock is ticking for "Work" to find the killer before the police pin the whole mess on him. It is a wonderful mystery with, colorful local characters, old money, new money, and troubled families with dirty secrets that keep the reader coming back for more chapter after chapter 
 My 13 month old daughter loves this book and likes to listen as I sing along when we read this book. She also likes to poke her fingers through the holes and has a great time. Overall a good book 
 A narrative of suspense, action, and horror set inside the mind of Donald Burgett as he struggled to become one of the members of the elite 101st Airborne Division and ultimately survive through World War II. Currahee is written such that one feels as if he is following the main character, Burgett, step by bloody step. This first person narration by the hardened war veteran, Burgett, adds a suspense and gritty realization to the horrors of war. Every chapter focuses around Burgett's adventures and deadly battles he encountered regularly. He describes in detail every action he took, and every shot he fired so that the reader can never miss a beat. He explains his training and how damn near impossible it was to become a paratrooper. The joke going around during his first day of boot camp in 1942 went, "If two doctors were on each side of you lookin' in your ears and could see each other, you were a new member of the 101st Airborne!" At only 18 years old, Burgett had the heart and mind of sure will and determination. He did whatever he had to do in order to pass the required training and receive his jump wings, qualifying him as one of the best in the army. I am convinced that Burgett and his entire generation who were tough enough to make it into the 101st became the most admirable "bunch of guys" this nation has ever had for now and generations to come. We, the people, of the United States of America owe them our solemn gratitude and utmost respect that they laid down their lives so that your children, and my children, might be able to live in freedom for years to come.  I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 15. Not only can the language be foul, but the amount of detail in the actual WWII fighting can become too much to endure for young teenagers. The amount of agony, blood, and gore described even left me sick to my stomach and filled with sadness over the amount of death of those brave American soldiers. These citizen soldiers were just like you and I, working part time at the grocery store and helping their parents clean the table after supper. But when the time came, they all went out to defend their country without hesitation, without remorse for the enemy. That is the beautiful part of this book, that men such as Burgett would answer the call and damn well know that they were risking their lives for the sake of their mothers, fathers, and all of people who lived in this country. That is why every time I read this book I cannot put it down because I know that Burgett was MY AGE when he was in the fields of Normandy risking his life to preserve the sacred word, freedom. With such eminent detail, I often find myself ducking my head thinking that those bullets are going to strike me. I often wondered, "He was killing Germans while I am still learning Math, how weak and insignificant I must be compared to him." When I read the first page, I could not stop until I reached page one hundred and fifty. So please, pick up a copy of Currahee and become engulfed with a true story about how self-sacrifice and military excellence ultimately won World War II and preserved freedom to this day.  
  "The Laughing Corpse" shows that the Anita Blake series does not need the intrigue of vampire to elevate the plot of each novel to the next level.  The main story line in the book has nothing to do with vampire, but instead voo-doo, necromancy/reanimation, and murder.  This, the second book in the series, is much more of a mystery than "Guilty Pleasures", the first, was.  It's nice to have something so different yet consistent with the tone of the first book.  Anita Blake, as a character, is fleshed out a lot in this novel.  She is taken in a direction I hadn't foreseen, and we get to know her a lot better as she comes to realize who she is, what she can do.  And she is dark.  Way dark.  One little problema I have with the book is that, like the first one, there are a lot of secondary characters.  The only main character is really Anita.  The book pretty much focuses on her, and most other characters only appear once or twice.  As I read more of the series, I'm sure each character will be easily recognized, but at this point it's hard to associate a name with a character when I've met the character such a limited number of times.  It has to be said, though, that Jean-Claude is a joy.  And I have to add:  This book is by far the goriest I've read.  But hey, if you can't stand the blood, get the hell away from the vampire hunter.    9/1 
 Prash Trivedi, India's most insightful young astrologer offers what is probably the longest, most researched and most original book on Rahu and Ketu published in modern times. This book is worthy of serious examination by all students of Astrology and all those interested in the great mysteries of life, death, karma and transformation 
 "Dreamland", as a whole, is a very very good dance album which is hindered by occasional moments where it turns into a guilty pleasure (pretty much every time the female vocalist kicks in). This hurts its overall appeal which "Children" tried so hard to break into (this was one of the biggest dance hits of the early 90's). Dance music fans will still love this even if it's a bit questionable at times. The musicianship is wonderful - it's mostly piano based with heavy usage of synths (and occasionally cool thunder effects). Robert was a former Italian classical musician who decided to dabble in the electronica/dance realm, and he definitely made the right choice! It comes pretty darn close to being a classic (this was a HARD decision), but I think that, considering a lot the songs tend to sound very similar to other ones, I won't give it a "5". If you like dance music and you don't mind the female vocalist who appears on a couple songs, then you will probably love this! Recommended!  Highlights include: everything except for "Fable" and "One & One 
 As is the case with most great writers, Cormac McCarthy's genius is primarily found in the details (the best words in the best order). His craftsmanship is given voice in soaring, searingly brilliant language that draws on distinguished forebears (Melville and Faulkner) and is welded to a subtle, layered and keenly perceptive moral vision.  A writer to whom we can turn not just to escape, but to learn, McCarthy is a master artist whose novels are built to last.   Throughout "No Country for Old Men" (2005), the author fashions a sparse, carefully weighted prose (simplified in comparison to his masterpiece, "Blood Meridian") to portray characters in the varying, mottled condition of their souls. Their very flaws are what distinguish them in their (fallen) humanity from a man thriving in the realm of darkness. Discrepancies in plot and action, carped at by some reviewers, are in truth reconciled when seen as illuminating the wavering tendencies of the human beings portrayed and their various apportioned destinies.  The hunter Moss steals drug money he comes upon in the Texas desert, knowing full well the danger it brings, not just to himself, but to his wife and extended family. His precarious balance on the tightrope that runs between good and evil leads him down the path to ruin.  In the hinterlands (so we may believe) beyond good and evil, a hitman named Chigurh views himself as a walking talisman- an instrument simply acting out his destructive part in the human drama with the confidence that the predestined cosmic die has been cast. Chigurh manifests a demented, legalistic scrupulosity and honor in upholding the cards that have been dealt by fate and his role as executioner of a grim, aleatory philosophy.   The narrative thread by the ageing Sheriff Bell (woven from start to finish of novel)- both his pondering of the bloody events and ruminations on a lie under which he has lived his life- charts the "fencepost" position occupied by most human beings. Unlike the nihilistic neutrality of the Kid in "Blood Meridian" (choosing not to choose)- Bell makes choices, some good and some bad, but none in the sense offered by Chigurh's false game of chance or ("Blood Meridian" ) Judge Holden's diabolic will to power.  Every book by Cormac McCarthy deserves respect- if "No Country For Old Men" doesn't rise to the heights exhibited in "Suttree" or "Blood Meridian", it still ventures forth into a territory of the soul that very few writers are bold or talented enough to tackle. 
 I enjoyed this book and got through it quickly. It's dark and sometimes depressing, but the writing is excellent. I felt I knew the characters and fell in love with them all 
 By day, Arthur Dog, Dogopolis Museum of Art security guard, and lover of paintings by Vincent Van Dog, Pablo Poodle, Henri Muttisse, and Leonardo Dog Vinci.  By night, Art Dog, masked grafitti artist painting the city in beautiful color.  "No one knew who Art Dog really was... until one night at the museum."  Yikes!  Someone has stolen the Mona Woofa!  After being falsely accused, Art Dog paints his way out of jail, lifts his nose in the air..."I can smell art a mile away," and saves the day in superhero fashion.....  Thacher Hurd has authored an entertaining, wacky picture book that's sure to tickle the funny bones of young and old alike.  His delightful, high-spirited text begs to be read aloud, and is full of terrific sound effects, wordplay, and dog puns.  But it's his bold, bright, and splashy illustrations that really make this book stand out and sparkle.  Perfect for youngsters 4-8, Art Dog is a funny, engaging, rip-roarin' adventure you don't want to miss.  "Who was Art Dog?  Who was this painter in a Brushmobile, catcher of crooks, bringer of light to the Dogopolis night?"  Only readers will know 
 Manuel Ortiz's, One New People: Models for Developing a Multiethnic Church, is a well-timed book for a day of great segregation in our churches. The segregation problem in our churches mirrors quite directly the continued segregation of races, social classes and any other means by which people differentiate themselves found in out society. Sadly, we follow in the footsteps of a fallen people as opposed to leading the way and standing out in holiness as Christ intended his people to do. Yet, despite the state of our society and our churches within them Ortiz offers hope and looks positively into a future where these distinguishing factors are replaced by a view of people in and out of the church that sees them as a new nation, a Christian nation. Several of the principles and specific examples he provide model convincingly the potential of intentionally setting out on a quest of reconciliation, not only unto God but in practice now as we seek to break down the walls built around the many elements that hinder us from seeing the inner self and intentions of God's diverse people.      The strength of Ortiz's book lay in his use of church models seen in specific churches throughout the United States. They are helpful in seeing the pros and cons of both multiethnic churches and multi-congregational models, a distinction he clearly analyzes. If there is a downside to the book it is not contextually rather, in the organization and often-random points inserted and left unexplained. Sadly, these points nail an idea on the head but don't fully nail it down for the reader. This can be frustrating. In the end, he leaves the reader excited and more fully ready for the task of multiethnic or congregational models of church. However, it is only excitement and leaves some room for further study and compilation of a more resourceful implementation of his concepts. That would be to answer the question, of what this looks like and how, practically speaking, do you do it?      Anyone interested in pursuing integration, or as many are calling it reconciliation over ethnic lines, this is a must read. It is extremely insightful and opens up a challenging world of great hope and opportunity. It provides a very realistic understanding of what multiethnic ministry could be. From this book, the reader will easily be able to know whether or not a ministry such as these is something they wish to pursue more seriously. However, a word of caution, those not really wanting to be convinced of this great form of ministry ought not read Ortiz's book. Otherwise, you may find yourself caught up in the beautiful possibilities of a diverse world more perfectly in the image of God 
 This book, when compared to what is written today, is excellent. Trollope is a master with words - as all readers of his works will agree. He has a tremendous command of the written word - unlike authors of today!! However,  for Trollope compared to Trollope, the book is just so-so. Many of his  other novels are far superior. The book concerns the trials and  tribulations of Miss MacKenzie after she inherits a fortune and then looses  it. We see how her friends, neighbors, and male paramours react to her as  her status in life changes. It's, as all Trollope books, enjoyable, but not  one of his better books 
 The truth can be more shocking than fiction, and here's the ultimate political thriller. And it's all true. This powerful memoir details how Woodward and Bernstein, as young reporters covering bland local issues, got the opportunity of a lifetime to unhatch a story of vast political corruption and unethical dirty tricks (known loosely as Watergate), and they directly started the domino effect that eventually toppled President Richard Nixon and got many of his cronies thrown in the slammer. In addition to crucial information on the scandal itself, this book is also an invaluable look into the process of investigative journalism, and how reporters cultivate their sources and follow up on obscure leads that can break out into a huge story. Note that the book can be hard to follow in places, especially in regards to the names of the many Washington conspirators involved. This is more of an issue with Watergate itself, rather than Woodward and Bernstein's writing, because the scandal was just too huge for anyone's comprehension. You will find yourself continually looking back to the cast of characters that the authors have helpfully placed at the front of the book. And finally, this book is a crucial vindication of the true necessity of a vigorous free press in America. Kudos to Woodward, Bernstein, and all of their courageous colleagues for exposing this ultimate arrogance of power and the damage it did to the American democratic process. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 If I could give ten stars, I would.  I LOVE these things!!!  This is the first book light that actually does the job.  I use it at home, in the van waiting at various after school events (better than overhead lights), on planes...everywhere the lighting is poor.  When my kids were little and I'd sit with them until they fell asleep, this little wonder light kept me reading without straining my eyes!    With the exception of very large books, the regular size covers virtually all pages without having to shift the wedge around to see.  I wouldn't bother with the paperback sized one, unless you only ever read small paperbacks.  The book's page is illuminated evenly from top to bottom and side to side.  I've given these as gifts to my book loving friends, and now they are giving them as gifts.  Batteries last a very long time so you aren't spending a lot of money every time you use it.  The "glass" does scratch, but only if you abuse it.  My light is usually tucked inside a book so the surface doesn't get damaged.  However, if you do scratch the "glass", it doesn't affect your ability to see through to the page to read.    After wasting money on Itty Bitty Book Lights, lights that clip on, etc., I can't rave about this product enough 
 Apart from the beautiful horned out main theme, this album boasts one of the greatest inspiring fanfares you'll ever hear. My wife even likes it, and that's saying something. Ha, HA from her.  As a comparison to Hoosiers.  Same style but they're uniquely their own. I love both scores, but Hoosiers is the only one of the two movies I like 
  If only for the two stories `Healing' and `The Drainage Ditch' from Giselle Commons.  I didn't know any of the authors but the range of stories looked interesting -   The Relationship Intimacy First Experiences Qualities of Erotic Moments Anticipation Playfulness Humor Physical Context Power Transformation The Forbidden Group Sex Anonymous Sex  The introduction by the editor is as titillating as the book itself.  This is definitely a Keeper!  Quote from  jacket - "The contributors to this volume, in their willingness to extend themselves and expose some of the most intimate parts of their personal lives, have helped to promote a cultural understanding that adventure and enjoyment are positive aspects of female sexuality, and should be celebrated with pleasure and joy-not shrouded in guilt and discomfort." -Lonnie Barbach, Ph.D.  
 This book not only gives you a history lesson on  how Hacienda life was like in the past, but it also shows how Haciendas are working today, and  how they have influenced American living.  Like the first book, Mexican  Country Style, they have included beautiful pictures that make you feel  like you are there.  I highly recommend this book 
 We have a large group of friends that gets together on a regular basis and our usual game of choice is the 80's or 90's Game!  We play 'guys against girls', and usually we make the guys answer the 80's questions and the girls answer the 90's questions.  (I think the 80's questions are a little harder just because you have to think back another whole decade!) If you have a lucky roller you can really get ahead in the game using the "free jump".  Also, if the guys land on sports questions too much they usually end up beating the girls. The best part about these games is that the questions aren't too serious or too impossible like Trivial Pursuit.  If you lived in the 80's or 90's, you should know the answers - the hard (but fun) part is just trying to remember!  Ladies, do you remember the song that Joey McIntyre (former NKOTB) came out with solo in 1999? I recommend buying both games - its fun to intermix the questions! FUN, FUN, FUN 
 Yes, this airing does have many of Lewis' jokes that have already been shown elsewhere; and yes, it hardly does the listener justice to listen to what he has already done without some sort of incentive to do so. Well, how about this? LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN MORE EXTENSIVELY THOUGHT-OUT! These are the same jokes because Lewis adds more in between each one to amplify how he's feeling, you twits. There are any words that can express how tired I am of reading reviews whose only content are, "Get his earlier work because this has been done before LOL LOL i'm retarded," because it hasn't! Unless, of course, the material you're referring to has already been heard on some unreleased bootleg found online, in which case I suggest you stop finding bits and pieces of Black's work you shouldn't be looking for in the first place, and get over it. Not on any of the DVDs or CDs I've heard of Lewis' (and I think I've heard and watched almost everyone of them) have I been able to hear the same material than I have with "Luther Burbank Performing Arts Center Blues"; there have been the same ideas, sure, the same background for the jokes such as the Super Bowl or George W. Bush's incessant onslaught on getting those "devilish homosexuals" not to be able to call themselves bound spiritually. But that doesn't mean at all that they're the same jokes, because he adds different reasoning and substance in between them to make each one fresh and all-the-more hilarious. So please keep your bloody mouths shut about it being the same.  Anyway, I love this recording. I love Lewis' passion whilst speaking about the musicians who can't really play music (especially with their manhood clutched in their grip), and also MTV, who for some reason has still been given authority to run the half-time show. Now granted, I don't watch football, I never really have; nor any sports, for that matter. I occasionally watch baseball, but otherwise, no, I don't like sports, so forgive this rather inexperienced question: why the quip is MTV allowed to run half-time shows? I'm not aiming to turn this into a long rant or anything, but seriously, why? It makes no bloody sense; unless, obviously, the NFL wants their adolescent viewers masturbating in the stands at the football game now. That's really the only conceivable use I can conjure from that precious decision, but hey, I also think Lewis Black has separate material on this album, so what the [expletive deleted] do I know?  Moreover, when Lewis gets to Schwarzenegger and the state of California, I nearly bust my gut laughing. It's amazing how honestly comical a man can be simply by saying a few words. "Arnold Schwarzenegger is the governor of your state." So few words with Black, it seems, is all he needs to get his crowd going, especially when they're so trite one can't help but laugh. He does the same thing with Dick Cheney a lot, too, on other releases; subsequently, I suggest you find the ones like "The End of the Universe," or go watch "Red, White and Screwed," Lewis Black's HBO special that aired sometime ago, and watch first-hand how boiled his passion goes for the Vice President of the United States. It's downright ghastly, I assure you. That then leads into the run-on about Ronald Reagan, which, I suppose, you can say it's like the same joke, because Lewis Black uses the man's name in another skit he does, but that really doesn't count because the punch line (whenever there bloody is one with Lewis, less half-than-not, really) and body of the jokes are pretty much precisely unalike, but hey, whatever. He's a beautiful comic.  Yeah, well, that's all I have. I'd love to comment more, but I guess I don't want to. Long story cut short, here: if you're already familiar with Lewis Black but you haven't heard this show, I recommend you get it; or, if you have never heard Lewis Black and you think it'd be more prudent to get one of his earlier releases, then all I can is: if you want to, go ahead. I personally don't think it's necessary, though. I think none of his material used on this release will preclude you from enjoying any of his earlier stuff, and vice-versa, because it really doesn't matter which order you keep it in. Listen to whichever record you want to, because that's wonderful thing about comedy: chronological order means absolutely nothing.  In closing, I'll say again: I don't think this release encompasses Lewis Black's same material; duplicated, sure, but these sets of jokes are definitely more refined. So, as stated, just get over it, people, and enjoy the man in his universe 
 I never thought I'd get a Tracy Chapman album that was better than her debut, but this is it. It takes songs from her first five albums, including 4 tracks from her debut, and 4 from her "New Beginning" album. The first 4 songs alone from "Collection" make this worth owning, they're all perfect. But other tracks like "Crossroads", "Smoke And Ashes", "All That You Have Is Your Soul", and the popular "Give Me One Reason" are all wonderful too. There's not one bad song here, and each one that I didn't know previously, I now love as well. Highly recommended. If you're wondering why this is import only, I found it at Best Buy for 15 bucks. 
 Five Stars,Five Mics,XXL, Whatever! Every track deserves top marks. Dre and Snoop make Classic Material and this is arguably their finest work 
 Like I said, this is the only Tom Cruise film I have EVER enjoyed.  His acting is still wooden and lame, but he plays a young, immature kid, so it suits him still today.  I am going to buy the soundtrack again after loseing my last copy.  Enjo 
 I enjoy every one of the songs on this CD. What a great CD to listen to on a long ride home from work. Every song has such a soothing sound. Enjoy! 
 Robert Fagles' translation of Homer's "The Iliad" is rightly spoken highly of.  The companion piece to "The Iliad," "The Odyssey," is likewise a highly estimable work.  As with the earlier work, Bernard Knox's thoughtful Introduction provides a valuable context for the epic poem.  As those interested in Homer know, "The Odyssey" is the follow up to the earlier work.  Here, Odysseus' life after the Trojan War is chronicled.  His peregrinations throughout the seas is well described.  The difficult straits of his wife, Penelope, are outlined, as suitors try to win her hand in marriage after the assumed death of Odysseus.  Also central to the story line is the growth of Odysseus' son, Telemachus.  After many travails, and being punished at the hands of the gods, Odysseus returns to his home after ten years.  There, he takes care of the suitors in a most sanguinary way, in concert with his son, and reclaims his place at the side of Penelope.  A sprawling story, with a terrific translation by Fagles.  This is a welcome addition to one's library. 
 The late Harry V. Roberts and Mr. Sergesketter have written an outstanding book.  Intended in part as an introduction for managers to how quality improvement programs FEEL for workers, it does much more.  It is an introduction to systematic self-improvement for those looking for provable results.    The approach is simple.  It starts with the "Personal Quality Checklist", an idea that goes back at least as far as Benjamin Franklin.  The goal is to eliminate defects and reduce cycle times on repetitive personal processes.  The means is systematic record-keeping.  The personal processes could be brushing one's teeth, being on-time for appointments, maintenance of an exercise program.  In other cases the focus might be on defects, such as saying "like" as an interjection in speech (as in, "I was, like, soooo bored, dude.") or fidgeting in class or at a meeting.  The book takes various ideas from the quality movement in industry and illustrates or suggests their application in personal processes.  I am sure that the very idea of this will upset some folks.  They probably aren't going to be persuaded.  But, if, like me, you are skeptical of most over-blown self-help books and courses, this modest, semi-scientific approach may be just the ticket for demonstrable, lasting self-improvement.  If it was good enough for Ben Franklin, ... 
 This is just the thing to put away for a Christmas gift.  Nice product in a nice box, tied with a bow. 
 I bought this book in 1970 when I had just started college. It is one of the few books I have kept for all these years and have re-read regularly.  The premise for the story is a young man, Si Morley, who joins a government program to go back in time to the NY of 1880's. The past is bought to life in a richly detailed and meticulously researched story.  Not only is it entertaining, containing romance and mystery, but it is also a commentary on how modernity has changed the city and its inhabitants something even more significant today.  This is a book you'll enjoy reading, one I can't recommend highly enough 
 Byron Barton's "My Car" was my 1-year-old grandson's first favorite and the first that he wore out.  I have re-ordered multiple copies for replacement purposes and also to use for gifts.  When he and his parents visited friends, their daughter hid the book and they had to look for it when it was time to leave.  So I ordered one for her, too!  Vona Van Cleef, El Paso, T 
 Der Fuehrer, by Konrad Heiden, published in 1944 by Houghton-Mifflin, is one of the best, if not the absolute best book I have read on Hitlers rise to power. From chapter one, "The Protocols of the Wise Men of  Zion", the only  history of this nefarious document's origin that I  have found, Heiden gives the most detailed background history of Germany  and the surrounding nations. His ability to take you from the end of WWI  into the turmoil and chaos of post-war Europe is unparalleled. Being German  and having lived through that time, he is able to impart an understanding  and a grasp of the forces pulling the German people into this malestrom of  uncertainty, desperation and chaos that brought the German people to such a  level of anxiety that they could readily embrace such a figure as Hitler.  For anyone interested in how one of the high cultures in Europe could  degenerate into madness in such a short time, this is a "must  read" 
 I enjoyed the book.  I especially like the way Momaday wrote the book as if it had been written by three people.  Not only did I learn about Momaday's journey to Rainy Mountain, but I also learned about Kiowa myths and legends.  It showed the last years of the Kiowas as a people. The book was simple to read, although when thought about, I realized it was more complex.  I would reccommend this book to people who like to learn about cultures and their myths 
 One can hardly think of a better author to take on the judicial activists. Phyllis Schlafly has been a dogged defender of freedom, and the matriarch of pro-family activism for four decades now. Both as a mother and a lawyer, she is well qualified to speak on how the tyranny of the courts is stamping out our freedoms and laying siege to our families.  Her thesis is simple. For the past fifty years liberal judges have moved beyond the strict interpretation of law to the creation of law. They have become legislators, and have sought to impose their leftist bias on the rest of the community. The rule of law has thus been replaced by the rule of judges: judges who are unelected and unaccountable, foisting their vision of the good society on a hapless citizenry.   Instead of viewing the US Constitution as a document that meant certain things by its authors, the activists speak of a "living and evolving Constitution" that can be taken to mean different things at different times. The original intent of the framers of the Constitution is jettisoned and trendy interpretations are read into the documents. The judges in fact are writing their own biased opinions into the law.  But the American system of government was meant to include a clear separation of powers. In addition to the judiciary, there was the legislative and the executive wings of government. Not only was the judiciary not meant to be in the business of creating laws, but it was also designed to be the least powerful of the three branches of government. Schlafly shows that in many ways it now has become the most powerful.  Indeed, this book shows that our judges have imposed taxes, dismantled laws that protect internal security, rewritten laws on the conduct of elections, and redefined the institution of marriage, to name but a few examples of judicial activism.   Moreover, they have invented so-called rights to such things as abortion, same-sex marriage, and public funding of pornography. As Schlafly rightly notes, such social and political policies should be made by our elected representatives, and not by our unelected judges.   Schlafly documents how this momentous change to our governance has come about. She notes that the infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857 really started the ball rolling on judicial tyranny. The Supreme Court made this pro-slavery decision by striking down a Federal law which forbade slavery in certain parts of America. Abraham Lincoln, the champion of emancipation, was appalled at the decision, and the attempt by the Court to make public policy.   Nearly one hundred years went by before a new bout of judicial activism erupted, this time under the Warren Court. Chief Justice Earl Warren wasted no time in asserting judicial supremacy, with a number of established laws overturned, and controversial social upheaval initiated, as in his challenges to school prayer and obscenity laws. The trends started by Warren have pretty much continued unabated during the past five decades.  Schlafly charts this half century of activism, with detailed chapters on such things as the courts' promotion of feminism, pornography, and its all-out assault on the institution of marriage. Concerning the latter, this book makes clear that both liberal judges and homosexual activists know that their agenda will never be implemented by the ballot box. The will of the people must be side-stepped by the use of judicial activism. Thus the war against marriage that we are now embroiled in.  In addition to various state judiciaries rejecting the will of the people on the marriage debate, the federal courts as well have waded into these debates. Justice Scalia has bemoaned the activism of his colleagues, saying they are making the Constitution and the nation unrecognisable.  Schlafy reminds us that homosexuals can marry just as anyone else can, but on the same terms. Everyone is equally banned from marriage because of certain age, relationship, and sex requirements. The truth is, most homosexuals do not want marriage. What they do want is full public acceptance and approval, and they are using the activist courts to achieve their aims.  Schlafy concludes this volume by offering some proposals to stop the judicial supremacists. These include allowing Congress to take its impeachment powers seriously, and to work to restore the balance of powers with its system of checks and balances. Above all, ordinary citizens must take an interest in the courts and court decision, becoming informed on how America was meant to be governed. They must become involved, and raise their voices about these unwelcome trends.  And this book serves as an important rallying cry to that end. In order for "we the people" to be truly sovereign, the warnings of this book need to be widely declared and heeded. 
 We were looking for a consultant to help us create a better customer care center.  We found Dan Coen and his book called Building Call Center Culture, and our management team has been using it to restructure our call center for several months now.  It's full of information that matter to call center management, and it is clear and easy to read.  Way to go 
 This dual-language book features twelve shortstories by 19th-century masters of Russian literature.  The pages are specially formatted with Russian Cyrillic on the left opposed by English translation on the right.  The Russian and English texts match eachother nearly line-for-line, simplifying cross-reference. Here is an entertaining way to enrich vocabulary and perfect syntax, for the intermediate to advanced student who already has the basics of grammar.  The editor chose some great examples of Russian writing, including Pushkin's haunting "Stationmaster", Gogol's grotesque "Nose", and Dostoevski's macabre graveyard drama "Bobok".  Only one thing detracts from the book's usefulness as a learning tool, which is that many of the phrases and expressions are somewhat archaic.  There are several dual-language compilations of contemporary (Soviet) shortstories available, for those who prefer to familiarize themselves with more modern language usage

 T.R. Fehrenbach's "This Kind of War" is the classic military history of the Korean War.  Fehrenbach addresses the strategic and operational aspects of the conflict, but much of his focus is on the tactical experience of U.S. units.  His book is a searing indictment of the U.S. military and of the United States for having failed to maintain combat-ready forces less than five years removed from the end of the Second World War.    The U.S. Army and Marine Corps elements thrust into sudden conflict in June 1950 following the communust invasion of the Republic of Korea had to relearn, the hard way, all the old and hard lessons of warfare.  Young soldiers who had been coddled by peacetime occupation duty in Japan found the battlefield to be a merciless place of death for those who were unprepared. In Fehrenbach's words "They were learning, in the hardest school there was, that it is a soldier's lot to suffer and that his destiny may be to die."   Fehrenbach's prose is blunt and straightforward; the narrative sketches the ancient truths of combat and their modern realities and pulls no punches with respect to the shortcomings of both the military and the political leadership.  Aging General Douglas McArthur ran great risks during the Battle of the Pusan Perimeter in August 1950 to husband forces for the spectacular September counterstroke at Inchon that turned the tide of combat, only to underestimate the risk of Chinese intervention and suffer an humiliating defeat inside North Korea in November.  In parallel manner, the Truman Administration made the hard political decision to intervene in June 1950, then failed to think through the likely implications of going north to the Chinese border in October 1950.     Fehrenbach dispenses credit where due.  The U.S. Eighth Army pulled itself together after its initial defeats to successfully defend South Korea, then reconstituted itself a second time after its defeat by the Chinese near the Yalu River.  It would persevere to the armistice in 1953.  Thousands of individual soldiers, NCO's, and officers overcame the shock of combat to become highly effective fighters, ultimately fighting far larger formations of Chinese and North Korean communists to a bloody standstill in the nation's first modern and rather unhappy experience with limited war.    This book is highly recommended to the student of the military art and of the Korean War.  Fehrenback's narrative provides a vivid reminder that we live in a world of tigers 
 I have just finished reading "Drug War" and can't say enough about the brilliance of this work. I hope it reaches a huge audience and I honestly believe it should be a core text for discussion in the classrooms of the world 
 This album is a classic, but its really short. Dead prez are the best duo in rap in my opinion. i highly recommend this and all of dead prez's other albums 
 a beautiful and intelligently written book that is actually printed on hemp paper ("This endpaper is 50-percent hemp/50-percent cotton paper") and with hemp-oil-based inks!!!  When you pick the book up, it actually feels more durable than many other books; and the cover is printed on recycled stock.  So the book really embodies the message, and the message is resounding: there are innovative and sound methods of growing this economy while working to protect the planet. There are wonderful black and white illustrations throughout.  The chapters are well-organized and highly informative.  I could have done without the cheesy "hemp model shot" on the back of the book, but it's not enough to avoid giving this marvelous book a five star rating! 
 If your a head banger you'll love this cd. Lot of good songs on it. 
 I read this book as a parent trying to figure out where to start because I wanted to teach my child how to read.  Blevins did a great job introducing ME to teaching phonics.    As a homeschooling parent, I feel like I am bombarded with kits and programs that guarantee to teach reading through phonics, but it seems like a lot of these are not very useful stuff marketed by people who seem a lot more attached to political ideologies rather than the mechanics of what works.  By contrast, Blevins writes from the standpoint of an educator rather than an ideologue, which I appreciated.  I must admit, however, that I haven't come even close to following Blevins advice on teaching.  It's much too obtuse for our purposes, which is learning to read, simply put 
 Decca's account of her eccentric family is every bit as moving and funny as I had hoped. You can't beat the Mitfords in the "fact-is-stranger-than-fiction" category. Decca proves a formidable storyteller and great wit 
 I thought that Supernatural would just be another Sci-Fi thriller, but then I started watching it and was surprised to discover that there is real plot line and character development. I think this show is wonderful and would recommend it to everyone 
 This is an excellent book EXPLAINING matters of colored pencil.  It's a wonderful "how to" book and you won't find a great CP artist that Kullberg.  However, I'm one of those people she elludes to in this book about her first book and the misunderstandings developed from it.  Many people thought that non-human objects in CP would be created just as she outlined in her first book.  They aren't!  Obviously, the misunderstanding was quite a problem or it would have taken up so much real estate in this second book.   Nevertheless, she is giving and generous in her approach to sharing her passion in this work.  Most people familiar with Ann Kullberg will own both books anyway so, it's just a matter of some unfortunate re-arranging and adjustment.  That said, this book is proof that even the most humble of artistic instruments become tools of art on the walls in Heaven from a master's hand.  Ann is that Master with Colored Pencil.  One item not covered in the book is that the thoughts and concepts here in CP do somewhat transfer to the world of Acrylics.  She wouldn't be the first CP artist to discover this but, I believe if she did, she would soon become the best. Of all the Italian Masters, she reminds me most of Leonardo Divinci with her vent on translucent layering.  Not a bad idea, adapting the techniques of someone like that.  You should own this book.  I even bought the products she recommends and I've been WOWed!  Now, that rarely happens.  Good book, good teacher... can't go wrong.      
 From beginning to end, this album is great! His 2000 debut was solid and had some good songs throughout. Dutty Rock was OK but not spectacular although it did wonders for his career and brought him out to the mainstream audience. I found songs from that CD like "Like Glue" and "I'm Still In Love With You" and even "Gimme The Light" after hearing it a thousand times to be weak and very annoying and got on my last nerve hearing them so much.   However, "The Trinity," has no bad songs at all and is perfect from start to finish. Unlike Dutty Rock, I've repeated listening to this CD many times now and I'm still not sick of it which shows how good it is and how great it is to see Sean Paul go back to his Jamaican roots and stop trying to please the mainstream with cameos galore like he did on Dutty Rock. I also like the fact that all the lyrics are included, I wish all artists did that, but with Dancehall is even better to have the words, cause sometimes you just don't know what they are saying.  This album is great all around. 
 Gord Wilson (below) asks what happened to this. Well, the reprint edition doesn't include it. I asked Michael AWB if he could put the intro online, and he has:  michaelswanwick[dot]com/nonfic/duck[dot]html  I haven't actually seen the book, so my rating (required by Ammie) is the average of the other 2 reviews.

 This is a short, easy to read book, intended to give some advice to young couples contemplating marriage.  This slow reader began and finished the book within a couple hours, but the length of time reading the book does not reflect how useful the book is.  Some of Dobson's main points are:  keep Christ as the center of your relationship (Dobson being an evengelical Christian, writing to others who strongly value Christ); make sure you see eye-to-eye on the big things and be prepared to get into big fights about little things; men and women think differently and it would benefit you greatly to learn the way the other sex thinks.  Dobson writes in a fluid style and liberally sprinkles in anecdotes, research, and selections from others' works to make his points.  In doing this, he makes his main points stand out and makes his book a fun, lighthearted one written about a subject that is anything but light.  Recommended 
 When I first picked this book up, I read the first few pages and almost put down.  I was put off by the obvious Star Trekisms.  However, I stuck with it, and I'm very glad I did.  The reader can see the influence of Star Trek through out the book, but the author is talented enough so the reader soon forgets to notice them.  Even if you're not a huge SciFi fan, you will find the characters engaging and well written.  The plot is different than other SciFi efforts I've read and is so well, the book is hard to put down.  One warning, however.  Keep a box of Kleenex nearby as you near the 320 page mark.  You'll need it.  Over all, another excellent book from a very talented writer 
 .....who never really liked cooking. She actually received this gift from co-workers as a joke! Recently, while visting her city, I spent several days with her and she decided to show off her new cooking skills, telling me that I'd be the "guinea pig". With this she held up her copy of Cooking for Dummies and explained how she came to possess it. This book starts very simply apparently, explaining such things as the difference between "boil" and "broil" and how to tell if meat is cooked. It's perfect for those who've really never done a day of cooking in their lives or those who are still in the fairly early stages of learning cooking basics. It proceeds slowly until the point where the reader is actually ready to put together a dish and can follow the book's recipes. Well, my cousin wowed me over the next several days and really put together some quite tasty meals! I recommend this book for all novice cooks!!! If she can do it, you can too!! 
 THIS STORY MOVED ME DEEPLY.  I FELT HIS PAIN AND LONLINESS 
 This is without doubt one of the best history books written in the twentieth century. A work of great depth and breadth, it shows a master historian at his best. The analysis is rich and complex; just about every  page is rich with insight and often turns upside down some old conventional  wisdom (cf., for but one example, his assessement of the positive role the  Vikings had on the redistribution of wealth and on economic quickening in  general in Europe). This is a veritable tour de force, and one that should  be required reading for anyone seriously interested in medieval history. Of  course, some material is dated, and on some topics the author changed his  mind later on in his career, but that does not detract from the force and  brilliance of this classic

 this book has been of utmost help to me, since I've been working on my degree essay, which concerns the symbol of the bee in the poetry of Pindar, Theocritus and Callimachus.

 The world lost a real gem of a writer when Stan Berenstain passed on November 29.  Together, Berenstain and his wife, Jan, and eventually their two sons, created books featuring lovable but flawed characters who tackle just about every real issue that faces families.    Going to the dentist is something that most kids (and adults!) fear.  And why not?  It's invasive, uncomfortable, and sometimes painful to have someone poking around in your mouth with metal objects.  However, it's necessary, and having a healthy attitude about it will promote lifelong oral health.  This book is a great place to start if you're looking to help alleviate your child's fear about going to the dentist.  It'll help open up a dialogue about your kid's fears and help you to explain why the dentist is so important.  Wonderful 
 This nice book contains many things that every mathematics student should know (but don't). Chapters 1-2 are on Euclid. The main ideas are picked out very nicely, in welcome contrast to the usual "let ABCD..."-style books. Chapters 3-4 on linear algebra in geometry will probably be skimmed by most readers. This is perhaps just as well, since it consists of little more than the pearls from the usual linear algebra course and since the presentation feels somewhat forced (e.g., things like the inner product are cheerfully defined out of thin air) compared to how naturally the rest of the book flows. Chapters 5-6 on projective geometry are more interesting. Perspective in art sets the stage, but we quickly move to purer things. Stillwell is very fond of the mysterious and fascinating connection with hypercomplex number systems one obtains by building up an arithmetic from within a projective plane. Then in chapter 7 we learn that transformation groups are a clarifying and unifying idea, and we play around with them a bit, somewhat aimlessly it seems, until we finally get to hyperbolic geometry in chapter 8. This chapter crowns the whole book beautifully, showing how projective geometry explodes into hyperbolic geometry through transformation-group thinking. It ends with an excellent short survey of the history of non-Euclidean geometry 
 This book was, frankly, a revelation to me. Naguib Mahfouz is the only Arab author to ever win a Nobel Prize for literature, and it's easy to see why he won, if you base your judgement on this volume. This book is a compilation of his best-known and best-regarded work, three books which together are referred to as the Cairo Trilogy. Originally, the author had planned the whole work as a single novel, but after he finished it the publisher told him that a 1300 page novel wasn't possible in the 1950's Arab world, so they split it into three separate novels, with the original title of the whole book serving as the title for the first of the three novels: Palace Walk. Palace of Desire follows it, and Sugar Street concludes the trio.  Mahfouz is a remarkable writer. The book spans 30 years at the beginning of the 20th Century, in Cairo of course, and follows the lives of an extended family during this time. He spends an enormous amount of time at the beginning of the book establishing character and setting. The opening 100 or so pages follow the various members of the family through a single day in their lives, starting with the mother getting up to start the day, and following in turn her, her husband, and their children as they perform various tasks during the day. The narrative then takes off and follows these individuals through various calamities (one of the sons gets killed in a demonstration, the father is briefly pressed into service to help with fortification construction, and so forth). He reserves judgement as far as the characters are concerned, tells you how they rationalize their actions when they do something less than perfect, and lets the reader see the warts of each of the characters individually.  This is a long, involved, carefully written book. Frankly it invites comparison with almost any other epic novel that covers a generation or two like this, and it's actually better than more than a few of them. It also has, as a sidelight, insight into the character of the nation of Egypt, its people, and especially it spends a great deal of time discussing the character of the city, who lives their, and their attitude towards their neighbors. It's intensely interesting, frankly pretty well written (the translation is very easy to read) and I enjoyed it a great deal 
 This is the first of R.J's books I have ever read, and because of it I am hooked to Sci-Fi (my mother now hates RJ because of it) I wont tell you this is one of those oh-my-gosh-it's-already-three AM books, because it's not. It took me two months to finish this book, and I'm not a slow reader. I first started reading this book, and was clueless as to what was going on, so I stopped reading. Then two months later, I had no books to read. So I opened New Spring again, and I loved it!!  For those of you first time R.J. readers, READ THIS BOOK FIRST. It might be a bit confusing in the beginning, but as it goes on it explains so much. It gives you an insight on some of the characters true personalities. It show's Morien as a fun, loving, young, mischievous women. Instead of a high strung, mysterious, know-it-all. This book explains so much that the first 11 WOT, keeps hidden.   For all you long term R.J. readers, you should read this book then reread the whole WOT series, believe me, it's worth it!   The characters in this book are very well developed and the plot line fresh and unlike most books I've read.  But I still have a few bones to pick.  First of all it starts off with a character that you don't see again till the 13 chapter, so your jut wondering what was the point in that. Then after the first you see no real action till chapter 9. I gave the book a 5 star because even with all it faults it was an amazing book, and I have never read a book where there is nothing to fault. 
 These sandals are OK. 4 star quality of material which makes it pretty good, but the size system is completely off, so that makes me want to put it as 3 stars. I'm an 8, but i ordered a 7 and i still have some room to spare. I wish i could send it back and receive a 6 but too much work, and i guess i'll just deal.  **I feel that maybe a 6 would give me a firm size (one where theres somewhat no squirming ability), so thats why i decided to stick with a 7. I hope that this "size review" helps out a bit with your choice of size.**  If youre ordering these sandals be prepared to take one size down or two or else you'll feel foolish with such big sandals.  Besides that, the shape and form of the sandal is quite nice. Its quite comfortable, because after all it is a licensed birkenstock. Plus the price is right compared to the other birkenstocks. Thats why its moved up to 4 stars 
 Sor Juana's Second dream, by Alicia Gaspar de Alba, is a must-read text by anyone who is interested in the major figure from Colonial Latin America, Sor (Sister) Juana Inés de la Cruz. I have taught for many years about the life and work of this Mexican nun, and never before has a work of historical fiction captured what I believe renders a true portrait of Sor Juana. Most works of the past, even academic ones, have avoided addressing Sor Juana's personal life; in Sor Juana's Second Dream, we see, as we should, an anguished personal experience that appears in many of Sor Juana's most famous texts. Bravo!  Well done 
 I've read other books by Don Colbert,MD so I knew I would enjoy this one, but I got much more out of it than I expected.  For a small book it is loaded with easy to understand and excellent information that I was able to put to work in my life right away.  It gave me hope that now finally I can really lose weight.  Thank you DR.Colber 
 These stories don't mess around, they get ferocious and sometimes even worse; that's what makes them so good. Don't worry about sleep, you'll want to keep reading. If it'll make you feel better, keep a weapon handy - just try not to get jumpy at noises that seem louder than usual.. 
 Speaking for myself, I get sick when I hear "CNN, The Most Trusted News," and watch Fox and every other mind-melted American media. I have to admit, I also get nauseated (literally) in just the sight of G.W. Bush or any of his administration attempting to tell the "truth." And what's even more disturbing are the supporter's; Blind and angry fighters with bias moral slants and empty slogans. On the other hand, PBS and Comedy Central are refreshing alternative exceptions to all of these deceptions.  Chomsky relates two types of democracy - one where the majority of people are politically active participants, heard, listened and considered. The other, which is what we have, is a vanguard or specialized class of representatives that do the voicing for everyone - the only participation of the public during their elections. And this is what has been both in Lenin's and U.S. liberal's idea; that of a specialized vanguard political and business class endorsed to protect the bewildered public who simply can't think for themselves. In this, modern U.S. propaganda had its beginning with Woodrow Wilson's Creel Commission and later Red Scare.   While former tactics used have been the Creel Commission and the Red Scare, attacks are still used unions and all political organizations with the separating and isolating of people; distracting them with consumerism, TV sitcoms and the Superbowl - to name only a few. Also the use of catchy and empty phrases as "Do you support the," and "Are you for or against." This is used along with many superficial forms of entertainment, gossip columns, sporting events and many other diversions. The bottom line is a One party system, a One business system, with two divisions of the same party - the Democrats and Republicans.  While these distractions and attacks on unions and political organizations have been very successful, they have not broken up the Churches, which act as the few places left for organization and political speeches against propaganda. An example is the recognition that war is wrong, while the government calls those against the Vietnam War part of a Vietnam syndrome, weak and sickly persons.  You name it - the Middle East, Central America, National terrorism - it's all been lied upon by our media and governmental official history, including the number killed in Vietnam, declaring less than a million Vietnamese, while other sources reveal millions. What do we think when other countries and groups lie about the amount of people murdered in the Holocaust?  It was only until the 1960's that the culture awakened unlike before. Even in highly prejudice and opinionated parts of the country, open talks can now be given. Where formerly there was both the lack of understanding and opposition, now there is still opposition but with much more understanding and at least some type of semi-organizational national movements despite all the media propaganda.  In our recent times with unemployment raised, lower wages, loss of health care affordability, dwindling social security, and much more poverty than before, the sitcoms, consumerism and the Superbowl are not enough. The tactics needed are to continually create new enemies to fight, new terror to control and general fear within the public; as in Saddam Hussein, Bin Laden, Castro, Quadhafi, drug traffickers, Arabs - all with our magnificent military force that wipes out these supposed tyrannies - in reality they are weak third world armies - all acting as distractions and diversions from the real truth; U.S. imperialism and abuse of labor and natural resources by the few powerful and wealthy. Cuba is likely to be next. In an effort to gain control over labor and natural resources and prevent economic independence, the strategy is to first provoke them. And then when they act under defense, they are set-up under the lie of offence as reported by the media, demanding that we defend and brilliantly crush them under patriotic morals and values. "God Bless America." Now we can all relax with a sigh of relief now that this terrible dictatorial tyranny has been eliminated and decent human rights and values have been restored.  9. While the media widely publicized the jail and torture of the former Cuban prisoner, Armando Valladares, and the U.S. both commending him for his courage and then appointing him as a representative of the UN human rights commission, a much more detailed, mountainous evidence of signed affidavits of human rights commission members in El Salvador imprisoned and tortured by the U.S., and acquired by Hebert Anaya were entirely ignored by the media. Only one small blurb mentioned. And when finally released from prison, he was quietly assassinated by U.S. backed security forces.   People who were polled responded against countries that occupy others illegally and perform human rights abuses. And yet all over the globe, both the U.S. and U.S. backed forces do just that, an example being the U.S. backed invasion, torture and killings of Indonesia to those in East Timor, killing over 200,000, while the media remains silent. And while Israel occupies Lebanon illegally against UN resolution 425, with U.S. backing, killing over 20,000 in Beirut, hospitals and vital centers, there is no media coverage.  Over the years, the media refused to report to the public the critical voices of the Iraqi democrats around the world since they condemned the U.S. friendly relations with Saddam Hussein. Only after Saddam became the enemy were their voices given any coverage. But no sooner did they voice their antiwar sentiments and opinion against imperialistic maneuvers; they were again completely ignored by the media. You can only read about them in some of the German and British press. What does this say of our democracy?  Chomsky gives the reasons U.S. gave for the Gulf War; Aggressors can not be rewarded and must be reversed by violence. And yet the U.S. does this all the time and no one questions their aggressions, as in their 20 years of quiet diplomacy (no attack) of South Africa's killings, 1.5 million in just the Bush-Reagan years. Again no media coverage, a hallmark sign of a totalitarian and bias culture.  While two-thirds of Americans polled favored peace negotiations with Iraq, the media continued to drill the government's view of no diplomacy. Meanwhile Iraq had offered total withdrawal, and again no coverage. Any who thought of negotiations were made to feel like oddballs since the media shows that no one thinks this way. And no Democrat dared speak up either.  While the U.S. blocks sanctions against Israel for her defying the UN in illegally occupying Lebanon since 1978, it hypocritically employs sanctions against Cuba and Iraq. And these have worked, weakening Iraq tremendously. Negotiations are offered by Iraq, but Bush refuses for the same economic exploitative reasons in a small country torn by a war with Iran. And now suddenly it is a dangerous power that threatens the entire world with lies about stockpiles of chemical weapons and WMD. The same exact tactics were used only a year earlier on Nicaragua's Manual Noriega, deceptively elevated to a large and dangerous drug trafficking threat to the world. But he had to be smashed, killing hundreds, maybe thousands of people, and restoring a vicious police state. History repeats itself.   It's all about whether we want a pseudo democracy of representatives and servitude or a free democracy of active citizen participation. These are our choices 
 There is little I can add to all the wonderful reviews that have covered this book. It is a wonderful peak inside monastic life, and the impact that the monastic lifestyle/worldview has upon a soul. Highly recommended 
 In the past, my experience in reading Emerson has been similar to reading the Tao Te Ching; interesting, non-mainstream in its point of view, puzzling to understand what exactly it means. So I would pick up the Tao and read it at different times of the day and different frames of mind, hoping that it would resonate with me, but it never did. Maybe it was the cultural difference, or the language, or not being able to easily identify with Lao Tzu. Such had been my experience with Emerson. I wanted to understand him better because what little I did understand made me want to learn more, but I just couldn't get there.  This biographer, Richardson, really did his homework and any who want to understand Emerson better should appreciate this work. Emerson kept exhaustive journals and collections of his thoughts for many years. He read widely and deeply, kept detailed notes, and thoroughly indexed the notes. What perfect material to access for writing a biography!  Apparently Richardson went back and studied much of the source material that Emerson references in his journals and brings into this biography an understanding of who Emerson was reading and what it meant to Emerson, so we receive the pleasure of following along on a journey in the development of a powerful mind. Then Richardson is able to write about this development so that it is easily readable to us moderns. It's quite a remarkable achievement.   "Mind on Fire" shows me that Richardson is certain that studying Emerson and his message is worthwhile. So much consideration has gone into this biography that when I laid it down after almost non-stop reading for several days over the holidays, I felt like I really understood Emerson for the first time, and now have much better insight. I plan to let this book simmer in my mind a few more months, then pick it up and read it again.  If Richardson could also write something as lucid and detailed to help me understand the Tao Te Ching, I wouldn't have 10,000 questions about the 10,000 things. ;-)  
 I really loved this book. It has a truly magical quality to it, and I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read her next book. Thank you to a great author and storyteller. It is a great book to take traveling especially for those long waits at the airport or train station. Time just flies by 
 The Diabetic Athlete was exactly what I was looking for. It describes the effects different sports and activities have on blood sugar and your body. Also, provides tables and advice on how to manage your glucose levels depending on sport and type of insulin being used. Great reference and easy reading 
 There is something in this book for everyone -- including all fields of nonfiction AND fiction.  It is just a good book on writing well.  If you are a writer, I recommend spending $10 to read through this.  If there is nothing new -- this would surprise me -- then it is a great review of topics on writing well.  This is an excellent companion for those who have read Strunk and White.  This is especially true for college students who are going to have to start writing essays.  You won't be disappointed 
 I've seen Stephen Lynch live, in this Comedy Central special, and heard his audio cds.  Live is by far the best experience but this video is a close second.  The live audience really enhances the experience.  This is some truly funny stuff 
 This is a fantastic reference for people interested in working as a medical interpreter. The information presented is practical, well-organized, and addresses the impact of culture on health care. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a valuable self-training manual 
 I run an ad agency. This book was handed to me. I read it in an hour. I'm handing it to my creative director in the morning so he can spend an hour with it and hand it to every one in our creative department. It's that kind of book. 
 How did I ever live withouth this little baby? Lots of power, easy to handle, super easy clean up. I use it fo reverything from making smoothies to pureeing soups, to chopping nuts. Great purchase. I won't be buying a new food processor after all 
 Dr. Thurley has done a great job with this reference book. A great addition to anyone's personal reference library on Tudor history 
 I've been trying to learn the basics of watercolor from books and DVDs with little success until now.  Her explanations and demonstrations are very detailed and have given me a base to work from and build on.  I've learned so much about watercolor from this DVD and I'm having so much fun playing with the techniques and concepts presented in the DVD. 
 This is a great 2 disk set.  I am sitting here drinking a heineken and blasting this super loud.  I feel like I am marching into town with 2 briefcases jammed full of big bills. I highly recommed this. [...] 
 This compilation of  40 accounts by the parents, spouses, children, and friends of transgendered individuals (and a few TG themselves) describes reactions from family members as they take the road less traveled toward acceptance of their gender variant relative or friend.  Each story is brief - usually only a few pages - but expresses the thoughts and experiences of the individual author.  The book is edited by the Chair of the PFLAG Transgender Network, Mary Boenke, MSSA, MA, and mother of an adult FTM transgendered son 
 this is a good cd.  i was worried i might not like it, but it's good.  esp 5, 6, 11... but also pretty much all the rest except for 4... 
 This book has greatly impacted me. The idea of surrender, sacrifice and relying on God's Holy Spirit for direction (Prov 3:5-6..) I would recommend this book to anyone. With bits of humour in the beginning to the amazing choices that Rees makes which cause you to reflect on the strength of your own faith. 
 This is where the genius started his famous reputation and talent. If had not been for his wife (she saved the original manuscript), we probably woud not have the 1976 classic or anything else King related. Everyone shoud give this start of King's genius a look 
 over all a good gift for children but I feel that maybe you could have added few peices of paper. Thank 
 First of all, I'd like to say that at this point, it doesn't matter if Mumia is guilty or innocent because the fact is, in this country we have something called Procedural Law, which mandates that if certain rules and guidelines are abused in a criminal trial, the case/charges at hand should be dropped. That is precisely what happend in Mumia's case. If you read this book (or any article about Mumia for that matter,) it's clear that the rights afforded to any prisoner were violated in his case and that the violations of procedure were so great that his case should be dropped and he should be freed, regardless of anything else.  Having said that, here is the book review. If you're looking for musings on the day-to-day existence of any given prisoner in any state or federal prison in the country, this is where to look. In addition to that, if you're looking for some interesting and rather shocking statistics regarding racial disparity in the justice system as a whole, espeically the death penalty (even though they are over a decade old, they are even more bleak today,) then this book is where to look. Reading this book forces one to question the validity, necessity, and practicality of the death penalty in this country as juxtaposed to other countries. Upon completion (actually way before that) of this book, you can't help but feel for Mumia and the way he has been treated by the nation that proclaims itself to be the model that other countries of the world should strive to immitate--OUR country.  Finally, I recommend this book to anyone interested at all by the undeniable fact of racial prejudice in the justice system. While this book reads like a collection of essays and journal entires, because that's what it is, if you're looking for a non-fiction account of the death penalty and death row in a novelized form, look into Dead Man Walking by Helen Prejean. Either way, Live from Death Row will open your eyes... and your heart. 
 I liked the story line. It's something that you've heard before and thought would be perdictable but wasn't really that perdictable at the end. There were plot twists and action that I would not have thought would happen. It was a very good listen! 
 This is an example of an overlooked classic and brilliant morality tale. This story is very funny and very perceptive. This is an automatic read. If you see this, just make yourself read it. You will never forget the truths of the human condition in America that Steinbeck relays to us. I'm looking forward to the day that America starts paying attention to the least of us and values diversity. You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one 
 Of all the recent teen romantic comedies, I think this one is my favorite.  "10 Things" is (losely) based on Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew."  The movie is about Kat (the Shrew) who is a anti social outsider.  Unfortunately her younger and more popular sister Bianca cannot date until Kat starts dating.  Various suitors of Bianca's conspire to free her by hiring the school bad boy Patrick to date Kat.  I love the fact that both the lead characters are somewhat outsiders in high school, rather than following usual story arc for a teen romance where at least one of the leads is part of the "in crowd."  The character of Kat is also very refreshing.  She is a strong willed and feminist, but remains sexy and human rather than a Hollywood sterotype.     I also loved the setting of the movie in Seattle, Washington.  What a departure from the vast majority of teen movies which usually take place in California!  I especially like the school where the film was shot, which is a real High School in Tacoma.  Compared to where I went to high school, the school in this film is absolutely sureal and it definately gives a certain feeling of fantasy to the movie.  Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles are perfect as the leads.  Both were very young when this movie was filmed, but you could tell then they had talent and would go far.  Julia Stiles really impresses with her ability to be sexy, strong and even vulnerable all at the same time.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  Larisa Olenik gives a great performance as the beautiful and naive Bianca.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Cameron, the boy who will do anything for Bianca. I also liked Andrew Keegan as the vain and vapid Joey who also is after Bianca, but for less than honorable reasons.  The movie does have some cliche's of the teen comedy genre, but the story is surprisingly clever and engaging, the characters are charming, and the setting in Seattle is fantastic and fresh.  I highly recommend "10 Things I Hate About You."    
 This is a must have if you like rock and roll, rockabilly, swing, or  anything good 
 I love the way she sings and the gift of her voice touches me deep within my soul. She speaks my language 
 I agree it's a waste to get sizes you don't need. Here's an idea to do a public exchange. I do not need the large and medium, and will be glad to give to anyone, just for the postage. I just need the small sizes. 
 Ayers is brilliant!  I could not put the book down!  In his characteristic style (from "Worldwatch") Ayers paints a clear picture of the dangerous place we are headed (if not already there) -a world that will  require a collective concentrated focus on mitigation of the effects of the  four megaphenomena (see above), and a reversal of those trends, if our  species is to survive.  This book is not for the light-hearted.  If you  have the slightest shade of "green" in your soul, this book will  give you a paradigm shift that will change your life.  If you don't, you  will 
 This book is a must-have for anyone writing a college level or above paper.  I've found that it's better used as a reference, not as the kind type of book you sit down and read.  One warning, it is a manual, so it's pretty dry - dry, but necessary 
 I don't really feel like writing a lot but I do want to say that I love this album. I was very skeptical about a Rihanna album. I didn't buy her first one because I figured all her songs would sound like "Mr. DJ". I wasn't going to buy this one because i assumed all her songs would sound like SOS (I liked SOS, but I don't want to hear it over and over again). Unfaithful, Girl Like Me, this album is hot! Rihanna did her thing 
 This suit is put together very well... Since the great-grandson has a daddy as a marine.. lol    Great-grandpa is a navy man. Thanks. Love it 
 For its length and breadth, I'd recommend this little book to most people.  I teach a course on Logic, and even I learned a bit from this short introduction.  The worry, however, is that Priest takes this book as an opportunity to push his own non-standard view on formal logic, which is why a better title for this book would be `A short Introduction to Priest's Logic'.    Most immediately evident is that Priest uses many of the chapters as a place to show how an argument for the existence of god.  For example, much of the chapter on predicate logic is devoted to showing the fallacy inherent in the cosmological argument for the existence of god.  His chapter on decision theory is in part devoted to showing how Pascal's wager goes wrong.  Probably even more subversive is that, in an introductory level logic book, Priest presents his own unorthodox solutions to paradoxes in logic.  For example, to solve the problem of self-reference, he presents his own view regarding four valued logics, without even a word explaining that not only is this not the standard view, it's not even a very popular one.  He also offers fuzzy logic as a solution of vagueness and sorites paradoxes.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and would offer it to any friend interested in a brief introduction to some advanced topics in logic.  But I'll be sure to emphasize that much of what he offers for solutions is hardly accepted by mainstream analytic philosophy.  Priest took advantage of this chance to write an introductory level text as an opportunity to push his own views, and anyone reading this should be aware of this fact before beginning 
 When London reporter Edward Malone is spurned by his beloved Gladys for not being "manly", he seeks to prove his valor by signing onto an expedition with the eccentric Professor George Edward Challenger.  Challenger, a zoologist, is notorious among British naturalists as an evil-tempered, arrogant nut.  For it is Challenger's contention that on a plateau in South America, animals long thought extinct, including dinosaurs, still thrive.    Most people know Arthur Conan Doyle as the creator of Sherlock Holmes.  However, thanks to Michael Crichton's homage, many people are familiar with Doyle's first Professor Challenger novel, "The Lost World."  In this novel, Doyle was clearly seeking to distance himself from his most famous character, creating a more fantastic world, as well as creating a protagonist built on volatile emotion as he is on reason.  "The Lost World" is in many ways typical of turn-of-the-century English science-fiction.  The team of explorers is generally archetypal, including the Challenger's crotchety opponent Professor Summerlee, the sportsman Lord John Roxton, the bull-headed Challenger, and the self-conscious Malone.  The plot runs on a serious of thrills and contrivances, as the heroes discover the plateau, but are stranded their by vindictive natives.  While in this lost world, they encounter various dinosaurs (from the Jurassic period), primitive ape-men, and modern Indians.  Each adventure is harrowing and stirring, as they are attacked by pterodactyls, allosaurs, and the ape-men.    Naturally, there are aspects of the book that will seem dated.  Our knowledge of dinosaurs has expanded in the century since this book was published.  Further, certain condescending attitudes are expressed about race and gender.  Finally, while Doyle had a better ear for dialog than some of his contemporaries, much of his dialog is still fairly stilted.    That having been said, the book is thoroughly enjoyable beyond its status as an artifact.  While Challenger never overshadowed Holmes as Doyle had intended, the character has found his own niche in science-fiction.  "The Lost World" is an important work in speculative fiction, entertaining and surprisingly timeless. 
 A very good book. Better than Nancy Drew's to my opinion my hypothosis to what was going on changed continuesly and finally at the end I settled on one. It also teaches alot about London and such. The book isn't that far out of real life so it could really happen which to me makes it all the better. A good book 
 The bridge between "Hell Awaits" and "De Mysteriis dom Satanas" - listen to this and awaken to the dawn of black metal. 
 If you are a fan of Robert A. Heinlein, and have read most of his works, then I reccommend this book unceasingly to you. It has 200+ pages of never-before-published Heinlein fiction (as well as the short title story - one of the man's best, and the one that also shot him to fame.) These include two novellas: Tenderfoot In Space - written for Boy's Life, and Destination: Moon - Heinlein's story version that would lead to the script and movie of the same name. Also included are two stories he wrote for girls (!), his remembrance of the filming of Destination Moon, a short poem, and the text of three speeches he made at the World Science Fiction Convention, where he was Guest of Honor an unprecented three times. Also included is are the proceedings of NASA's Heinlein Expedition, where he received (posthumously) their Distinguished Public Service Medal, their highest civilian honor awarded. This includes a reading of his inspirational piece "This I Believe" (which I had read at a local meeting of ours) by his wife, Virginia Heinlein, and several short speeches by such people as Tom Clancy and Jerry Pournelle. The heart of the book for many, though, will be the third section, in which many of Heinlein's famous contemporay writers (as well as an editor and a Navy colleague) write their remembrances of the man. It's very poignant and humbling to see world-famous writers speaking of Heinlein in such highly reverent terms - almost as if they were speaking of God Himself. This goes some way towards showing what an incredible man Heinlein was, and what a tremendous influence he had on the field of science fiction. To see Arthur C. Clarke himself - the only writer, along with Asimov, who you'll ever see mentioned in the same breath as the Grand Master - waxing rememeric on the man is a testament to RAH's vision and integrity. Poul Anderson's piece is particularly memorable. Larry Niven contributes the only fiction piece (a small masterpiece, incorporating Heinlein as a major character), and the long defense of Heinlein by Spider Robinson makes for extremely interesting reading. This is an absolute must-read for anybody who considers themselves a Heinlein fan. It's an incredible book, and shows what an incredibly tremendous influence had on the field of SF, and on the 20th century in general. I gladly put it on my bookshelf, and I'm not afraid to admit - as Arthur C. Clarke does in a blurb on the cover - that I cried while reading it 
 I'm pretty finicky about Christmas albums.  I hate most of them.  This one is probably in my top 5, and I'm not even much of an Amy Grant fan.  It's one of those extremely rare Christmas albums by a popular artist that actually sounds like Christmas.  The arrangements are very traditional without being boring, and even the nontraditional songs fit in very well and aren't too "pop-y". Amy Grant's voice is perfectly suited to this kind of music and she knows how to sing a wonderful song and just let its natural beauty speak for itself.  I shudder to think of this same set of songs mutilated by Christina Aguilera's relentless moans and gratuitous runs.  The bottom line:  you could put this CD on in July and it would bring visions of snowy lamp-lit streets, sleigh rides, mall Santas, manger scenes, and people being inexplicably kind to one another.  And that's the way it should be.  I'm talking to you, Ms. Aguilera 
 Especially if you are older and ttc, please buy this book!  It will give you so much hope and information!  It explains all the reasons why acupuncture, having a natural, healthy diet and lifestyle, and taking herbs will help you find better health--and help you get pregnant!  PLEASE do not think twice about buying this book.  I have recommended it to many of my friends and they have all gotten so much out of it.  You will, too!  Get it, you will not be dissapointed 
 Great book!!!!!!  Lots of great information about how the media works.......also the real story of Nazism and Pan-Germanism  
 "The Andromeda Strain" may be an antique in science fiction, having been published in 1969, but that hardly diminishes its excellence.  The caliber of Michael Crichton's research is such that I still found the technology and science in the book impressive (though the computers were obviously dated) despite the book's age.  The plotline is thrilling, and though some of the scientific and philosophic asides are lengthy, most are equally fascinating.  I was slightly disappointed by the ending; however, the rest of the book was amazing and made the reading worth it 
 1)  Buy the cd. 2)  When you get it, put in in the cd player and hit "play"  If you don't like it, damn it, it's not for you.  PS:  That's all I had to do.  One of their best releases 
 This the fifth book I've read on traveling in Borneo, and in certain ways it rivals my favorite (Eric Hansen's "A Stranger in the Forest").  O'Hanlon is not only literate and well-informed on the subject (Borneo), but he's one of those highly-educated writers who doesn't take himself (or his elderly, unathletic) traveling companion (a famous poet) too seriously.  The screamingly funny parts are when O'Hanlon is either making fun of himself sweating like a pig, covered with flies and falling down or up one muddy trail or another while his Borneo native guides are laughing themselves silly at his ineptness.  O'Hanlon is fat and out-of-shape and his small, powerfully strong, local guides never let him forget it for a minute!    O'Hanlon is able to describe characters so well, one feels as if you are on the boat with them; the three guides are lovingly drawn (unlike other travel writers who don't view their local guides as complete people).    For those with an interest in the ecology of Borneo, birds, or river journeys, there is much to learn through this engrossing read.  I recently saw a documentary that filmed the "remote" areas where O'Hanlon's journey took place and I am sad to say it has been totally deforested by the Indonesian timber industry; huge corporations that are destroying the Borneo rainforest due to graft and a lack of enforcement by the Indonesian goverment... Subjects that O'Hanlon writes about in this book.  Think twice about buying teak furniture, much of it comes from poached wood that is illegally cut from Borneo's rainforest, a sad coda to this funny book 
 i thought this was a good cheat book and it was really descriptive, even though there were a few typos...the game was also good as wel 
 I found this book very enjoyable.Mr Rosenfeld using the writings of the Federalists shows their contempt of freedom and predeliction for order by surpressing dissent.Contrary to what reviewer David Randall believes about  Bache and Duane's love of the French Revolution and democracy,this book  rightly exposes the love of monarchy and it's forms by leading  federalists;Hamiltons's proposal during the constitutional convention for  an unlimited government and monarchy,Adam's love of titles and  aristocracy,and Washington's deification and support of the Alien and  Sedition acts,both violations of the very constitution he helped draft.The  book is biased,but biased in favor of a side of history seldom told.A story  of a battle for liberty of the press and constitutional government.Although  Mr Randall wants to deflect attention from the tyranny of Federalist  politicians,this book exposes them through they're own words and  deeds.Overall a brilliant book 
 These earrings are very small, maybe somewhere between 3 and 4mm each. They do appear white, (I don't see any yellow tinting)  with a slight, slight bit of grey, which I prefer over a super white look (as you might sometimes find in a cz). These earrings catch the light nicely, showing a bit of rainbow effect. They aren't super, super sparkly or faceted, but they do possess shine and detail. I am very happy with these earrings as they are just what I wanted: something petite and real, set in yellow gold, and with a nice, clean and "believably" sparkly look! I also like the fit of the earrings backs, very tight and secure. 
 Like Hazel Motes, the main character of this book, who in thoroughly seeking to deny Christ in every which way, only ends up affirming Christ in a resonant, disturbingly real and existential way, this book works the same for those who both like and dislike it. This book, as a whole work, speaks a WORD. Those who toss it aside as "boring" or "ingratiating" only affirm this.    When I first read it, I had the same "ingratiating" feeling for a while. One thought that definitely occured to me was that I had never read anything like it before. It doesn't seek to thrill, empower the emotions, or to bring any "explorations" of "social issues". It is so grounded in the very unpleasant falleness of a southern town, that the movements that occur therein take on a kind of universal importance and impact; right down the most immature of dirty deeds there is an ATTENTION in the writing, for want of a better word; the "town" seems to fade away and a larger stage takes its place. Or it becomes like a small stage in the hands of larger one. No matter how much it turns to hell, no matter how much the characters go after their petty, selfish appetites, there is something there, hovering over and with, something that is not hell, but is felt as an absence, waiting. One thing that helps this notion in the book is the fact that the sins that take place do not have any staggering, overpowering decadence to them. They have a pathetic, last-minute meanness and rotten pettiness to them.     This is not a nihilistic yarn. Neither is it merely obsessed with absurdity, though absurdity does abound. This is not Kafka.    This book, as a creation, has such a homespun feeling, but completely devoid of flippancy. It is so thoroughly a piece of genuine craftmanship that it makes Evelyn Waugh look a little pale. It's hard to describe. Almost as though it were too simple for our conditioning and our complexities. It is really a novel apart from other novels. Reading this book is sort of like watching a long train sliding across a horizon. You look at the cargo, and there are brief flashes between the cars. And then something occurs that is like an understatement, but bigger than what you expected. The last car, the caboose, goes across your vision, and it underlines the horizon you now see in the absence of the train. In a word, the book, at least I think in part is about HOPE. Not superfical hope that gaurantees something with a complete picture. That would not be hope. But RADICAL hope. The hope that St. Paul speaks of. But the way this book gets this across is not in any way pushy. There are not very many books that are as undeniable as this one, yet without any definite words to explain why it is undeniable. Wiseblood is a novel alive unlike any other.    
 Great horror flick, good acting, and story line.  Pop some popcorn and settle back for a top of the line scarey movie. It also has some great humo 
 The Abyss is a great soundtrack and fans of Silvestri will absolutely love. His trademark writing style is present throughout most of the score. The main reason to get this score is definitely for the last 3 tracks, especially "The Finale". In these 3 tracks, Silvestri unleashes awe and wonder and lets the orchestra and choir soar into the heavens for about 13 minutes. This material is some of the best music he has ever written and appears in compilation CDs everywhere. The "Main Title" hints at the material in the last 3 tracks and then bursts into a snare drum solo. The action music, which is also good, is trademark Silvestri with brass and percussion, present in "The Crane", "The Fight", and "Sub Battle". The real treat is the last 3 tracks, so if listening to the score from beginning to finish, be patient and wait for the last 13 minutes. It's well worth the wait 
 The reviewer who complained that this book is just academic twaddle seemingly couldn't possibly be a true Simpsons fan.  This book is an excellent entree into the culture theory of ideological poisoning that is at the heart of all media--conservative, right-wing media--in America today. (Not that there is any viable liberal left-wing media in America today, regardless of what the GOP would have you believe.) Every image you see coming at you from TV, movies, video games, etc. is designed to suck you into the consumerist ideological trap that the writers of the Simpsons are dedicated to making you question.  The Simpsons as a cartoon is show to be highly worthy of penetrating critique, something that most viewers aren't bothered with attempting.  The first two chapters of the book, both of which examine consumerism/capitalism's failings and how the Simpsons manage to exploit those failings, are the highlights of the book.  If you just want a listing of movie references, read the highly entertaining episode guides (I own all three to date), but you want to understand how the film references are used to provide further dissident and subversive layers to the show, buy this book.  The only quibble: It fails to entertain the question of how oppositional--to consumer culture--the Simpsons can be when it produces billions of dollars of revenue from merchandise 
 I like the pictorial instructions and detailing.  It was loaded with good instrutions and variety 
 This is one of the most popular book on introdutory set theory that has been around for decades. Famous book! I was surprised to come across a problem book that is to company this Naive guy which is by Sigler. Very good readind indeed! 
 Now that our democratic system has been eroded almost to the point of no repair, perhaps we should read books like this one to refresh our minds about what this country has always stood for. 
 This is an inspiring volume! Not quite a biography, but a personal history of 25 years of ministry at one of the world's best known churches, Westminster Chapel. Dr. Kendall's accounts of the changes that God brought to the Chapel during his ministry are sometimes nearly breathtaking. You feel his hurt, and you share his bliss as Dr. Kendall guides the tour of God's sovereign revelation of His glory during those turbulent, yet fulfilling years.  We are able to meet such notable personalities as Arthur Blessitt, Billy Graham, Paul Cain and Rodney Howard-Browne. Not to mention the heart-felt and loving description of Dr. Kendall's predecessor and mentor, the larger-than-life Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.  We also get a variety of eye-opening theological insights through examining some of the things which Dr. Kendall both taught and learned during those years. I appreciate the simplicity with which he explains what could be very complex theological ideas.  A fascinating read. Pastors, theologians and Christians of many backgrounds will come to love Dr. Kendall, even if they have not had the opportunity to read any of his other outstanding books, and even if they happen to disagree with some of his theological conclusions. He is without question a man of God, and a man used mightily of God 
 If your into knowing more about the big picture this is the book/dvd to do it. Very scientific in nature but interesting to average folk 
 Lucky for all of us, Steely Dan recordings are always cheap wherever you go. It is always a super bargain when you lay down $8 for this caliber of entertainment. The Royal Scam is a pretty good Dan album-a step down from the perfect "Katy Lied", a hard album for anyone to top. Everyone wants to get all hyper about the guitar on this album, and while the licks are certainly beautiful, I find the drumming on Royal Scam to be more pleasing. 
 I bought this book for a course I am taking in graduate school and I have sincerely enjoyed reading it.  The information is presented clearly and it reveals some truly interesting things about the brain and how it functions in learning.  I enthusiastically recommend it 
 A spunky young Parisian named Josette must find a way to help her best friend, a young mother whose husband has been murdered by the CGS, get out of France. She barters for their passage to England with some incriminating  letters that the CGS is desperate to get ahold of. But when the plan falls  apart and Josette herself is facing the guillotine, The Scarlet Pimpernel  must spirit her away from the jaws of death. This is a well-crafted tale of  intrigue, murder and romance. Percy is in top form battling Chauvelin and  his goons. Chauvelin is particularly bloodthirsty in this one 
 Dr. Levine once again shows us how no one wants to fail, but may fail in the face of overwheming obstacles. I just happen to be reading this book when I had a boy in class, Ruben, who failed to complete any class work. It was easy to recognize his lack of fine motor skills. Once the problem was diagnosed, we were able to use multiple strategies to overcome this block and help Ruben find his level of success.  As teachers, knowing how to diagnose a learing difficulty and being able to intervene with stratgies to help should be our goal. Dr. Levine, with his extraordinary insight and clinical experience takes the guess work out of this process for those of us in the field.  A must read for teachers who want to see all of their students succeed, not just the ones who do what we say when we say it. 
 "Different Seasons" is a remarkable story collection when one realizes that several of the stories within were later made into successful motion pictures. Indeed, there is some really great fiction here and not all of it has to do with the more traditional Kingesque stories of monsters and malevolent beings from another planet; King attacks the reader with a horror that is more psychological and personal than it is fantastical. For example, "Apt Pupil" is the tale of a young man whose own inner evil is awakened when he befriends an ex-Nazi who shares with him the atrocities he experienced during the holocaust. And "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption" capitalizes on anyone's worst nightmare: being incarcerated for a crime they didn't commit. The writing here is solid and, of course, King is an excellent, natural born storyteller. The only real criticism I have for this book is its lack of flowing, artistic prose. If you'd care to check out a story collection that is highly original, erotic, and brimming with horror, I'd recommend "Revenant" by Gaines Galloway, who is also a King fan, yet brings a certain level of dark, artistic prose to his work. Other than that, "Different Seasons" is another genius-level work from one of the uncontested masters of the horror-genre. Definitely worth reading and belongs in your personal library 
 In these last days we are witnessing incredible upheavels in this world. Like the recent Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast of America is just one example of many such extreme cyclonic disasters happening around the globe,and not to mention 'that Tsunami' that nearly crippled a number of countries.   Are these the Signs of the End of this Age? - Jesus said, "Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ, and will deceive many'. You will hear of wars and rumours of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth-pains.Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. At that time many will turn away from The (true) Faith and will betray and hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of many will grow cold, but he who stands firm to the end WILL BE SAVED. And 'THIS GOSPEL of the Kingdom' will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." (Matt: 24:4-14). We are seeing this prophesy happening as we speak.   These books is a MUST read for every Christian today,it will accurately point out and bear witness to all the biblical truths that awaits this world, as we the true children of God await the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. It will deliver you from deceitful and false doctrines about the end times, which is in fact leading those who adhere to these false doctrines, to destruction.   You will see for the first time the truth exposed in Revelations so that the end times may be known and the faith if all the true believers in this world, are not shaken or stolen.   Order your copy today!   Phil Grahn       
 I have read WoN in three different editions and undoubtedly the best was the definitive version in the Glasgow edition of his Collected Works. This is cheaply and conveniently reporinted in the Liberty Fund edition which I recommend to anyone who is actually *studying* the text. It notes variations between different editions and has extremely useful notes which are helpful in understanding Smith's relations to his predecessors.  It's an interesting book, over-quoted and under-read. Read it - all of it - and you will find a rather different argument and conclusions from that bestowed upon this classic by partisans of untrammeled free markets who trumpet some sound-bites from the book but reject Smith's underlying argument 
 Well Done! Even the layman can walk away with a grasp of this instrument. Anyone who researches the history of rock and roll needs to read this book, even if they don't play guitar. I can't wait for their next book.-JD 
 I hate the way the Dragen King wanted to burn all the books in China.  But I am glad that Jack and Annie saved one.  They escaped eveything 
 This product is amazing.  Not only did I get a very good tasting product, but I also got a hand written note AND a free sample of candy made fresh by Das Foods.  I also purchased the Lava Salt with the same reaction.  I would recomend this product to anyone who is looking for one of those different seasonings for their food 
 I took this book along when we went to Florida over Thanksgiving. While we did the usual Orlando stuff, we also visited several of the towns listed in the book. It was a great experience to see what is "off the beaten path". Small towns with everyday people going about their daily business, much like our own home town. It was nice to walk through shops and sit down at restaurants that didn't have a "theme". If you are going to Florida, I highly reccomend it as a travel guide 
 Hilarious from beginning to end!  Dr. Pearl er Eugene Levy, will you marry me????  
 Very good!  Thought provoking, much better than thought implantation the Noise Machine goes for 
 to a part of modern-day warfare that does not seem to get its proper consideration in light of the massive damage it can do, *Plague Wars* is a fine historical overview that does not get too bogged down in the textbook bio aspect of biological warfare, but rather concentrates on the more easily-appreciated facts of who (who has them, who is willing to use them) what (bio and chemical agents we're looking at), where (have they or could they be expected to be used) and how (what strategies, vectors, etc). I was impressed by the balanced tone of the book, which conveys the seriousness of the topic without tending toward sensationalis 
 This is in my top ten favorites to read and re-read. I was lucky to have actually find this book laying around, now I feel it has actually found me 
 My daughter is a HUGE Hello Kitty fan!!  She loves this book. It is very easy for her to read.  This is important because she is in the beginning stages of learning how to read.  This book ois a hit here in our home!!  Very cute book!! 
 I am so glad that this album is still available for the masses.    Released during the peak of Hip-Hop music, "Back to Wreck Shop" is definitely one of the best rap albums of all time - almost to the level of the Ultramagnetic MCs' "Critical Beatdown" (without a doubt THE best rap album).  Ice Dog, T.L., L.A. Kid, and even Monty G definitely display their lyrical skills and street toughness on this album.  And, DJ 2Tuff really shines throughout the entire LP (my favorite performance of his coming on the track "Come On & Go Off").  If you don't have this album then you need to immediately make it a part of your collection.  One of the classics! 
 This book is strongly Calvinistic.  I cannot confess to make too much of the same claim for myself.  However, having said this, the book represents a powerful portrayal of seventeen attributes of God.  Above all, it portrays God as a sovereign God, "above all praise", whose omniscience and omnipotence reach to the farthest imaginable recesses of this world.  Each section is well supported with appropriate Scriptures, some word studies, and fascinating observations.  This is not merely a systematic theology.    The usual questions of Calvinism arise of course.  I shall note just one overriding emphasis of the book.  Pink states:  "He [God] fixed all the circumstances in the lot of individuals, and all the particulars which comprise the history of the human race from its commencement to its close.  He did not merely decree that general laws should be established for the government of the world, but He settled the application of those laws to all particular cases . . . to the most insignificant creatures, and the most minute events."  On the positive side, Pink portrays a God who is alive and all-powerful.  On the other hand, there would seem no doubt that God, as He is portrayed in the Bible, has a dynamic, responsive, living relationship with His children.  One finds little if any room for such a view in the book.   I recently had an interesting discussion with a colleague, with whom I graduated at a Calvinist seminary.  As we remembered fellow graduates, he noted that a strength of Calvinists is that they tend to endure in ministry.  They are not wearied by petty opposition, or worried that things might run out of control.  However, another minister disagreed -- and she listed some examples.  Calvinists, she said, enter the ministry with a rigid set of beliefs -- yet there they come face to face with people of the real world.  That is where it all comes unstuck.   Pink himself has the following to offer, as he contemplates Christian ministry:  "How refreshing, then, how unspeakably blessed, to . . . behold the One who is faithful, faithful in all things, faithful at all times."  This, he says, serves to "much quieten the minds of God's people".  In the Foreword to the book, Pink notes that a true knowledge of God is foundational.  "An unknown God can neither be trusted, served, nor worshipped."  From this point of view, the book does much to fulfil its purpose.  Although it takes a strongly Calvinistic stance, it has stood the test of time, and deserves to have a broader appeal.  It deserves to be read for its strengths, even if one is unable to swallow it whole.  
 I loved this book just as well as the others, and the grimness just made it better.  It starts off with the death of a supporting character, and has the characters eking out an existence in a valley where they believe everyone is dead, leaving you hoping at the end that a glimmer of hope may appear.  However, it does have some sweet moments, like Fone and Smiley's little talk by the fireside and Phoney and Fone turning into Ishmael and Captain Ahab.  All in all, you'll love this and all the other BONE books, whether you love Mickey Mouse or The Lord of the Rings (BONE is quite Tolkienesque. 
 NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN was a long time in coming for Sean Connery's return. In 1983 when this film was released he went up against Roger Moore's 007 in OCTOPUSSY. I think Connery's film was much better. It was one of the best Bond films since ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. I like it when Bond films take advantage of European locations as this one did. This is one of the better bond films. The music was the only thing wrong with it. I did not hear the James Bond theme at all in this movie.  When are they going to release a 2 disc special edition DVD of NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN? There should be plenty of extras to go around on this large scale Bond film.  NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN has one of the best casts of actors of any James Bond film. Besides Sean Connery, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max von Sydow, Bernie Casey and Edward Fox are outstanding and very strong actors. Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera's over-the-top performance was a highlight. Even Rowan Atkinson was in there for good measure. Bond may have gotten wet in this one but his Martini certainly stayed dry!  
 For the fans of Warner Bros. animation,here is another great collection of the studio's Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies,presented in the films' original form. Not those mutilated Blue Ribbon re-issues that A.A.P.(Associated Artists Productions) further mutilated. A.A.P. carefully ruined many of the Paramount Popeye cartoons as well. Again,you'll see your favorite WB cartoon stars Bugs Bunny,Daffy Duck,Porky Pig,Elmer Fudd,Yosemite Sam,Sylvester,Tweety,Foghorn Leghorn,Pepe Le Pew,Speedy Gonzales,Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner tickling your funny bones with their zany madness. If not already,Turner Classic Movies should air these cartoons since Cartoon Network currently isn't. However,some cartoons will probably never appear on future sets since television mogul Ted Turner,owner of the Atlanta-based TCM,CN,TBS Superstation and Turner Network Television,continued the ban on certain shorts from television and video when he purchased the shorts from A.A.P.,a subsequent owner. Possibly,Turner will reconsider. These shorts contained situations found offensive by African-Americans and Orientals,respectively. However,to have such shorts in your personal collection is no big deal. I have a VHS tape with short subject cartoons that were either never aired on television or were before and later banned. Anyway,for all the WB cartoon conisseurs,enjoy this collection and anticipate the arrival of Volume 5 
 I bought Dandys Rule OK after I had owned ...The Dandy Warhols Come Down for about 5 months.  Although I could not get over how good Come Down was, Dandys Rule OK is even better.  Among all of the albums that I own, this is  one of my favorites.  Some of the best songs are "(Tony, This Song is  Called) Lou Weed", "Nothin' To Do", "Dick", and  the unbelievable epic "It's a Fast-Driving Rave-Up With the Dandy  Warhols Sixteen Minutes" 
 If you're a fan of the movie, "A Christmas Story," you'll enjoy this book. It was the basis for the popular film which is now a seasonal classic. I bought it as a gift for my son, and of course I had to read it myself first. If you cherish the memory of Ralphie's visit to Santa, his pink bunny outfit or the Bumpus hounds theft of the turkey, you'll probably love reading the source of all those moments. I highly recommend it and look forward to presenting it to my son on his birthday! 
 I found Irwin's Tips & Traps When Buying a Home useful when I bought my first house.  I expect this to be useful also 
 .....has always been of the finest quality; the shipping prompt, and nothing ever damaged or shop-worn.  I've ordered via the I-net for about 6 years, and Amazon is the only supplier I can rely on for not back-ordering or delaying my product.  Also, nothing is ever damaged; worn, or inferior in quality - something I can't say for the other retailers I've tried...often having to return the item, or even being improperly billed on my credit card.  I sure feel safe and secure with Amazon - just the best.  Diane Stirling 
 This book is a well-written, methodical approach to sea kayak navigation. Utilizing common-sense language, it gives the reader a fascinating overview of navigation basics up through more advanced topics. It gives extensive treatment to navigation fundamentals that prepare the reader for more complex tasks such as calculating ferry angles and lines of position, dead reckoning, and trip planning in high current and windy conditions. Photography and illustration is excellent, and Mr. Killen's writing style brings a humorous, relaxed approach to a subject that many avoid because of fear or intimidation. Killen's knowledge is comprehensive, and his ability to reduce complicated topics to easily digested parts, then place them back in relation to the whole is first rate. As a licensed sailboat captain, diving instructor, and certified kayak instructor I have used navigation skills often. However, until I read this book, I was navigating in a counter-intuitive, laboured process. I've found many time saving methods using information and skills demonstrated here, and my navigational accuracy has increased as well. A major bonus was the inclusion of an appendix by Timothy Williams, that gives World Wide Web addresses and links (with capsule reviews) for many interesting and time-saving sites dealing with navigation. All in all, the best, most complete instructional tome available for kayakers and small boat sailors.   
 Esse livro é fantástico para pessoas que estejam começando no After Effects. Tem uma base muito boa, e juntando com o volume 2, aí sim, fica completo o aprendizagem. Indico esse livro atodos que estejam começando, e aqueles que já dominam a técnica, é um livro bom para consulta

While many authors today are selling supplements that do not  live up to their promises, Dr. Weil gives common sense advise on what to  spend your money on that actually will make a difference in your life, and  health.  This is a pocket book that your will use over and over.  Buy it  and use it with all of Dr. Weils' books to heal your life 
 If you would like to read a simpler, more user-friendly presentation of Calvinism, I would recommend THE CALVINISM-ARMINIANISM DEBATE, featuring White and Dave Hunt. Dave Hunt's material in that book is pretty much worthless, and Hunt is incompetent when it comes to interpreting Scripture. But White's chapters are clear and simple.  This book, on the other hand, is not simple. White delves into a great deal of grammar, which most grammatically-illiterate Americans don't understand or remember, but which becomes very important in making sense out of the New Testament. The material is densely packed with systematic theology and technical terms.  My opinion of Norman Geisler (of whom this book is a refutation) is that he is very knowledgeable in philosophy, and glib in his use of language, but he doesn't know how to exegete Scripture. One impression you will come away with is that, even if you don't accept Calvinism, White has a more-than-competent knowledge of how to do N.T. interpretation, whereas Geisler shows none.   Geisler can make clever distinctions (hard determinism which he rejects, versus self-determinism which he advocates), but shows no ability to refute criticisms. Calvinists also teach that human beings make choices spontaneously, as opposed to being like animals or machines; the issue has to do with the effects of Adam's sin. Did man's fall into sin so "poison the well" of the heart that the desires that drive choice became evil and the mind that evaluates choice become clouded and self-serving?   Geilser says that the human heart is not dead, and that it is not in bondage to sin or Satan. He does not accept what the Bible teaches about the depth, intensity, and intractibility of sin's effect on the mind. As a consequence, he is unable to respond pursuasively to White's exegesis, and this renders his Arminian theology book very vulnerable to criticism 
 Paris Armstrong's husband of 24 yrs decided one day that he had enough of the marriage and wanted a divorce. Paris was devastated. She did not see it coming. After struggling over the loss, she decided to move to San Francisco to be near her children. After she settled into her new life, she started dating. She ended up going out with a string of losers one right after the other. Eventually she stopped looking and by coincidence she ran into someone who was suitable. A happy and romantic ending 
 I've been interested in Sam Shepard for quite some time now and this book was a great addition to my personal library.  I suggest it to anyone with an interest in the dramatist.  Well worth the money 
 Inspiring book that denounces the dutiful life and teaches you to live with purpose and passion for Christ 
 Why all the complaints? Pardon the cliche, but with his unique sound, if he sang the phone book it would be enjoyable. Sure, he doesn't stray far from the original artist's style, but that is what makes this fun to listen to, we know these songs by heart. 
 Fast pacing and fine acting make this low budget version of the classic campfire tale of "the Hook" really worth a look.  What appears to be a straight forward story of hormonally charged teenagers attacked by a maniac at their make out spot is actually a richly textured morality tale riddled with undertones of incest, betrayal and infidelity. The subtle allusions to TV and movie classics of the past are fun to look for and hard to spot. Like a lot of films in this genre, half the fun is guessing who the killer is and this film really throws in several great twists. Lovers Lane was also instrumental in making the careers of several of the actors involved, like Anna Faris who went on to star in "Scary Movie I & II", as well as Billy O'Sullivan who was then cast in "Wakin Up In Reno" with Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron. There's also some great music including a track by rising R&B singer Colin Peacock.  So what if it doesn't have some of the glossy effects of Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer - this movie makes up for it on guts and raw energy.  Definitely something that should be on a collectors shelves if for no other reason that to see the "first" movie of some future stars 
 The canonical reference in this field is the venerable Brealey Myers book, which is often considered a bit too deep as an introductory finance text. The Brigham Ehrhardt book, however, is much more approachable. The layout of the chapters is much better than Brealey Myers', and mathematical concepts like beta are explained in a user-friendly manner 
 Please do not let this be your first Read of the Enders series books! This is like the 6th(?) book in the series and has the feel of being a bit tired. A person will get frustrated with the charicter development in this book if they haven't read Enders Game and the other books in the series. Without that background the reader may think some of the charicters a bit empty and grow inpatient with the pace of the story. If you do not have the history of the previous books you may tire while waitng to find out what happens to them. Card is a great author and is still able to squeeze out clever twists in the story that seems to have gone on for lifetimes. And, Enders Game with it's fantastic ending will be a masterpiece that all his work will be compared to for lifetimes. I don't know of any author who wrote a masterpiece every time and it would be unfair to the author to his work be evaluated by this one novel. You will be unfair to yourself if you read this book before reading the others in the series 
 This final novel in Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy of the southwest brings together the themes McCarthy has developed throughout the trilogy.  In the first novel, All the Pretty Horses, McCarthy stresses the romanticism of John Grady Cole, who runs away to become a cowboy, suffers a heart-breaking loss at love, and returns, sadder and perhaps wiser, to find solace in the solitude of his work on the plains.     Times are changing as the 20th century progresses, however, and the independent life of ranchers is threatened.  In The Crossing, a far darker novel which takes place a few years later, Billy Parham, another young man, takes off with his brother, crossing the border into Mexico, to explore its older traditions and ways of life.  Cities of the Plain, with Biblical suggestions in the title, brings young John Grady Cole and the older Billy Parham together, as they work on the McGovern ranch in Texas in the 1950s.  The wilderness is disappearing, cities are encroaching, and an army base may take their land.  Focusing less on the harshness of ranch life than in past novels, McCarthy here concentrates more on character, in this case, that of John Grady Cole, who falls in love with a prostitute from Juarez and wants to bring her across the border to his way of life.  Billy Parham counsels him against marrying her, but John Grady is determined to wrest her away from Eduardo, her manager, and give her the peace that she has never known.  Life is harsh, however, and outcomes are bleak for dreamers and altruists.  John Grady soon finds himself engaged in a struggle with Eduardo which is vicious and unrelenting, a metaphorical struggle between honor and evil, and between civilized values and the "justice" of tooth and claw, hope and desperation, and acceptance of change and adherence to the past.  McCarthy's gorgeous descriptions of this vanishing way of life on the ranch are as effective here as they are in the other novels in the trilogy, though they seem to be presented nostalgically.  Times are changing, and the "old man," the ranch owner, is now becoming senile.  Civilization is drawing closer, and John Grady, the cowboy, uses taxis instead of horses when he is in a hurry to travel.  As McCarthy draws the reader into John Grady's story, the reader knows that the struggle between him and Eduardo is a mythic struggle, and s/he also knows what the likely outcome will be.  The elegance with which the ending is drawn, however, gives both potency and poignancy to McCarthy's message.  Mary Whipple 
 Yeah I just gotta agree with the other guys. This album is simply too dope. Kam is far from your "show-off/blingbling" type rapper. With down to earth real situations displayed over Battlecat, Warren G and Big Hutch (from Above The Law) beats this album is just overly enjoyable and just a really good experience 
 A controversial period in Roman Catholicism, this relfects sources from the time on life in a turmoil when even the church itself transited in ideology. Innocents were executed ... and the intentions vary. The only thing I will say is that the Church believed it was engaging in a form of purification but it was probably unChristian in its implementation. Christ converted followers through love while this time in history was the Christian version of the jealous Pharisees. The late Pope John Paul 2 worked on interfaith dialogue .... which was a healing intention given this 200 years plus time of fear and fire and brimstone.  I will say this .... some of the "witches" were innocent healers ... but others were engaged in sorcery and mischief which were endangering people. This distinction should have been clearer with the church 
 I found part four "Moving from one system to many" quite useful and relevant in today's loosely-coupled distributed enterprise applications scenario. This book is a good read for those architects who are into product development. 
 In "Slow Way Home", Michael Morris gives a gripping tale of raw Southern life.  It's ugly, it's dramatic--it's as real as it can get.  Brandon Willard was born to a single mother who bounced from relationship to relationship, most of which inflicted constant abuse on both her and her son.  Finally, after another man comes along with a grand dream, Sophie ships Brandon off to live with his God-fearing grandparents.  Nana and Poppy give the boy stability and love, but they soon learn that the law favors the mother--no matter her history and her condition.  They are forced to flee with the boy and start a new life in Florida.  The tale is gripping with such staples of Southern life as fishing, farming, and the KKK.  It's a heartwarming tale of how good (eventually) triumphs 
 Excellent flick, one of Sean Penn's best movies, definatly tops Fast Times At Ridgemont Hig 
 I love to backpack in the Sierras and Trinity Alps and am happy to say this guide is most helpful. It is full of organized details and helpful information for the serious backpacker. The color photos are a plus. I have been to many of these places as part of shorter trips as well, and they are as gorgeous as the book describes 
 Evita is the best contemporary historical musical out there. Madonna shines in this film, as does Antonio Bandaraz. Anyone who doesn't appreciate Evita, obviously doesn't know their history.  My one complaint is that the DVD has NO extra features! There really is no point in purchasing the DVD over the VHS unless you want to be able to flip through the chapters or care about wide screen. I would have liked to see some director's commentary as well as an interview with Madonna. Some historical notes would have been nice too 
 I've loved Joss Stone's gritty voice ever since I first heard it on the 2005 Grammy Award show.  I rushed out to get Soul Sessions and thought it was wonderful, despite her feelings about it now.  However, Introducing Joss Stone is a powerful representation of what Joss can do and it is clear that she feels every lyric, every melody of this album.  The music is classic funk and R&B with a hip contemporary vibe.  Definitely my new favorite.  The fusion of talent, inspiration and pure joy certainly always makes for a better product and gives the listener that same euphoric vibe, even on a song about heartbreak.  Run, don't walk, to get this one 
 I thought I knew a lot about baby's developement after child care education and years of being around friends' babies, but when I had my own 5 weeks ago, I was caught a little off guard when I realized my lack of understanding about what the newborn is going through and how to deal with it.    I bought this book for my sister two years ago and decided I'd give it a read... it explains simply the developemental stages the infant goes through, includes other parent's experiences, sections on what you as a parent may be feeling, and the best parts are the checklists which tells you the signs of how your baby is changing... All add up to a greater understanding and me being a better "baby parent".  Pick this one up for all new parents 
 This is a tribute to Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler, all rolled into one neat murder mystery. Bernie and Carolyn spend the weekend in a New England guesthouse, which attempts to replicate an authentic old English manor. When guests begin showing up murdered, it's Bernie who plays the part of Hercule Poirot or, if you like, Philip Marlowe, as he gathers the clues, which will hopefully lead him to the murderer before too many more guests are knocked off. Being a guesthouse, there are suspects aplenty delivering us ample opportunity to figure out the mystery ourselves. If mystery fans will be delighted by this book, then fans of the British crime story will be even more so. Combining the wit and humour of Lawrence Block with the traditional murder mystery creates a deadly weekend, though presented in a light and breezy manner 
 Too often, parents expect common sense and justice to prevail in a family law courtroom.  By the time they learn their lesson, it's too late, and there's no "do over".  This book does an excellent job outlining a few critical areas for parents facing child custody litigation:  1.  Not all evidence is relevant or important.  It's important to learn what matters.  2.  Attorneys are frequently overburdened and won't build your case for you, unless you have a ton of money.  It's important for you to lead the process on building your case, with the assistance of your attorney (not the other way around).  Then, the attorney can effectively argue your case in court.  3.  Judges don't make decisions based upon kharma, common sense conclusions, or on a parent's assurance that she/he is better.  Judges make decisions on evidence-based arguments.  If you don't master those three areas, your chances of prevailing are drastically reduced.  For the area of child custody conflict that deals with building your case-- this book does an excellent job.  It's not the "be all, end all" guide for child custody, but it serves a critical area; just as its title implies. 
 Dan The Automator demands space on you iPOD. Here Dan escapes from producing his classic blues variety of hip-hop to produce a sort of darker 'Deltron 3030' with the same futuristic feel. Although this album is nearly 10 years old this is where where hip-hop is moving at the moment! It is also (like all of Dan's other works) eons more musically ahead of the game where ganga' hip-hop is kinda stuck coming up the next harder than thou rapper  who can impress eight year olds too. Although Dr. Octagonecologyst is not as fast as modern raps it is just as complex with great artists like MF Doom probably nodding at this album which obviously has majorly influenced them. Like I have said before, once you have finally gone through the mainstream stuff you will probably venture down the avenues of MF Doom, Aesop Rock, Mr. Lif and most certainly you will want to start a Dan the Authomator collection. And again, with a COVER like THAT how can you refuse 
 I had almost forgotten what my language could do - there are exquisite English words on each and every page (sometimes 2 or 3 on the same page!).  Of course, it's that kind of romantic Sherlock Holmes kind of novel that modern people don't like to read, because they've forgotten the French Revolution; but, if you're not too proud to read Daphne DuMaurier, jump into this one.  I must also add that I like the Microsoft reader - really has a rich, book-reminiscient look-and-feel 
 Well it is here!  After worldwide popular demand---it is finally here-Bob Marley & I-Three & The Wailers---LIVE at the Rainbow Theatre-1977 on DVD (I wrote five letters to Tuff Gong Studios requesting to re-issue it from VHS to DVD).  It arrived just in time to continue in our celebration for Brother Bob's 60th Birthday Celebration.  In addition, it arrived just in time to be given as gifts during the Christmas and Kwanzaa holiday season.  When the DVD arrived in my mailbox a few days ago, I want to check it out immediately (saw it many times on VHS, but DVDs are generally better in picture and sound quality) but I drew my brakes and waited for the weekend when I could allot a few hours of quality time to view it.  I took off my shoes, sat in my favorite chair, lit up my peace pipe, poured a glass of my Ginseng & Herbal Root Elixir and popped in the concert DVD.  Five minutes into the concert, I was taken back to the moments when I saw Bob Marley live in Philadelphia, PA--1978 the first time (I was blessed to witness Brother Bob in three concerts and visited his grave site-Nine Mile Road---in Rainbow Country--Jamaica). It was one the most awesome, uplifting and phenomenal musical experience in my life to date.   The audience stood up the entire show---singing, chanting and dancing with the captivating 2/4-offbeat reggae rhythms as their political and spiritual consciousness was enhanced by Bob Marley's gusty and social conscious lyrics.  (The building lights were turned on to stop the show because he was jammin so long and tuff.)  His reggae lyrics are of sweet songs of Black Love; protest songs of Black Rebellion; powerful songs of Black Liberation and sorrow songs of Black Redemption utilizing African-Jamaican double-entendre, metaphors, proverbs, parables, utterances, call and response, and Biblical references as its method to touch the spiritual and cultural ethos of people of African descent, and others who can feel it.   Bob Marley's offering to the unique genres of reggae music is an outstanding human testament to his survival ingeniousness and the will to achieve---to bare the worst and make something good out of it for all humanity to benefit. It has been said that some of the best of human musical artistic expressions can come out of the worst of human suffering and from the warm water deep in the well of human spirituality.  Such was the circumstances of Bob Marley and so many other African-Jamaican musical artists who suffered and paid their dues to become impressive international reggae musicians that are driven by their raw talent, rebel politics and Rastafarian spiritual convictions. The concert at the Rainbow Theater shows Bob Marley when he was at his apex on the world music stage singing some of his most cherished and classical tunes.  His passionate artistic musical delivery, energy, style, timing and lyrics have carved a permanent place in millions of minds, hearts and souls worldwide.  Purchase this DVD today and place it among your most special, loved and sacred music.  Also, buy it and pass it on as a unique gift.  Bob Marley & I-Three & The Wailers---LIVE at the Rainbow Theatre-1977 on DVD was my 53rd Birthday present to I & I (to me & from me).     One Love-Forward & Upward,  Brother Ras Mojo Ibo Changa  
 As soon as my son is old enough to read and understand this novel, I am going to challenge him to read it one summer. I feel that every young person, especially young black males should read this novel. It accurately reflects how we are all products of our environment, and even sometimes caught up in situations beyond our control, but it is our response to these circumstances that is key. But the largest lesson to be learned and to understand is that there are always consequences to our actions, whether our actions are intentional or not.   The novel brings up the interesting dichotomy that exists between nature and nurture. I eventually came to the conclusion that faced with some of the same challenges that Bigger Thomas had to deal with (racism, stereotypes, and himself...perhaps his own worse enemy), I could have made some of the same decisions. Even more troubling at the end of the novel is my conclusion that any of us could have been 'Bigger' because at the end of the novel, Bigger wasn't even the issue, it was Society and their response to Bigger. 
 This book was one of my best loved Shakespeare's plays. It really gave me comfort and laugh whenever I read it. I hope in real lifre I can find a forest like the one in the play so I can hide my self there and live "as I like it". Rosaind is the best female character in the literature for her sense of humour and intelligence, and passion. Orlando reminds all those who ever loved of their first love, the bittersweet and compelling passion that one is not capable of getting rid of. If you had spare time, you really should read this play, I guarantee the language in this play is not that hard and you will find yourself so into this fantastic tale once you started reading it 
 Nathanael Greene was one of George Washington's most trusted subordinates.  This book does a signal job in describing why this was the case and why Greene deserved this trust.  Greene was a most unlikely military leader.  He was a complete amateur, coming into the military with very little martial background.  He had a physical disability.    Early on, he made a major error in the New York campaign, leading to the loss of troops who could not be spared, when the fort that he had urged be defended fell--with no strategic gain in the process.  Another leader might have cashiered Greene, but Washington maintained his faith in the junior officer.  Greene played an important role in the desperate attack on Trenton.  When General Gates suffered a disastrous defeat in the south, Greene was dispatched to somehow try to retrieve the situation.  Greene did well.  The irony of his life is that--after having provided yeoman service to the new republic--he did not long survive the victory to enjoy the fruits of success.  This is a solid biography of an underappreciated Revolutionary War leader; it is well worth reading 
 A Brief History of Time has had a tremendous impact on scientific thought since its initial publication in 1988.  The Big Bang and Black Holes have become parts of our common vocabulary.  Why review this book now?  Perhaps some readers are not aware of a special Commemorative Edition of this book that was issued as an "Updated Edition" on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of its initial publication.  In the "Acknowledgements" at the beginning of the book, Hawking gives great credit to his editors and friends who have helped him improve the book "considerably" in revising the text.  In this Edition, Hawking states "I have taken the opportunity to update the book and include new theoretical and observational results obtained since the book was first published. I have included a new chapter on wormholes and time travel.  I also describe the progress that has been made recently in finding dualities or correspondences between apparently different theories of physics." A discussion of the significance of cosmic microwave background and its fluctuations is included.  These are great reasons to reread this classic work, which has to be one of the finest in the history of science 
 I found this book on a supermarket book rack, read it and loved it.  It was the first J.P. Beaumont book I'd read, and as a result I'm now devouring the others, beginning with 'Until Proven Guilty'.  I'm now getting all of the background on Beau and Ron Peters and other characters.  When I've read them all, I'll reread 'Long Time Gone'. This is a great series of stories and I look forward to more J.P. Beaumont.  Jance's style is fast paced and easy to read; I have no problem keeping the details straight.  
 This is an excellent book that covers all the basics of getting started in real estate. It goes into the systems you need to be successful, such as developing your listing presentation, servicing your listings, and advertising. Everything is here. I recommend this book highly!! (It also helped me pass the CA broker exam. 
 This episode of Star Trek, "The Man Trap" is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise. Truthfully, "The Man Trap" terrified me (I was maybe two, or three, although I am sure by that time the series was limping along in it's third season and I was seeing a repeat for the first time); Star Trek was considered "adult programming", and as such I was not allowed to watch it - I used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights I stayed at their house, then would lay awake in my bed scared by what I'd seen, but excited just the same. Like another space show I enjoyed and was terrified by (Lost in Space), I didn't recognize Star Trek as anything but a world I wanted very much to be in, but remained frightened of anyhow (I was, as I said, very young).  
      I think the book Double Play At Short was a very good book. Matt Christopher is the author of this book, he writes many sports books. This was a book I couldn't put down because I was curious of what was going  to happen next.The characters were just like people I know. They acted the same way and had the same hobbies. This book is about a kid named Danny. He makes it to the championship series of his baseball league when he gets very mysterious of someone on the other team. He takes pictures of her and does a lot more to figure out who she is. If you read this book, you will find out what happens next. I think this book would be a very good book for any ages to read, whether it's an adult or kid. That's how much I think other people would enjoy this boook as much as I did 
 This book is an intellectually deeper, yet a more brief version of another very good review of philosophy book, Sophie's World. Comments by the authors are to the point and insightful. Loved it 
 The Euro Cuisine Yogurt Maker is SO FABULOUS you will want the extra jars. So will your family. When you're running low on yogurt, you can make another batch without "waiting" for all the jars in use to be emptied and washed.  Dishwasher safe means much to my family. Love it 
 You don't want to use up all your battery power transferring images to your PC, so this accessory is fantastic. It works for five different Nikon cameras and will save you a fortune in batteries and a lot of time waiting for batteries to recharge.  For the price, it's a bargain 
 Pam Johnson, self-taught cat psychologist, relates 13 true cases she has had to deal with oddly behaving cats (or their odd owners).  She writes that it's usual for her to be entering the owner's window now rather than going through the front door.  After you read through the cases, you'll understand why.  A gentle giant cat usually extroverted happy cat suddenly hiding in corners, a cat that shreds printing paper, a cat that runs itself into the wall, the cat who gets violent on Sundays, a cat that overgrooms itself so much that it gets bald, a cat that hates one of its owners when she comes home after work, 3 heartwarming stories involving owners with their cats, etc.  They're so funny, so entertaining, and makes you understand that we as humans are so ignorant as what it's like to be a cat and live in a cat's world.  It would DEFINITELY be great as gifts to other cat loving friends even if you buy them used/out of print.  I'll definitely be keeping it on my bookshelf with my other cat books 
 This Dover Thrift edition (1995) of "Journey to the Centre of the Earth" published by Routledge in 1876 is one of the three translations which are faithful to the Verne original. The usual translation refers to "Prof. von Hardwigg" and adds and changes much material. This translation refers to "Prof. Lidenbrodk", thus retaining Verne's original nomenclature. Although an anonymous translation, it may have been made by Henry Frith who translated other Verne books for Routledge. A note of caution: Amazon lumps all versions of this title together in reviews, so be aware that this review applies only to the Dover Thrift Edition, ISBN:-0-486-44088-5, 1995. 
 	Five Points was the name given to the neighborhood that sprang up in New York on top of the Collect lake after it was drained and covered over in 1813.  This neighborhood, having formed on the swampy land that was once home to only the worst of nuisance industries, became known throughout the nineteenth century for housing the dregs of humanity.  As Anbinder states in his title, it truly was the "World's Most Notorious Slum."  In fact, Five Points became an international tourist stop, attracting Charles Dickens, Abraham Lincoln, Davy Crockett, and many more to peer into the homes of the people who lived within.       Yes, Anbinder is an amazing historian.  Yes, this book accomplishes many lofty goals.  Anbinder introduces us to a colorful cast of characters, spotlighting the individuals, always, that make up the Five Points.   In addition to newspapers and accounts from the time, which were often augmented by the prejudices of the writers, Anbinder also makes excellent use of a variety of other records, such as bank ledgers, property records, censuses, as well as a host of other valuable sources that give the reader a brief glimpse into the lives of the Five Points denizens.  Anbinder's book also illustrates that the more the way Americans view poverty has changed, the more it has stayed the same.  Indeed, Anbinder's history of Five Points is so exhaustive and meticulously researched, that the reader can come away with so much more than one idea about poverty, or another theory of immigrant life.  But, even more than the above, this book is exciting.  It will draw you in and make you feel the humanity of all the different folks you meet.  This is a history book that reads much like a novel, in the vein of "The Children's Blizzard," or "The Great Influenza."  This DOES NOT read like a textbook.  I can't recommend it enough. 
 I really enjoyed this book. It tells about Arvigo's true life experiences with a healer. She shows us that it is up to all of us to save our planet. It is also true that we don't have to reinvent the wheel. She was able to get help from the New York Botanical Garden. Arvigo is really a brave woman 
 The book was very useful for sharing with the hurricane refugees staying in my home 
 I love Jane Eyre for so many reasons. The character of Jane is so amazing: so quiet and humble and patient, yet at heart so passionate and full of longing! She is small and plain, but has more determination than any other character we meet. She has a pure, beautiful heart and a passionate, tender soul. She is the most amazing character I have ever enountered in all of literature!  The book follows Jane Eyre who, despite the stability of her quiet, peaceful life as a governess, is ultimately lonely and longs to experience more of the world. Mr. Rochester is a cynical, haunted man, living a life of sin and debauchery, but whose pure heart yearns for a clean conscience and a chance at happiness. Their love is deep and tender, filling up Jane's lonely life and rejuvenating Mr. Rochester--but true love can never be built on lies. When Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's awful secret, she cannot stay with him. He has lied to her the entire time, loving her completely but selfishly, using her for his own purposes. His feelings are true, but he has to pay for his sins and become upright before God--only then can they be together. Mr Rochester hoped to find redemption in Jane, but true redemption can only come from God. 
 I read this book 2 years ago, and still consider it one of the most compelling and important books I have ever read. Besides being completely absorbed by this man's life and experiences, I learned so much valuable information about Cambodia from it that I wish it was required reading for anyone traveling there.   Blended seamlessly with the narrative you will learn of the history and culture of the Cambodians, the groundwork for the rise of the Khmer Rouge, the horrors and fallacies of life under a Communist regime, and the story of Pol Pot. I also gained an insight into Buddhist thought and daily life in Cambodia, all of which prepared me well for my trip there.  Haing Ngor's life story also helped me understand the damaging psychological consequences endured by the victims of this Holocaust, and of the difficulties Cambodians have had in trying to adjust to life in America. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from this book, and many which can give us a better ability to analyze current international events. If you read no other book about Cambodia, read this one 
 Zwillinger is an incomparable genius at organizing data, information, theory.  See my review of his Handbook of Differential Equations, which is the best thing in its field and which the reader should also purchase  regardless of whether currently into differential equations.  The other  reviewers have done a gone job noting details of this book.  Here I would  like to answer why tables and formulas are needed in a day when hand  computers are everywhere.  The answer is that we have to learn to think in  terms of tables and formulas to keep at the top of our fields (for example,  how many of you know that general relativity is based on sets of tables  called tensors?).  Computers today are stil mostly not for thinking but for  doing long calculations which involve repetition rather than innovative  thinking.  Make your hobby tables, formulas, equations, inequalities, and  you might pass Life 101 
 Funny cool piece to have if you are a Simpsons fan. 
 This CD has become a family favorite. Rosemary's voice never sounded better. Brings back many fond memories of cherished family gatherings. A must have for any holiday collection. Rosemary lives on 
 Okay if you don't all ready have both movies this isn't a bad deal. But if you can wait a little while I would bet this set will drop to twenty dollars. Either way, fans of Jack Black will love them both, he after all is 90 percent of the comedy in each one. School of Rock is great. When Jack pretends to be a substitute teacher at a private school he teaches a lesson about music those students will never forget. Orange County may not be as good but it still fairly funny thanks to Jack Black and some cameos by some other comedians. Get them 
 This is a good introduction for newer fans who might find it difficult at first getting used to their more "spaced out" cds. All the songs are warm and easily accessible. This and Workingman's Dead also seem to appeal to non-Dead Head types. What a collection of songs - Box Of Rain, Truckin', Ripple, ect. A very warm disc all the way around 
 I like this album solid beats all the way through good lyrics I just wish they hadn't fallen like they did but everybody thats been on top 4 a long time will fall no diss because the Wu held it down from 93 to seem like about 99 they are one of my favorite cliques....anyway add this to your Get lis 
 Oh my goodness, what a hoot. With the physical comedy of the Three Stooges, and sight gags from any Airplane! or Naked Gun movie, Kung Phooey is an independent triumph. It's all here folks, sure it's not as good as Kung Pow, but I don't think it has to be. This movie didn't have the budget or wizardry.  Art Chu (Bless you!!) is on a quest to San Fransisco to find the stolen 'Ancient Peach', the real Fountain of Youth. He is a Ninja Priest from the Shir-Le Temple. With the help of his cousin, LeRoy (dat's Roy Lee sucka!), Sue Shi, and the Stereotype Chinaman, our hero fights the evil doers who wish to keep the peach for themselves.  The brilliance of this film is the imagination. Independent films must rely on superb writing, acting, and wit to succeed when money is an object. Kunp Phooey succeeds on all levels. It has great gags, a decent story, and is well directed. You'll have chuckles here and there with straight up 'laugh out louds' mixed in for good measure. If you are weary of all the homemade indie films that are flooding the DVD market, fear not. This was not shot with a camcorder. 
 Your book has helped solve the ongoing health problems I have suffered for years.  I read the book and identified my nature, followed the recommendations and my illness has improved tremendously.  I am now able to enjoy my life without the nagging pains I used to have.  It is truly amazing all the other doctors I have been to over the years haven't caught on--The Brain does control the Body's Health. I am on my way to good health.  Great Book. 
 I bought the 2605dn because it is the first networked duplex color laser (to my knowledge) that isn't ridiculously expensive.  Everything is stable and robust; no problems running off USB or ethernet. No misfeeds, color and text both look nice. I mainly print documents with color figures/charts, so I can't speak to printing pictures.  Not blazingly fast (~10ppm) and the printer pauses to calibrate itself once in a while, but it's a great deal overall.  Printed 3903 color pages with the original cartridges ($0.08-0.09 per page) 
 I have read all 5 of the Womens's Murder Club series and look forward to another.  If you like to read about successful women, this series is for you.  They are fun to read and very exciting.  Happy reading.  
 Please read the review I just sent for the Turquoise set.  I am thrilled about the packaging and so happy that you didn't use styrofoam.  If it was sent by the vendor, please contact them and give them an "atta boy".  I'm happy about everything I recieved.  Fiesta ware is wonderful, I wish I'd ordered cobalt or purple.  Oh well, my problem,not yours....Please spread the word out to your vendors that eco-packaging is cheaper and uses less oil...Thank you, Daryl Bergman (and Mother Earth)...dary 
 This absorbing work exposes an immense gap in the literature about and our understanding of the past, and offers a huge canvas for further speculation. Highly recommended 
 Sizzla's voice is out of the box of conventional reggae vocals.  He has the most unique, unconventional, free flowing soulful reggae vocals in the industry. The band backs him up with some classic roots, bass heavy melodies and his backup singers add an essential ingredient to the chorus of most songs.      
 Rarely does a book do such a good job informing the reader in a way that can change lives. John Gray helps the reader understand there are inevitable differences between men and women and the key to success in relationships is to understand and navigate those differences rather than to try and change or ignore them. I also highly recommend Men in Marriage: Straight Talk For Men About Marriage: What Men Need to Know About Marriage (And What Women Need to Know About Men)by Marty Friedman.   
 This is a great book with all the nuances included to get a good start on eBay. Ginsberg leaves no stone unturned. But suppose you have an idea for a business on the Internet that is not about selling goods? Maybe you want a store with your name on it, or you have an idea for an information based business. Then I recommend "Internet Riches" by Scott Fox as a solid blueprint for developing your ideas and turning them into a lucrative Internet homebased business. What I liked best was the action plans for brainstorming these ideas and then the guidelines for implementing them. Very pragmatic 
 Great, Great, Great!!!  What more can I say, it's Bruce Campbell, 'nuff said.. 
 I have quoted and underlined and re-read this book so many times that it is falling apart.  If you can overcome the politically incorrect masculine form of writing, the material is as true to today as it was when it was written.  James Allen was truely an enlightened soul.  His writing is so packed with spiritual truths that the reader will want to read the text slowly and repeatedly to allow it to linger in the mind.  This is my favorite book of all time 
 This book is full of ideas for teachers and reading specialists looking for ways to help teach literacy.  Even if you work with struggling readers everyday, it's nice to pick up this book, find the section describing the difficulties a particular student has, and get quick, helpful ideas.  I used this text as a graduate student studying to become a reading specialist.  
 I was very disappointed when I got my book and on the cover wasn't the 1937 Harley as it showed when I ordered it, but an Indian. What's with that 
 Arnie's book is well-written, entertaining, and great reading.  It unveils the nuances that enabled Arnie to be the man who hoisted TV golf on his shoulders and elevated the game to the status it enjoys today. The book is  well-balanced in that it reveals Arnie's roots, both golf-wise and  developmental, growing-up in Latrobe PA and his conflicted relationship  w/his father, Deacon Palmer. Arnold's love of life, fierce  competitiveness,and his charsimatic personality are all thoroughly revealed  in this terrific book 
 keep 'em coming cause this is one the best anime series ever.  Shinichiro Watanabe rules 
 -Just a note: Get the newer eight dollar version!- After reading several of the reviews it became apparent that I should write one. There are flaws I see with some of the reviews written, I will address them after a quick summary, and cost/benefit analysis.   If you haven't heard of Chomsky, read any of his books or seen/heard any of his appearances, this probably isn't for you. I point you to Manufacturing Consent (the quintessential Chomsky DVD about American Culture, media, indoctrination, etc).   Whether or not you like Chomsky, this is a good DVD. I'm not going to summarize, (it's already been done), but for the price, this is a good deal. Whether you plan to write a paper on or just want to hear about the state sponsored international terror, hypocrisy, and moral issues in America's past and present; and the future implications of them. For eight dollars this is a great buy.   The Q&A portion of the extras, with fifteen questions, is alone worth the cost. The Q&A is an hour, with questions from both, people attending at Kennedy School of Govt. (Harvard), and people at MIT. They ask poignant questions with inspired responses from Noam.   Now to address comments by reviewers:  If you can't handle watching something without constant cuts, mind numbing music and lots of Hollywood glitz: this isn't for you. If you can't handle C-SPAN or a college lecture, this isn't for you. If you like Chomsky, and are willing to watch something that isn't the slightest bit reminiscent of the MTV beach house(like ... uh... what's it called? a documentary!) then check this out.   Most people outside of college and the scholarly community are unaware of, or don't think about many of the points Chomsky argues in his books, lectures and public appearances.  For that reason many people will dismiss what Prof. Chomsky says outright; however, if you are open to things that go against the "general American consensus": then take a look at this. This DVD looks at some of America's past and present forays in international terrorism. Chomsky presents many well documented facts, he demonstrates his sources, and makes a statement similar to, "check it out and make up your own mind."  That's exactly what I suggest you do.  I suggest you weigh the pros/cons and see if you think this is worth it. In my opinion, for this amount, this can be a great addition to anyone's collection of doc's. -Just a note: Get the newer eight dollar version! 
 This is a wonderful and EASY way to spice things up with your special someone.  The recipes are easy and fun to make.  Couldn't say for sure they work as well as claimed, but it's sure fun trying 
 I'm sure this will not help that much cuz I have not seen the moive but I've seen part of it on T.V.  Adults do not understand the back round of the show so it seems random. the magic items have power not made clear unless you watch the entire seires. a shadow world and fiend type monsters with dark powers comes on a little strong at first to many adults and me when I first saw it. then again watch Tea duel with cards like shining freindship and happy lover you'd never know that there were such things as zomibe cards.  if you think this show is any thing like pokemon your in for a shock, the cute pokemon are no match for the blue eyes white dragon or a man-eater bug. duel monsters are not pets and duelists show little srow at there loss, not to say that duelists do not care for them, all have duel spirt or a card they can conect to. but only being light imges desined by seto they do not realy get hurt or die.   true much random shouting of both player gose on but this keeps plot moving and has you on the edge of your seet to know whos noble couse will be won.   so I like the show the moive and adults should realy stop judging this stuff with out real proff 
 This soundtrack came out the year I graduated from High school. I can remember playing the "cassette" to death in my car and I remember loving the entire soundtrack but was always a bit disappointed that Nik Kershaw's version of "Wouldn't It Be Good" wasn't used on this set. While Danny Hutton Hitters is okay, the original is far superior.   Surprisingly, nobody has mentioned Echo & the Bunnymen's "Bring on the Dancing Horses" which is my personal favorite selection on this soundtrack. It is hauntingly beautiful and still gives me chills to this day when I hear it.    The Smith's "Please Please Please" was for me the beginning of a long melancholy relationship with that band. I recently saw Morrissey in concert and he can still create a mood.. "Shellshock" by New Order and "Left of Center" by Vega and Jackson and of course the title track are wonderful too.   It doesn't get better or more 80's than The P-Furs, New Order, OMD, The Smiths, INXS and Echo. This collection showcases some of their better songs and it all flows together in perfect harmony during a time when things well...weren't so bad.             
 I was surprised that the album was as good as it was, considering its discounted price.  Luckily, I was able to preview some of the songs on Amazon.com, enough to make me feel comfortable making my purchase 
 Bukowski is strangely powerful. If you examine sentence structure you will be disappointed in his sometimes three or four word sentences, if you love lofty language and symbols you will be disappointed by his vulgarity and straightforwardness. If you are a moralist... well, you're in trouble. But yet, this book, and the three others of his I have read are filled with honesty, grittiness and something essentially modern and American that I cannot define. Women, is about Henry Chinaski's (Bukowski's fictional alter ego) dealings and escapades with women when he was finding increasing renown as a poet and writer. It is funny, disturbing, vulgar, but also it shows his vulnerability and despair. It's Bukowski at his best 
 This is a wonderful Beginners book! It is also a good one to keep in your beading book library! It's step by step instructions will help you will all sorts of basic stringing projects. Also has a lot of tips on what type of clasps and findings to use! Overall is really Good 
 I read the Herriot books years and years ago. I learned that my husband had not. So when he needed more "going to sleep" books that could be read in short sections and would let him fall pleasantly to sleep after a few chapters, I ordered all the "Bright and Beautiful, Wise and Wonderful" series for him. After the first bedtime with the first one, he kept it next to him all day, to read just one more chapter when he had a few minutes free. He regales me with some of the tales that I have since forgotten, so I plan to re-read these wonderful snapshots of life, location, people, and animals for myself. They are actually even more refreshing now than when they first delighted me 30 years ago 
 This book is titled ' the one- hundred best loved poems' .By whom? All the poems are by writers in English? Are there any other languages and people in the world?  Secondly. Where is the evidence that  these poems are the most loved even by English language readers? Many are certainly very popular, frequently anthologized. My guess is that today a fair share of the poems in this anthology are not widely read. Now that I have been a grump, let me say that the anthology is rich with great, and certainly some of the most loved poems in the English language. In fact some of these poems have been published so many times in so many different anthologies one wonders what ( except for the price of the volume) is the advantage of reading them here.  Nonetheless any collection of great poetry is a celebration. And there is much great poetry here . Go down the list of the major anthologies of English and American poetry, and you will find the poets listed here.   
 While no Scream, Valentine still manages to rise above other horror films like I Know What you Did Last Summer and the like.  It's not original by any means, but it makes the regurgitated scare tactics it uses seem somewhat fresh and with a cast as beautiful as this one your willing for forgive the many mistakes.  The film follows a group of friends as they try and decide who is trying to kill them.  These girls were all horridly mean to a boy in school and it appears that he has come back on Valentines day to exact his revenge.  As the body count rises their fear grows stronger, and with a large Valentine bash on the way things start to escelate rappidly.  It's far from perfect but it's far from dull and that counts for a lot.  It's a nice deversion from the mundane and serves up some decent scares, some hot bodies and some bloody aftermaths (if your into that kinda thing, and judging on the fact your interested in this type of film tells me you are).  Recommended for any fan of the Scream franchise and the like 
 Yeah, yeah, it's really lame to buy a book about them and all, but this isn't just another stupid ripoff fan book- this is really good stuff.  It's funny.  It's sad.  It gives Courtney a chance to look less evil- I changed  my mind about her because of this book.  And it's not just about Kurt like  most Nirvana books are- there's a good amount of stuff on Krist and the  various drummers as well.  Serious Nirvana fans really need to read this 
 A&E and BBC have produced a beautiful adaptation of the R. D. Blackmore classic novel.  I was surprised and enthralled with the protagonists here, namely the talented Richard Coyle, but more on that later.  Lorna Doone tells the story of John Ridd, an honest farmer who wants revenge against the Doone family for killing his father when he was a child.  Then he reunites with beautiful Lorna, whom he met briefly when they were children.  Now she's a beautiful young woman and falls in love with her.  But then he discovers that she is a Doone.  Will love override his desire for revenge?  In the course of the story, we discover various secrets and mysteries, and John Ridd will not give up until he has sought revenge against Calver Doone, his father's killer and the man Lorna has been forced to be betrothed with.  This film has it all -- romance, intrigue, adventure, villains and tragedy.  I read the novel quite some years ago, but I remember some of it and the film remained faithful to the book for the most part. I was entertained from beginning to end.  I also like the backdrop of the Restoration era and the beautiful scenery of England and Wales.  The acting is also great.  The beautiful Amelia Warner is wonderful as Lorna Doone.  I enjoyed the dark and handsome Aidan Gillen as the villainous Carver Doone.  Carver is hateful and brutal -- the perfect villain.  But the most surprising one of all here is Richard Coyle in his role of John Ridd.  I know Coyle for his memorable role as the goofy and sex-obsessed Jeff in BBC's Coupling, one of my all-time favorite sitcoms.  This role is such a shift from his comedic role of Jeff.  In here, he is the proverbial hero -- handsome, honorable, conflicted and romantic.  I am impressed with this actor and I look forward to seeing him in more productions in the future.  Anyway, going back to the story, I loved the twist at the end and I was almost in tears.  The acting during those scenes surprised me much.  I recommend this A&E/BBC film.  North and South remains my all-time favorite period drama, but this one will also be kept on the shelves to be watched again and again.  There are faults of course. One of the actresses who plays John's sister had salon-perfect blond highlights in a film set in seventeenth century.  Why some actors don't sacrifice their personal appearance for the sake of time period accuracy is beyond me.  Also, the acting during the first stage of the film (when John and Lorna were children) is kind of poor.  Things improve once the main characters come in.  I also wish this were available in widescreen format.  The full screen format isn't very good in a modern 16.9 LCD TV screen and the film's DVD transfer isn't so good either.  Other than that, this is a definite must see 
 My 14 month old loves this book.  We read it to him every night. It's one of his favorites. If you're an admirer of Sandra Boynton books, get her volume two collection which includes this book 
 It is a little on the pricey side but it is worth it. The bottle turns darker blue with the sunlight. It is not greasy like many other sunscreens 
 I bought this book about 10 years ago and although I have dozens more on landscaping, none can compare with Ms. Kesslers style, colors and textures.  I had the privilege of participating in one of Ms. Kessler's seminars at  Pocono Pines Pennsylvania several years ago--what a treat! I wish she would  write another book 
 This is a goooood book. Very inspiring. Easy and quick to read. Well laid out, so I can go back and re-read stuff; like her great reading suggestions! I'm going to throw the word gentle in here. It's as if she's right there holding your hand and encouraging you....I mean me. Good, good, good 
 I recently bought this book from our local food coop to learn about tvp and how to use it...my wife and I have found it to be very informative.     I've shared several of the recipes with my co- workers.    The book is well  written and easy to understand...the title could have been "tvp for  dummies".  I highly reccomend this book to all 
 Many book are interesting to read, and then you forget all about them. Not "The MsSpent Money Guide," which I refer to over and over again. It is a book that has changed my life. Most of us feel helpless before ubiquitous money problems. Deborah Knuckey's book teaches you that you can be in charge of your financial welfare, that you are the architect of your future, and that you can be as well off moneywise as you want to be. She says, "Why spend so much of your life working if you don't use your earning in a way that makes you ahppy? Even if you love your job, most work is siimply not that much fun that we'd do it purely for the joy of it. So take the payment for your work and put it to your own best use." Knuckey believes that each of us has different life values, and it is foolish to go along with everyone else's. What mattters, she writes, is that your spending fit your own needs and not that of the Joneses. Some people like fine clothes, others could care less what they wear. Some of us enjoy eating in fine restaurants, others prefer cooking at home.Whatever it is that you enjoy, that is what you should be spending your money on. What matters is not how much money you have, but that it is invested in what will make you happy. Deborah Knuckey will teach you haow to do it. Don't miss reading this book, if you want to enjoy life to the fullest 
 Wonderful expression of the Oklahoma spirit, mindset and humor! A terrific place and a delightful book 
 Well, I just closed the back cover and sighed.  Once again, Denise Hildreth took me to a place I want to visit, let me linger with people I don't want to leave, and made me wish for just another chapter.  All while causing me to scratch my head and ponder what I might need to look at in my own life.  I read all kinds of fiction.  But few authors take me to places inside myself.  Thank you again for giving us, your readers a satisfying way of having spent both our money and our time.  We will tell our friends.  It's the least we can do!  
 Suzanne Vale is troubled but very appealing and relatable in this first incarnation. Her wit is sharp and speaks to issues most women have but few will acknowledge. The first time I read this I was fairly blown away by the insight and brutal honesty, and more importantly the wry approach to both. I felt vindicated in seeing some of my issues validated by Suzanne's unabashed articulation of them (The "Why? Why would you think I would want to know that?" exchange... "What is it about me that looks like I would want to know there are other smart pretty girls? Because I'll fix it. I'll change it. Is it something I'm wearing? Is my lip curled in a certain way that says, 'Got to tell her there's another bright woman around'? Why would you think I would want to know that a beautiful, gorgeous, supermarket-famous face from television is as bright and funny as I am?")  One of the earlier passages taking us first-person through a fellow drug rehab patient's series of rationalizations that takes him from swearing off drugs through doing endless hits of coke and following that up with ecstasy, heroin and whatever was in his dealer's medicine cabinet was really quite impressively executed; its few pages were far more potent than the entire D.A.R.E. program ever was.  Re-reading this years later and after reading "The Best Awful," I felt that "Postcards" was a little too self-congratulatory re: the protagonist's clever rejoinders. But I think my mid-'90s 25-year-old self would still find it seminal and deeply resonant. 
 This is an exceptional book of introductory through intermediate levels of astronomy sophistication.  The author has continued in his enthusiastic style of presenting a wide spectrum of information through pictures, charts, and discussion.  It is beautifully illustrated, current, and user-friendly.  In a very short order, a novice will be feeling comfortable with the field of astronomy from a practical stance, and the more experienced will be impressed with the quality that will still appeal to them.  This is one book that needs to be on your shelf 
 I adore this cookbook.  The photographs are beautiful, the story behind each recipe is fascinating, the explanations are clear and the results are  superb.  I am awed by Marcella Hazan's ability to take simple ingredients  and create fantastic results with sheer technique and attention to details,  such as slicing vs. chopping garlic, sauteing certain ingredients for a  long time and adding others for a short time, using butter here and olive  oil there and even just plain vegetable oil at other times.  There are two  summer pasta sauces with nearly identical ingredients, and, as Marcella  points out, completely different results.  I have made almost all of the  sauces and none have  been less than delicious.  I have discovered the joy  of pancetta thanks to this book.  I have learned how to make risotto, very  good and not all that difficult.  Now I am venturing into the meats - the  beef stew with capers, cornichons and pancetta was amazing.  I have learned  alot about good cooking from this book, and not just of Italian food.   Marcella's cooking is alive and accessible and completely masterful at the  same time 
 The other reviewers obviously are liberal defenders of the Clintons. This book should not even be necessary when considering all the Clinton crimes: Bill's perjury before a Grand Jury, his impeachment, to name a couple. But it is necessary because the American public has a short memory and the liberal media plans to get her elected President no matter how much they have to lie and cover up her/his sins 
 In this surprising and polished work about politics and ethics, Patricia Anthony has written a book that deserves to be much more widely known and read than it appears to be. If you like smart fiction which plays with genre rules (rather than within them) then I suggest that you hurry and find a copy of Brother Termite.  Brother Termite is a story about Reen, an overworked alien bureaucrat in the White House who has to contend with seemingly every problem in the world-- hidden agendas from practially everybody, unreliable friends and lovers, and the annoying ghost of John F. Kennedy. The aliens and humans are caught in a mesh of competing personalities and ethical priorities-- a knotty problem  which seems like it could lead to a failure of diplomacy...  Anthony has done a very clever thing and written a book which functions very well within both the Thriller and Science Fiction genres without ever actually losing its critical distance from either. It is a rare book that can be satisfying on stock levels (political whodunnit, alien anthropology) while still remaining a cool parody of the books that it is based on and the culture it comes from.  Do not read Anthony looking for your typical space opera. Her books are strongly character-based and ultimately more interested in human issues than xenobiology or battles. If you like the work of Mary Doria Russell, Bruce Sterling, or Philip K. Dick then you are probably on the right page for Anthony.  (I am sad to note, by the way, that her work seems to be out of print at the time of writing this review. I would stress that it is well worth the extra time and trouble to find copies while they are still available. 
 Mark Bittman cooks like a lot of us do. We start with a recipe and then change this, add a bit more of that, and we come up with favorites that suit our tastes and those of our family. This is probably offensive to some food purists that insist a recipe should be followed exactly, with exactly the same ingredients. If you are the purist type, this is not the book for you. Otherwise:   Here are more than a thousand recipies, ideas where you will start your own cooking. I first turned to Polenta (we southerners call them grits, the Romanians call them mamaliga) and there are four different recipies. Some of these I've seen before but never tried. His explanation is so simple that this weekend I have to try it. There's a southerner coming over to diner. (I wonder what his wife, a Montana girl will think.) The four recipies take up just over a page in the book. There are no pretty pictures, just recipies.   That's the strengths of this book. I don't need the pretty pictures. I want new ideas of things that look like I'd want to cook them and that my friends would want to eat.   Ummm! The book just fell open to a recipie on how to make your own ginger ale, and his comment, 'incredible with run.' Should I do that this weekend, or perhaps wait until the weather gets hot 
 I recently took up sailing and bought this book, along with some others, as a general reference to accompany my lessons.  The first time I read it through it seemed OK but nothing special, but having now acquired some skills it is really becoming useful.  Every time I re-read it (as I have done several times) the amount of detail and practical information seems to increase, and that is not necessarily the case with other books.  The author has packed an immense amount of information into a small book, but it is best for refreshing the memory or consolidating practical knowledge learned in lessons - sort of a second opinion.  Reading Seidman after a lesson is like going to visit an old sailor who straightens everything out for you.  It is not, however, the best book for absolute beginners, simply because it is so very packed with concise information, and a lot goes over the neophyte's head.  For absolute beginners the very best books are the RYA (Royal Yachting Association) sailing series - they are exceptional 
 In The Sorrows of Empire Chalmers Johnson has compiled and constructed a brilliant analysis of United States military policy and its history, as well as evolution, of imperialistic tendencies.  The book presents an overwhelming amount of superbly done research as well as an incredible array of statistical information to buttress the arguments that Johnson wishes to promulgate.  Most importantly, Johnson is providing an increasingly unaware world population, especially and most-importantly that of the American contingent, with information and analysis that is being progressively more and more silenced by mass media conglomerations and the U.S. Government's Orwellian methods of knowledge distribution and censorship. 	 Johnson starts his book off with a very thorough examination of the history of U.S. foreign policy, roots of imperialism, and an illumination behind much of the motivation for classic shifts in the direction of the U.S. methods of international engagement.  I found this section of the book to be one of the more interesting, because it provided me with some foundational understanding for some of the current direction of U.S. policy.  Because most American students and laypeople's understanding of U.S. history regarding the military and foreign policy is antiseptically produced by major U.S. publishing companies, information that Johnson elucidates in The Sorrows of Empire is as vitally important to an educated public as it is unsettling to the average persons' consciousness.   	 Branching out from his discussion of history, Johnson moves on to discuss the sheer numbers involved regarding the U.S. military hegemony.  Unfortunately, as much as these chapters of the book are extremely important to a full understanding of U.S. militarism, I found that the sections are so full of facts and statistical information that they began to read like VCR manuals.  However, in wading through the numbers, estimates, pricings, and projections, I've found that not only did I not know how pervasive the military establishment was, but that the world is essentially dotted and monitored by an unfortunate web of U.S. military concrete and steel.  	 I was perhaps most impressed by the fact that Johnson did not stop at the exposing of the military establishment at home and abroad, but rather he continues to discuss the terrible inequality and hardship that has come as a result of current neoliberal tendencies in the form of domestic and international economic free-market fundamentalist policy design.  Johnson goes on to discuss how the U.S.' hypocritical non-market funding and deployment of the military regime cooperates with the self-benefiting establishment and execution of institutions such as the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund to provide for world-wide economic hegemony of the ruling Capitalist economic states.  While, this may not be the way he describes it, at its fundamental level this is the contradictory relationship the U.S. and its "allies" in exploitation have chosen as the most effective route to strip-mining the Third World.   	 The Sorrows of Empire in its final pages appeals to the American people to attempt to at the very least be mindful of the reality with which it has presented throughout the previous analyses.  Unfortunately, Johnson does not provide much in the way of useful suggestion to create positive global social change and eradicate the massive military establishment, but he does warn that it may soon be too late, if it is not already, to redirect the course of the United States away from that of all previous empires.  Johnson warns the American public against the possibilities of casting the die and crossing the Rubicon, and we should all be listening.   
 I never thought this would ever make it to cd. This is one killer cd, a 3 man powerhouse that could stand up to any others of this time period. Brilliant guitarwork. A must-have for hard rock fans 
 This is an intriguing book. Optimize Your Operation is no quick "once over" on operations. It begins with the basic principles needed to understand and improve processes. Abbott's approach to the principles is  not ordinary and his explanation of the details is not ordinary. He  certainly is moving us up a notch in the way we think about processes and  the way we manage them. It is not the same old same old. Yet his language  and illustrations are easy to follow. His thoughts take us from how we get  ourselves into and out of "Quality Hells" all the way to how a  better understanding of strategic and tactical decision-making will change  our organizations. I think it is an important read for those who are faced  with changing their operations to meet today's tough markets 
 Some serious throw-down goin' on in this book. I got back into comics right around the time New Avengers was launched. I hate not knowing back story, so this was a good book for me to get in on. (Granted, there's the entire history of the Avengers, but I'll settle for this new jumping off point.)   Laying down the premise for the new team - i.e., a huge knock-down-drag-out - the art in the first issues is detailed and stunning. I had to stare for a while to take it all in. It took me a couple issues to warm up to the art (having started reading in later books), but these first issues definitely nailed New Avengers down as one of my favorite books.   I was really skeptical about Spidey being in the new team, but with the developments from The Other arc, I think his character will be fleshed out to have the more adult-like depth and complexity that the other Avengers have. In the first issues, he still seems like a wise-cracking young guy with a supermodel wife. That said, Amazing Spider-man makes an awesome supplementary read. I also picked up Captain America vol. 1 at the same time as this book. Also a good supplement for getting to know the individual characters.  I'm still skeptical about Wolverine, but if you need something killed .. 
 This is the American recording to get.  It's what Cash wanted to sing in the first place. A little gospel and some hard edged life observations.  I listen to it every day 
 This movie was a perfectly balanced psycho thriller, Seven is a flawless masterpiece it's my favourite movie of all time and one of the best film i have ever seen in my life. The actor and actress were well balanced this cast was perfect the storyline creative intense and beautiful, i think that this movie made me a Kevin Spacey fan, the same for all the other actors starring in this movie i must say that Brad pitt and Morgan Freeman will never ever do a better film that this one, mere words can't describe this movie you must see it and experience it for yourself, you must have this in your collection must! " it one of those film that you never ever forget" laters folks 
 I highly recommend this wonderful God-given book! I am a former Weigh Down Workshop coordinator, was searching for a less condemning approach, and God led me to this book! The "Hunger Scale" is easy to abide by and the spiritual approach is very inspiring, uplifting, and healing. I believe the answer most people struggling with weight control is looking for; it certainly was for me!  It is written in a format that can be used personally or in a small support-type group setting 
 Gibbon's "Decline and Fall" is without a doubt one of the most well-written and truly comprehensive historical works concerning the Roman Empire.  From the military maneuvers of the northern legions to the intrigues of the Imperial Court, Gibbon showcases the history of Rome as it unfolded--often relying on the eyewitness testimony of contemporary writers to give readers a sense of the passions and policies of the time.  There are a few minute problems--or rather gaps--in Gibbon's work, but given that he originally published in the late 1700's we can excuse his lack of complete information.  Overall, an excellent read and a great history of such an important subject 
 The most striking thing about this film is the fact that this is actually a real story. This makes you set high expectations. You want to feel what the characters feel, you want to be part of it. Then there is this "horse thing" about the film. People who love those animals will be blind to the shortcomings of this film.  To me, this film is inspiring and disappointing at the same time. The cast is magnificent. The locations are spectacular. So are even the props. The race scenes look very real and very convincing (except for Seabiscuit's accident with the 2nd jockey, which is only hinted at, not actually shown). The film has all it takes to become a classic, and yet it won't, because it fails to live up to this unbelievable, touching true story.  The main reason I think is this chaotic storytelling in about the first half of the film. The cuts are amateurish. It kills the story and the performance the cast may have delivered does not carry over to the film. I was quite disappointed with the director's explanations for this kind of storytelling. In the Extras he speaks about his way of doing things and it actually tells you everything. Fractured, even "disjointed" is actually a fitting word for his way of thinking on this film and the storytelling.   Whoever else would have directed this film could have hardly delivered a worse performance. This is a magnificent story worthy of a magnificent film, not such a half-baked cut as is the case here.   As long as there is no other film on this, I suggest you buy this one and see for yourself. The story will cheer you up.   Or buy the book 
 Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo seems to be a very good product. I noticed a difference the first time I used it -- there was no residue on my scalp, and my flakiness was greatly reduced. It produced a very rich lather, also. The only thing I didn't like about it was the possibility that I'd have an allergic reaction to the ingredients, but the instructions didn't tell which ingredients might make this happen. I, myself, am sensitive to many products, and didn't have any reaction to the ingredients of the shampoo. I would recommend this product to others 
 After quickly destroying 4 cell phones from the dollar store, I bought two of these cell phones for the younger 2 boys of our 4 children.  I wish I had bought one for each of our children, ages 2-8.  The phone allows you to record and play back a short message.  We've had lots of fun getting creative with that feature.  Also, about 30 seconds after you close the phone, it will ring back.  It makes the phone seem more "real".  I originally didn't buy this phone for our oldest two girls, ages 6 and 8, because I thought maybe it was too childish or too drab in color for them.  But, they are constantly playing with these phones and I have been trying to find more locally, but have been unsuccessful so far.  We added stickers to personalize the phones, so the girls could make theirs more "girly" that way.  I've not seen any other toy cell phone as nice as this one 
 For anyone interested in knowing how was it like to live under the rule of the great New Kingdom Pharaohs of Egypt, this is the book. With grace and elegant style, Dr. James gifted us with a wonderful overview of everyday life taking as evidence the registers from tomb and temple wallpaintings and inscriptions, from which he has taken nice and amusing "bites of reality". There are texts from private and official letters and bussiness-documents; everything was masterly handed by the great British Egyptologist, so as to let us recover a lively glimpse of ancient Egyptians and their way-of-life in those golden ages 
 A little 'spacey' at times but it really grew on me after a few listens.  I wasn't a bit MMJ fan but gave this a shot anyway.  It is now my favorite of theirs I like it better with every listen.  Nothing new to add from the other reviews but did want to give this great album 5 stars to counter all the 'non-reviews' that are just griping about the DRM software on the CD.  PLEASE AMAZON, do something about the people who are not reviewing the product so much as airing their grips with record labels.  It hurts the artist (and there are easy and well published ways around the DRM).  
 I've just read through a couple of the other reviews here (which I do sometimes) and I have to say I agree with some of the more nasty reviews, though I disagree with their conclusions. Parker's a really disciplined writer, someone who writes fast (reportedly he does 20-25 pages a day, now, and three books plus a year) and cleanly, without almost any extraneous plot or characters in his work. He's been back in form lately (Apaloosa was very good) and this is his latest Spenser book, part of what's got to be the longest running series in detective fiction these days. They can't give him any more awards (I think they made him a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers Guild or whatever it is a decade or so ago) and so he just soldiers on, putting his grandchildren through Harvard and piling up the CDs.  What makes the book good is one of the points where I do agree with some of the reviewers. I don't particularly agree that Susan is a weakness of the series: frankly Parker's portrayal of Spenser, and what made the character unique from early on, is that he *isn't* a loner. That was a departure from Chandler, Hammett, Ross and John D. MacDonald, and all the other private eye writers up to the 60s. The idea of one of those writers having a character with a permanent relationship is almost inconceivable (the exception is Hammett's Nick and Nora Charles, but they were only in The Thin Man) and so Parker was breaking the mold when he did that. It's also generally agreed that almost splitting the detective character in twain by adding Hawk as an alter ego to Spenser was brilliant. This book avoids both of those plot conventions of Parker's, and is in many ways a more traditional book, though of course setting and even plot are much more contemporary than any of the above-mentioned author's books.  The plot is rather pretty much standard Parker. There's been another school shooting, and somehow one of the shooters got away. The other was caught, and gave up his friend. The grandmother of the second boy is very wealthy and determined, and hires Spenser to look into the matter, and prove her grandson innocent. Spenser, of course, can't prove anything of the sort, but he does try to find out why the whole thing happened, something the cops can't determine.  I enjoyed this book a great deal. As I said, it's somewhat more characteristic of earlier works, but I think if I had read the book without Spenser's or any of the other names in it, I still would have been able to tell who the author was. The writing style is very distinctive 
 Once again, the folks at Baseball Prospectus have tried to (re)examine the basic precepts of winning baseball.  Once again, they have succeeded.  The naysaying reviewers criticizing everything from political jibes (I think I saw *2* in the whole book) to a supposedly *obvious* point (Rivera being solved by the Sox due to their familiarity with him) are being hypercritical.  There are plenty of announcers out there (the likes of Joe Morgan and such) who would NEVER draw the conclusion on Rivera that BP has.  I *liked* the essay format, as a distinct change of pace from the "on April 15, they did this ... on April 21 they did that" tomes.  The book DID have a flow to it, logically and chronologically.  Analyses were sensibly connected to what the Sox were dealing with at the time ... injuries, brawls, offense vs. defense.  The "stathead" stats were presented with a minimum of "even if you don't understand it ... just go along with it".  There was a *logic* to the presentation.  The one thing I do have an issue with (and it has been said before) is some sloppy editing, particularly in latter chapters.  Typos, disjointed sentences and factual errors made for some difficult reading at times.  I know the final piece of the book was written in early August for an October release, but it still irks me a bit.  This is a daring attempt to present a recap of one team's season in a new format.  I think we should be offering them congrats. 
 Great kit! makes installation very easy. seller doesn't specify Qty. per kit, I found out the hard way that every kit is for a pair of speakers and not one 
 Goldie, who plays Helen Sharp, a plain Jane, introduces her fiance' ( A nerdy Bruce Willis) to her lifelong "friend" Madeline Ashton ( A has been movie star played by Meryl Streep) and the fun begins!  Earnest promptly dumps Helen, and marries Madeline. This drives Helen over the edge and she has a nervous breakdown, and also gains about 100 lbs.  Years pass, and suddenly Madeline and Earnest get invited to a promotional book party for Helens book "Forever Young"- At the party Madeline expects to see a fat Helen, and instead there is a beautiful, slim, and youthful Helen there. Unknown to Madeline, Helen has taken a potion that reverses the aging process, and makes makes you young and beautiful again.  Madeline happens upon this same potion later on, and also drinks it. From bickering and fighting, both women end up dead, but are still walking and talking and very much alive! (At the time this film was made, there were some ground breaking special effects , such as: Goldie walking around with a huge hole through her mid section, and Meryl's head twisted all the way around, and facing backwards)  Anyway, they go on to try and make Earnest drink the potion, because after all, they are BLUE by this time, and need Earnest to PAINT them (He IS a mortician afterall)  Things get more and more hilarious as the movie rolls along, and there is one wild chase as they try to get Earnest to drink the potion,too.  The main thing I will say for this film is:  It was back then, and still is the most ORIGINAL I have seen ever! Also it is nice to see these 3 talented people and especially Meryl here, play a character so OUT of character. She normally is in such SERIOUS roles that it is refreshing to see them play in such a fun, crazy romp as this.  I guarantee if you see this movie, you will love it, and laugh nonstop 
 When I saw March of the Penguins I thought it was extremely cool.  The penguins are so fat and cute. I would love to have a penguin for a pet, but I know I can't. My mom and I fell in love with the movie. It is extremely cool how real scientists videoed them in Antarctica. I would love to do that. I liked watching the penguins slide on their bellies. It looks like fun. The movie was also a little bit sad, but I did not care about that. This movie taught me so much about how penguins live and about how they survive in Antartica. Thank you so much for this DVD. 
 This version of Oh Holy Night will go down in history as the best and most intense and beautiful version of this song ever done. Its arrangement is incredible. The orchestra's strings together with her voice's heart-felt inflections of the songs climaxes, at the spots where the words mean the most, will bring you to cry. Destined to be the song that all others are judged by, this CD is definatly worth the price for this song alone. If I could rate the song I'd give it 10 stars. Perfection 
 I found practical suggestions in each chapter -- a useful resource to help us round out our fund raising program. With uncertainties in the Washington, DC mail due to anthrax, we are especially interested in increasing visits and gifts through our Web site.  This book will help us move towards that goal 
 Adams always is a delight to read.  While Adams is not perfect he is passionate about the right things and hits the nail on the head on almost every issue.  He blazed the trail for modern noutetic counseling.  Those who have expressed problems with this book do not have the high view of Scripture that Adams holds and do not understand the depravity of man as the Bible teaches.  They also do not understand how the presuppostions of psychology are anti-Christian and they do not bring glory to God.  This is a very practical book that is a good read for all Christians who seek to restore their bretheren (Gal. 6 
 I was given this book when I was two by my grandmother, a librarian.  I have poured over this book from the very first day it was given to me.  First, looking at the pictures and having my parents read the nursery rhymes. In elementary school,  I began to read it myself.  By late elementary school through high school, the book had become a useful reference.  I still have the one given to me by my grandmother and absolutely treasure it.  I look forward to sharing my book with my soon-to-be born first child.  This collection covers everything from nursery rhymes to Shakespeare.  Wonderful illustrations and a great collection of poetry, which doesn't believe that children are too young to grasp the meaning of the poems 
 I loved Little Women and this book just confirms what a wonderful writer she was. Lots of hidden truths and wisdoms 
       Dr. Pat Robertson is history's 2nd most remarkable man. His book Miracles Can Be Yours Today can be a tremendous spiritual blessing to anyone who reads it, is simply willing to believe The Bible, and boldly step out in faith on their life's journey. The power of God, Christ, The Holy Spirit, and The Holy Scriptures has been, are, and will be available to change lives for the better, as Dr. Robertson teaches with illustrations in his book! I strongly encourage you to read it, as well as share it with others 
 I found this movie on Netflix.  I was totally unaware that it existed. Normally I am not a fan of war movies. In criticism the film does have a couple of low budget tricks.  The plot and the acting are extremely good.It will hold your attention to the explosive end. Fascinating subject matter. David McCallum excellently underplays his role 
 Alan Banks is still recovering from the fire that destroyed his home and possessions.  He is on holiday, when he receives a telephone call from his brother, wanting Alan to contact him urgently.  While he is off to London trying to contact his brother, who seems to have disappeared, a young woman is murdered near his home.  He and Annie play telephone tag as the two cases come together.  The novel seems to start out a bit slow, but is hard to put down by the time you get to the halfway point and events start coming together.  It deals with sordid issues, like white slavery and worse.  Investigation into one case provides leads on another case.  There is a question as to whether Banks will revert to Law West of the Pecos (frontier justice based on community standards).  What do you do if there is a particularly heinous crime, and the guilty party may walk away from it?  Banks comes out of it whole, but without a woman.  Perhaps he has burned too many bridges.  The novel is set in the UK, so be prepared to deal with the King's English.  They use different terms for some things (compared to American English).  
 When I was in high school, one of my friends, who was also a Disney fan, advised me to listen to this album. He downloaded "Under the Sea" for me, and I listened to it over and over again, because it was wonderful! Then I decided to add this album to my music collection! In this album, many pop stars sang some well-known Disney songs in their own ways, it made this album extroardinary! "Under the Sea" was the first song I heard and one of the best in this album. What I love most was the vocal, I've never heard this song sung with lady vocal before I listened to this! The girl's voice was so sweet! If it wasn't for the song "Beauty and the Beast" in this album, I wouldn't know the music group named Jump5, and wouldn't know how great they are! I saw the music video of this song in "Beauty and the Beast" platinum edition DVD, it was good! Hilary Duff might be very well-known to many Disney fans. "The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room" she performed was more wonderful than the original version! After I heard this song, I collected some of her music albums. To my surprise, Aaron Carter sang a song from one of my favourite movie "The Lion King" in this album! And it was fantastic! "Kiss the Girl" No Secrets performed was lovely too. This song which's original version was comical, became so cute when it was sung with 5-lady vocal! I've heard the Christina Aguilera version "Reflection" long ago, but in my opinion, it still can not be compared with the original version in the movie that Lea Salonga performed. "Part of Your World", one of my favourite Disney song, was performed perfectly in this album. I don't know why many people think the song "I Wanna Be Like You" in this album was bad, I think it was good! If every song was sung in the initial way but sung by another artist, this album wouldn't be so special. However, this album was not perfect, for example, "Some Day My Prince Will Come" was strange, and all the initial romantic feeling lost! And "Colors of the Wind" was not so good as my anticipation. And I thought Usher made "You'll Be in My Heart" a little strange, but needless to say, he's a good singer and I like his voice. However, I still think this album was collectable to every Disney fan, and all young and adult music fans. Because we can have different feeling which the same song brings! And I advise that every Disney fan to collect all the Disneymania albums 
 Lewis, in Arrowsmith, drew on his family's medical connections (his father, grandfather, older brother and an uncle were all physicians); his boyhood home in Sauk Centre, Minnesota, also served as his father's office, so he must have seen plenty of medicine in action. As others have described, we see the career of a man from boyhood to his early forties, as he transforms from general practitioner to research bacteriologist. Observations:   1). the character types described in medical school (students and faculty), small city medical practice and research facility are uncannily true to form (my experience as physician), more so than can be attributed solely to hearing about it from one's relatives or  informants (in Lewis's case, Dr. Morris Fishbein and bacteriologist/science writer Paul de Kruif) - a mark of Lewis's genius as an author.   2). Sinclair Lewis, as usual, has a tin ear for colloquial dialogue.   3). Arrowsmith is doomed, in each of his employments, by his perfectionism - others, who know better how to compromise, urge him to stay on and even how to do it, but his usual response is "I'm licked!" and on to the next. His one true interest - bacteriological research - endures and grows and eventually pushes any humanity out of his life. Even his penultimate experience in combatting plague on a West Indian island is regretted, not for the death of his loyal wife, but because he compromised the scientific method in how he administered the bacteriophage therapy. In the end, his second wife and son are turned away for a monastic-like life in the wilds.    4). If this is an heroic character - and Lewis is on record as saying he thought so - then it says something about the author. There seems to be a lot of Sinclair Lewis in Martin Arrowsmith - both keen, but heartless, observers - and indeed, there are several parallels between the two - the weakness Arrowsmith has for the bottle at various stages, his scorn for religion and its practitioners, and his womanizing, for example. (Lewis was an alcoholic and was twice divorced). Lewis elsewhere has been described as a proto-feminist, but any sympathy he has for the female gender is a little like Marx's sympathy for the working class - more in theory than in practice (which may be said about feminism in general). The truly pathetic character in this novel is Dr. Arrowsmith's first wife, who  sacrifices her own life and sticks to him in spite of his selfishness - and who winds up buried in a backyard on some fetid Caribbean island. Lewis and his hero both seem to try to develop some sympathy for her, without much success.   5). Lewis was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for this novel, but refused it.  Evidence is that at least part of the basis for this was that he was miffed over the failure of Main Street and Babbitt to win it.   
 I love these songs. I love the Ronnettes. When you really enjoy something then you can also be honest with it. These songs need to and should be sonically enhanced.  The wall of sound vibe however has not transfered well with new technology. Ironically, on cd, the music sounds tinny.   With the essence of "Be My Baby" being the defining drum intro, I wish these songs were re-mastered. The drums, guitar chords, singing, harmonizing should leap out more. Mono is very antiquated. Perhaps if Phil Spector was not a wack job, the old masters could have been used to spruce up the songs?  When you listen to re-mastered Motown or Stax/Volt, it sounds great and real raw. This sounds like a transister radio even on cd.  I would like Ronnie to cut a live album playing many of these songs with her current young and gritty band. An organic treatment of these songs would do them justice.   They are beautiful songs but they are also true slices of rock and roll. I think that is why this music still get attention from people that were not around when they played. This stuff is timeless 
 My son's teacher used to have a saying - "you're mad, too bad".  I thought it was mean.  Now it's one of my mantras.  This book helped me figure out when people in my life where using their anger to manipulate me.  It helped me figure out why I was mad and how to figure out what to do with it.  The best part was learning about triangles and how to remove myself from them.     All my relationships have improved immensely.  I've since bought Harriet Lerner's other books and they are just as excellent 
 this is a great reference book for the beginner & the "expert". Recommeded to keep in your own personal library of books 
 I have just started Laurell K Hamilton's series and am completely hooked! Her Anita Blake is a tough cookie.  The action is intense and very gory, so if you are not the type that cares for blood, this is not for you.  The Circus of the Damned, like most of Hamilton's titles refer to a place, not just a horror subject.  The monsters of Circus of the Damned, are not only vampires, shapeshifters, and werewolves, but other exotic  members, including snake people.  I find it amusing that Hamilton's Anita Blake is labeled as "sci-fi" when it is clearly horror, as if a female writer cannot write in the genre.  Clearly she owns it!  
 One can't help but be touched by the personalities woven in this story.  Far from stereotypes, the characters are given credibility as individuals, each with their own stories, each with their own reasons for action.  Even with the fall of official apartheid, this book goes into the human condition, and with or without governmental promotion, apartheid or something very much like it, will always be with us 
 This world-famous novel is all about love and loss and making choices in marriage. Adam loves Hetty who loves Arthur who is a scoundrel. Hetty gets pregnant by Arthur, who deserts her, despite Adam's efforts to save her. Later Adam marries Dinah, a serious, calm cousin of Hetty's, after his brother Seth unselfishly gives her up. Obviously, this summary is only the tip of the iceberg. Eliot is truthful, moving, intelligent, never dull--this is perhaps her best novel. (I liked it better than "Middlemarch.") Begin reading it and you won't be able to put it down--AND it will stay with you for a very long time afterward 
 i'm a big fan of Aaron. i love his work. and this book is awesome i'm looking forward to more work from him. 
 There is a card for everyone in here, and gentle reminders to love ourselves and be kind to ourselves as we learn and grow 
 SERIOUSLY, One of my favorite movies of all time. Thank goodness for 1980's rewinds. Kate Hudson's character is ridiculous, in the absolute best sense of the word. Oh, and, Martha Plimpton never ages...she's a freak of nature. Now get off the computer and let's go party Risa Garcia style. F*** yeah 
 When Professor von Hardwigg discovers an ancient parchment suggesting a journey to the center of the Earth is possible, he wastes no time dragooning his dubious nephew and ward, Harry, into an expedition, first to Iceland, and then into the Earth.  Harry, a young man, sees no good that can come of this expedition, but dutifully agrees.    So begins one of the most beloved classics of science fiction ever published, Jules Verne's "A Journey to the Center of the Earth".  I'm hardly a Verne expert, but I've read many of his other classics.  "Journey" is unique among his work.  It's one of the few books to feature a first person narrator in the form of Harry.  Moreover, unlike his other books, "Journey" is less grounded in science and more interested in the fantastic.  Verne, through his various characters, slyly implores his readers' indulgence, reminding us that there is plenty about the center of the world we don't know.    Verne was an author who dealt in archetypal characters.  From "20,000 Leagues Under the Seas" on, Verne generally concentrated on three types of characters as his protagonists:  the brilliant and calm professor; the professor's loyal apprentice, and; the non-scientific, cantankerous, pragmatic, but steadfast man of action.  Here, Verne mixes and matches these traits, making for a more interesting cast.  Hardwigg is a brilliant scientist, but he's also a ball of barely restrained emotion and energy, demanding his fellow travelers press on, perhaps beyond all reason.  The man of action, the Icelandic Hans, is loyal, but by no means cantankerous.  He simply does what must be done, and is unsteady in his loyalty.  Finally, Harry, rather than the unquestioning apprentice, is quite skeptical of this expedition.  Hardly steadfast, he proves to be quite cowardly and panics at inopportune times.  Thus, with these interesting characters in the mix, the plot of the novel proves frequently unpredictable.  While the premise is fantastic, the action of the novel is far less concerned with monsters that might be found at the center of the earth than the more realistic, albeit more mundane, threats of natural disaster.  Rather than being chased by dinosaurs or hidden cave-men, our heroes must deal with being lost, the threat of starvation, underground lakes, exhaustion, and exposure.  Naturally, just as all hope seems lost for our heroes, fortune takes a hand.  Obviously, if Harry is narrating, they probably get out okay.  Still, there are some moments of true white knuckle tension, as Harry is lost in the caverns, or the trio finds itself on a raft with only a piece of jerky as their food-supply.    Wisely, Verne lets the scientific explanations he used as the basis of his other novels go here.  He's less interested in giving his reader an education in the latest discovery, and concentrates instead on a great rip-roaring read.  Admittedly, the conventions of Victorian-era fiction don't always allow the book to rip or roar.  The first third of the book is actually dedicated to getting Harry and the Professor to Iceland and recruiting an expedition.  It's more of a travelogue than an adventure tale, which makes the book more realistic, although not consistently exciting.  Once our heroes are underground, however, the book takes off.    In the grand scheme of things, "A Journey to the Center of the Earth" is probably not my favorite Verne book.  It lacks a remarkable character, like Captain Nemo.  It also lacks some of the sharper satire Verne brought to his other books, like "From the Earth to the Moon."  It doesn't quite have the pacing of "Around the World in 80 Days."  Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable and charming read, and certainly has earned its place among the classics.    
 Here we are again! The Napoleon era with Nelson's navy at war with France. Does it get any better! These are truly fine crafted productions, shot on wonderful locations with a great cast. If you have enjoyed the series up to this point, you will certainly not be dissapointed with these latest installments. We have a more mature Hornblower living on & off land and his first real romance [besides the sea]. I can hardly wait until more of these are produced 
 The style may seem quaint, but if you have spent any time at all reading scholarly works from this time period, you will find that Hill's prose is far from unreadable.  By and large, I continue to find Hill's style to be readily approachable after 3 decades worth of repeated readings.  In any case, the prose is not what makes this work invaluable.  Like another reviewer stated, you cannot do any study of Stradivari instruments without first consulting Hill, and Hill remains the foundation of all scholarly work concerning Stradivari, even a century later.  While not exactly for laymen, nonetheless this book is relatively accessible to those who have only a passing knowledge in stringed instruments.  For those more expert, Hill remains the essential starting point.  If you have a young violinist in your family, I would recommend this book as a gift.  I still have my decades-old book, received one Christmas long long ago, and I am glad that I got it 
 Perfect for anytime.  Super comfortable.  You don't even know you're wearing sandals and the price is right!!!! 
 As a teacher of the Alexander Technique, I've read many basic and more esoteric books on the subject. This is one of the clearest and most useful I've read with the addition of emphasis on the voice.  The book is fun to hold -- the colors and layout invite one in. The diagrams, explanations and explorations are unusually direct and clear. It's a unique resource for vocalists. Even though I'm not a singer, I have begun to use this book both personally and professionally, since I use my speaking voice as do others. 
 Yes, for me, that book represents your country. It's a picture of it. For me, living from the outside, I see clearly the opposite sides, the paradoxal way of living in USA. It's a wonderful book telling the truth about convictions, souls and ways of living. It's a picture of New England. And it's a North book. I like it. By creating those personnalities, it's also drawing the political paradox of your country.   It's very, very sad reading the French version( I'm French Canadian). A lot, a lot of mistakes. For such a good book, it's something bad because it gives a shadow.   But for you, having the chance to read the English book, dont hesitate. It's a very, very good picture of "United" States of America 
 One of the more interesting video game ideas that I've seen in a long time. The Japanimation style is very cool and the gameplay is very engrossing. Using the stylus pen to perform medical procedures is shockingly addictive and frequently very challenging 
 This book has been loved by all of my children, every one of my children old enough to talk have this book memorized 
 It's a good story- it keeps the pace moving, and inserts nice little scenes of humor.  And the best part? It's so close to the actual book. 
 Hot loved it from the time I bought it til present no song is garbage.  If u love hiphop you'll love this Buy It!!!!!! 
 Unfortunately no stranger to intense grief, I marveled at the author's capacity to touch my spirit.  In the midst of Sophie's pain, I was often chuckling with the author's perspective, biting my lip with consternation, or cheering for small victories.  (Lolly Winston crawls inside your skin and won't come out until the book is complete.... yet leaves a haunting voice. 
  This is one of the volumes which comprise a series published by John Wiley & Sons. It was edited by George S. Day and Paul J.H. Schoemaker with Robert E. Gunther. (Day and Schoemaker are co-authors of the recently published  Peripheral Vision, published by Harvard Business School Press.) In the first two chapters which serve as an introduction, they suggest that a "different game" with different rules is now being played, and suggest how to avoid the various "pitfalls" of merging technologies. The material which then follows is carefully organized within Four Parts.  "Assessing Technologies": Day and Schoemaker explore technologies' various paths of development, recommend frameworks for evaluating them, and suggest what the role of government should be during the emergence of both technologies and industries.  "Managing Markets": They examine why emerging markets (so different from mature technology markets) require new approaches to research and assessment.  "Making Strategy": They explore the various demands of strategy formulation in emerging technology firms which include the need to combine discipline and imagination, the use of scenario planning, and strategies for dividing the joint gains.  "Investing for the Future": In this final Part, Day and Schoemaker offer insights on using real options to help assess the value and potential of emerging technologies for projects in which NPV may be negative.  For whom will this brilliant book be most valuable? I suggest two different groups of decision-makers. First, those in organizations which have begun - or are about to begin - development of technologies which they hope can achieve and then sustain a competitive advantage and require expect guidance on how to manage those technologies effectively. Also, those in organizations which need expert advice when confronted technologies (developedelsewhere) which will create disruption of a given competitive marketplace and thus pose a serious threat.  For executives in both groups, there really is a "different game to be played," one which has different rules. Winning or losing that game may well depend on understanding the issues and concepts which Day and Schoemaker explain with both rigor and eloquence in this book.  Those who share my high regard for it are urged to check out Day and Schoemaker's aforementioned Peripheral Vision as well Eric Drexler's Engines of Creation, Geoffrey Moore's Dealing with Darwin, Kellogg on Innovation & Technology co-edited by Ranjay Gulati, Mohanbir Sawhney, and Anthony Paoni, The Future of Technology edited by Tom Standage, Thomas S. Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and Joel Mokyr`s The Lever of Riches 
 Possibly one of the best dance singles of the 80's was Buffalo Stance. Put with the other selections like Manchild provides some listening you will never get tired of. Future selections just dont match the raw edge of this  CD. Neneh was and still is miles ahead of her time 
 this is like the classic that killed other classics. for some reason this is around the time when characters started dying off more in anime. so anime was never the same around this time. based off the manga loosely. i mean some parts are changed or edited. over here the manga was rare so try it if you like this type of animation. still one of my favorites in terms of anime classics. beware this is a type of movie that will kick you in your face and start to laugh. a very hyper violent film. lot's of action! 
 In this riotously funny satiric novel, Carl Hiassen again lambasts those who would dare spoil what remains of Florida's natural wonders.  Greedy real estate developers, unscrupulous lobbyists and corrupt politicians are all skewered with Hiaasen's patented brand of uncompromising cynicism.  Twilly Spree, the environmentally conscious protagonist, serves as Hiaasen's alter ego.  He's young, rich, impulsive and, let's face it, an ecoterrorist.  Also playing a key role is the recurring character known as Skink, the ex-Governor now living under the radar as an eccentric hermit.  Hiaasen deftly adds some very nice touches to enhance the appeal of Sick Puppy.  Among my favorites is the creepy and sadistic hitman appropriately named Mr. Gash.  Also adding to the fun are the side splitting descriptions of staged big game hunts.  A subject so laughable on its face one would think it immune to satirization.  Yet Hiaasen manages to accomplish just that in inimitable style.   Sick Puppy delivers plenty of the kind of laughs Hiaasen fans look for.  Recommended to readers who appreciate humor that is audacious, outrageous, cynical and, yes, a little sick 
 This is truly a good system. Iv'e sat on it, dropped it, kicked it, thrashed it, and it still is working fine. I did consider buying the psp at first but then i thought, I have an ipod nano, a dvd player, and a laptop. I didn;'t see the point for having 2 of the above. Also, honsetly, who would want to go on the web with a slow psp. CAn you imagine how hard it is to type!! Anyway, the games i recommend for the nds is mario kart ds, animal crossing, megaman battle network five, and for people that are reall hard core gamers, spiderman. (this is an extrmeley har game trust me)  Also, i do find picto chat quite usless. 33ft range isn't enough. Also, i was reading the psp reviews and about 85 percent of them said that the psp is for more mature gamers. What got me is that alot of kid reviews were saying that. All these kids playing M rated games is sorta scary, but that's just my opion.       Also if you have the "fat" ds, dont buy a ds lite. Thres no need unless your eyesight is bad. All it has is a brighter screen and a sleeker design. So it's not werth it. Once again this is only my opion, im just giving my advice.      The wifi feature is pretty cool. I am aware that psp has this too by the way. Anyway, mario kart ds does a great job usuing wi-fi. The feeling of sitting in your room playing with people across the world on this handheld is quite an extroindary feeling.      Well, all in all, if you really need a gaming device with good grapghics and multi media features get the psp. But im warning you it is very very fragile.      If you have a music device and a computer and just want a good gaming system with great games and is very durable, get nds.    They are both good systems just think about what you need in a system, Do you want a gaming device, or a multimedia device. Its your choice in the end. I hope this review has helped, I just want to make your shopping a tad bit easiers.        Cheers, Hisham Amery       
 Last year, I visited the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library & Musuem in Springfield, Illinois. At the Musuem, they had a temporary exhibit called "Blood on the Moon". It was a fascinatating exhibit and when I saw that the exhibit's name was taken from a book, I started looking for the book to go slightly more in-depth about the assassination. The book is pretty good. The beginning is good and I liked all the photos that were included in the book. But there are two reasons why I couldn't give this book 5 stars: there were parts that I had a hard time keeping myself interested in. A slight bit of dry reading. The second reason is the author's repeated repeatings of somethings in the book.  I'm not quite sure if the author forgot that he had already mentioned those facts or perhaps is underestimating the readers intelligence in remembering what they've read but I was annoyed that some things that I had already read kept popping up. I prefered the parts of the book when the author wasn't just reeling off facts and put things into action. The story of the assassination was fascinating and I liked how the author included maps of all the various Booth getaways. I also found the information about Lincoln's final trip back to Springfield very interesting.   So I wouldn't say this would be a book for anyone who is more interesting in maybe the story-telling aspect of this part of history since the telling of fact upon fact might bore some people slightly. But I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning about the Lincoln assassination and especially anyone who was lucky enough to see the Blood on the Moon exhibit at the Abraham Lincoln Musuem 
 My Brother saw the movie before I did and told me all of its flaws: unrealistic action sequences, implausible escapes and a predictable script.  After hearing this and then watching it for myself, I found that I was actually entertained and satisfied with this film.  Ordinarily I would have written it off as another hip-hop movie lookin' to cash in on that demographic.  Meagan Good portrays her character well.  Usually I would dislike this type of character but she didn't make Coco a stereotype, which I applaud her for.  Tyrese, whom is many times typecasted as a reformed criminal (because big, dark blackmen make for a realistic portrayal of being a criminal in the eyes of many) makes 02 a likable hero.  He's been put through hell but still pulls through for his son and the damsel in distress.  Works for me.  And since this is urban fantasy, what's so wrong with a happy ending?  We black folk go through life with a modicum of happiness.  Why can't we have some happiness in our entertainment?  What's with this movies have to be realistic nonsense?  If I want reality, all I have to do is get up, go out and deal with the world.  If you can't get happiness for real why not put it in a movie.  Black couple do crime to save the life of a child: In real life, they're shot dead or locked-up.  In ghetto fantasy, they get away and start a new life in mexico.  It just puts an enormous cheese-eatin' grin across my face 
 This collection of "Little House and the Prarie" episodes from the first season has brought back many happy childhood memories for me.   Its like stepping back to a  time when old fashioned values were appreciated.  I am thrilled to be able to share this quality enterainment with my young children.  Every episode teaches a lesson in kindness, love and understanding.  The locations are so beautiful and and life so simple then.  My four year old loves it now, especially the episodes where Nelly Olsen gets whats coming to her!  If you're worried about  modern televisions negative influence in your childs behavior take control, go out and buy this.  You will be very glad you di 
 My grandfather taught me never to trust a man who wears a bow-tie, but I have to give George Will credit for his deep knowledge of the sport (which never bogs down into pedantry) and - a far rarer commodity in baseball writing - his sterling prose. You don't have to agree with his sour political conservatism (which, in an impressive display of self-knowledge, he attributes to being a Cubs fan) to find this a cracking good read 
 Antiques and an antique show and a cast of shady characters ... what could be more entertaining?  Really enjoyed this one ...looking forward to the next in the series 
 This book gives you an idea of how incestuous the Surrealist movement was. It gives an insight into what went on in the artistic circles of the era. It is thoughtful and extraordinarily interesting. The various authors and their different viewpoints help to show the complexity of the movement and the artists without being too much in awe of artists like Man Ray or Hans Bellmer. It is also a beautiful book with a pretty pink and gold embossed cover (under the dust jacket). Full of stunning reproductions and personal photographs. Excellent read and aesthically pleasing 
 This is one of the best collection of vampire stories i've ever read. This book combines traditional vampire tales with those having more psychological or sci-fi elements. I especially recommand reading Shambleau by C.L.Moore, The Girl w/ the Hungry Eyes - F. Leiber, Bite-Me-Not - T. Lee and Unicorn Tapestry -S. M. Charnes. However, all the stories defenetly deserve to be read 
 I'm a quilter, not a knitter, but I have experienced the calming nature of working with my hands.  I also went through chemo with Susan, and was a member of the support group she talks about in this book.  She writes so eloquently, and with such humor, about her life.  Everyone I have given this book to has loved it, but it has a special place for me 
 In the book The Great Fire the author gives you a lot of amazing facts, pictures, and he lets you see what is going through four main character's eyes.  One of the amazing facts this book gives you is that the people who told the fire engines what place to go, miscalculated it three times, and sent the fire engines in wrong directions.  One of the great pictures they give you is a lady on postcard posing as Catherine O'Leary milking the cow that started the fire.  This book is a great book for young readers like me.  I give The Great Fire by Jim Murphy two thumbs up 
 This version of Annie is a great introduction for the younger set and showcases some terrific Broadway talent, but leaves out a lot from the original stage version. As others have mentioned, the politics, romance between Grace and Warbucks, and villianous behavior of Miss Hannigan that were such a winning combo on stage have been toned way down by Disney. Alicia Morton is adorable and has a beautiful voice, but trades in a lot of Annie's signature pluck for sweetness. Some of the song lyrics have been changed, while other songs have been cut completely. The purist might find all of this this detrimental, but my 3 year old does not know the difference and just enjoys the heck out of the story, the singing, and the dancing. And the length of the film is perfect for her attention span. Miss Hannigan appears to have kicked her drinking problem in this version, which robs both the actress and the viewers of some great comedic material, but leaves parents of young children with less explaining to do.  While this version of Annie is a bit of a "Lite" approach, it is in my opinion an improvement over the overdone 1992 version. Editing a few things out is to me less of a crime of creative liberty than adding a character (Poonjab) and songs that were not part of the stage version.  So far there is no movie version that is a worthy substitute for seeing Annie live on stage in its entirety, but this movie covers the basic storyline and memorable songs, and is great for young Annie-lovers 
 Social Stratification In Sociological Perspective is a college-level treatise on social issues affecting class, race and gender appears in its second edition to discuss the evolving field of stratification. College students will find a survey of stratification research, with articles in different sections examining the field and its broader issues and controversies. This comprehensive reader may well serve as a classroom text on the topic for sociology courses 
 it is the beat keyboard i have ever youd. i am a BIG GAMER. I LOVE IT.  JJ JUSTEN 
 Just got this Suspense pack, good collection of films. Many well known actors, and movies from the 70's and 80's. Transfers look better too, not so murky like other 50 packs I have Chilling and Horror packs.  Just watched "The Swap", intense movie,Robert DeNiro has a brief part, (taken from an earlier film and spliced in)but it had to be made in 79 not 69 like it says, they drive a 79 Mustang!  Night of the Sharks has Treat Williams and Antonio Vargas.  Julie Darling, good suspense here, snakes,guns,hot sex,jealous daughter and Nestles Quick, 3 scoops not 2!!!  The Seducers/aka Death Game; wow crazed psycho women ! Sondra Locke! females nude, torture,mayhem, a guys worse nightmare! watch out for SPCA vans!!!  The Woman Hunter, about a woman who thinks she is being stalked, (Barbara Eden) but finds out at the end with a twist what really is going on!  Escape from Sobibor, a nazi prisoner camp that the prisoners decide to try to escape from, very powerful movie.  Born To Win, interesting movie that takes place in NYC early 70's, about a guy who just wants to get ahead of others in the drug culture scene with better dope. It stars George Segal with smaller roles by Karen Black,Robert Deniro and  Hector Elizondo, not like the listing on the box George Segal is the bigger star here not DeNiro.  A Killing Affair, wow this one is good right to the end. Intense movie about a drifter who knows too much and has plenty of stories to tell. Peter Weller (Robocop) is the drifter and John Glover (Lionel Luthor on Smallville) is the town preacher. Set in the 40's in West Virginia. Music by John Barry (007 music). Watch out for the wild dogs!  The Manipulator:  strange pop star/stunt man (think 70's dinner music) who is set up with too many conspiracies to confuse him about the producer's daughter, who he wants to marry,and the mob(?) to get him out of the way(?) and takes place in South Africa. Mickey Rooney is not in this movie as listed unless I didn't catch it right, must be a wrong Titled Film, this has Stephen Boyd and Rex Maynard in it.    A Tattered Web:  this is a good one with Lloyd Bridges as a good cop gone bad. He worries too much about Tina, his daughter, which causes all sorts of problems for him.  Crime Boss, a good one about taking over the mob, with Antonio Sabato Sr. and then half way thru Telly Savalas takes over the movie. Good story and everytime Telly Savalas is in a movie he steals the show with his characters, just so good to watch.   Very good movie selection in this 50 pack. 
 Set at the fictional equivalent of Duke University (or Stanford or Michigan, per the notes above), Wolfe's latest novel tells the story of a brilliant freshman from rural North Carolina trying to deal with the alien world of a big-time (academically, athletically, socially, sexually and economically) university.  "Hide your daughters!" seems to be the primary message.  Wolfe works hard to get the college lingo and lifestyle right.  Carried by Wolfe's style, I breezed through this one quickly, but all I could think along the way was "Hide your (my) daughter!"  I'll leave it to the reader to find out what happens to Charlotte. 
 IT'S ALWAYS WITH GREAT PLEASURE TO WATCH A FILM WITH DEAN MARTIN AND THIS DOUBLE FEATURE IS A DOUBLE PLEASURE.DON'T MISS 
 Holy Smokes, Shannon Curfman rocks solid in this debut CD.  I just took a flyer on this CD based on the coveted & mystical Amazon referral-recommendation system along with customer reviews. My favorite tracks are "Far and Few Between", "True Friends", and "I Don't Make Promises".  She holds her own with ground with her rendidion of extremely familiar "The Weight" by The Band which as been done by more than one heavyweight in the music world including one of my favorite Aretha Franklin. Curfman's vocal are strong, bluesy, and mature.   If that wasn't enough, her guitar work is great.  The accompanying session artists are top-shelf.    I am still playing tracks from this album regularly.    If you can pick up the CD for less than $10, it is an  "automatic buy" in my book.  If Shannon Curfman was scheduled to play in my area, I would find the time to go to the show.  
 As the founder and CEO of a successful market research-based consulting firm, I'm privy to the inner workings of a number of Fortune 500 companies. One of my perennial frustrations with books on business strategy is that the theories they present don't often correspond to the practical realities involved in running a large organization. The beauty of this book is that Vince Barabba's strategic guidance is informed by his first-hand experiences at General Motors. In drawing on his time at GM, Barabba makes compelling and insightful links between theory and practice.  As a business consultant, what I valued most was his 'systems thinking' approach to solving business problems--an approach that better ensures decision-makers identify and address core issues rather than merely tinker at the margins. This holistic approach to problem-solving goes beyond rote McKinsey-esque formulas and is what makes this book so broadly appealing. Using clear and forceful language (no annoying b-school patois here), Barabba gets right to the heart of things with a combination of robust theory and practical examples. Business decision-makers at every level would benefit from a close reading of this book.          
 Before movie blockbusters like Ben-Hur awed the film going audience with amazing chariot races in '59, or 'The Ten Commandments' miraculously parted the Red Sea in '56, the 'The Robe' won over the Christian audience in '53 with a poignant though fictitious appendium to the story of Jesus of Nazareth. It may not have been quite as grand in scale  as the two epics to follow, but it was every bit as attractive and compelling.  Plot: Marcellus Gallio (Richard Burton), a Roman tribune from a weathy and prominent Roman family is sent to serve in far away Jerusalem after an altercation with Caligula (Jay Robinson), the future emperor. While in the Holy Land Marcellus' last official act before returning home is to oversea the crucifixion of Jesus. While Jesus slowly dies on the cross Marcellus plays a game of dice with the soldiers, wining the robe of the would be Messiah in the process. Moments later Jesus dies, the sky darkens, thunder strikes and a downpour begins.   Marcellus' slave Demetrius (Victor Mature) leaves the tribune, taking the robe with him to return to the Christian community and Marcellus returns to Rome a vastly different man. Emotional disturbed by the experience of Jesus' crucifixion he is on the verge of a complete mental breakdown. Is there power in the robe, maybe a curse placed on it by this man who called himself Messiah? For the sake of his sanity Marcellus returns to the site of his obsession to recover the robe and discern the source of its hold on him.  Comments: I love everything about this film. Burton and Mature are at their best, Burton's love interest Jean Simmons (Diana) has never looked lovelier and Jay Robinson in the role of Emperor Caligula gives one of the greatest supporting performances that has ever graced the movie screen 
 these undies keep my balls warm in the winter and cool in the summer and that is important 
 Everyone knows the expression, "Ponzi Scheme", but I doubt many knew the derivation.  Mr. Zuckoff lays out its derivation in this terrifically readable book.  The real Mr. Ponzi immigrated from Italy, moved around, being arrested in Montreal and Mississppi, before settling down in Boston where he started a "Rob Peter to pay Paul" scheme which now uses his name.  Ponzi offered 50% return on investment in a mere 45 days in 1920.  Mr. Zuckoff points out how the American psyche was so ripe at the time for such get rich schemes.  Ponzi took advantage of that mindset and in a brief period - just a matter of months - compiled a fortune.  It is truly unclear from the letters, quotes and litany of acts by Ponzi whether he ever believed he could repay all his investors or was knowingly just trying stay ahead - one step before the law and one step in front of running out of money to pay investors.  Certainly he could have fled back to Italy at any time before getting caught, but he never did.  Until the authorities caught up with him he was able to continue paying his high ball interest.  Mr. Zuckoff's portrayal of the con artist shows him to be so charismatic and colorful that the reader gets swept up into him just as his many Boston supporters did during the Ponzi-mania.  You almost have to root for the little guy.  Mr. Zuckoff also portrays the antagonists - whoops - the journalists and authorities that catch up to Ponzi very well.  The editor of the Boston Post is another rags to riches hero of the book.  Although this is, for the most part, the history of Ponzi and scheme, the author paints a complete picture of the times in which he was able to perpetrate his scheme/crime.  This is what makes this book a more comprehensive history than just the telling of the scheme and how it was uncovered.    To make the book even more entertaining, it is written almost like a novel, with each page revealing a bit more of the story.  This very readable book is highly recommended.   
 I enjoyed this book but i think "Shes Come Undone" was a much better read, another of Wallys novels.  It could be the characters were male and i related better to the female character in "Shes Come Undone".  Id say it was ok.   
 Unlike some former reviewers, I think this book was really exciting and interesting. I loved the druid idea. I think others who didn't like it just didn't get the point. There is more to Buffy than just kicking vampires' you-knows, and this has it. Buy this book, it's worth it 
 As a huge Tightwad Gazette fan, I'm so glad that Steve and Annette Economides have taken up the frugal torch so to speak.  Yes, I agree this book contains less information, mainly due to its size, than the TG volumes but the ideas therein are still very helpful.  I learned a lot of new ways I can save money yet provide for my family very well.  The Economideses also have a newsletter that you can subscribe to (via their website) that contains more tips, ideas (theirs and other readers), recipes, etc.  I hope these lovely people keep on writing as I think they have a wonderful message to share.  I gave this book four stars as I would have liked them to include recipes in the chapter on Groceries.  The chapter on Attitude is excellent and in my opinion, worth the cost of the book alone. 
 Without a firm line on Thomas Merton, one may initially wonder why his autobiographical tale possesses more merit than anyone elses.  He, like countless others, led a life of profligacy consumed by the demands of self-gratification.  He like countless others, afforded the material world far more of himself than it deserved.  And, he, like *all* others, did not innately recognize the roots of true happiness.  So, how is Thomas Merton different?    Well, for starters, he did something about it.  How many times have men and women stopped to wonder whether the quest for material gain is all that a life can offer?  And how many times have men and women acknowledged the gnawing pit in their stomach with the suspicion that it can't possibly be?  More importantly, however, who among us has been courageous enough to do something about it?  Merton's journey from profligate young man to a member of the Trappist order cannot be everyone's response to temporal challenge, but it was a natural transition for him and one by which we all can profit.   The Seven Storey Mountain is only part autobiography for it is well-supported by spiritual pillars.  It is the story of one man's trek to God, but certainly not of one man's temptations.  We all face the paradox.  We can strive for material gain, we can bend to self-gratification, but in the end we find that the results of such efforts fall short of true contentment.  Merton's personal solution speaks volumes to the typical suburban striver and, though it may not vault one towards the monastery, gives the reflective reader reason to pause.  It, perhaps, illuminates the daily routine of material gain for what it is:  gain for gain's sake.  And it may inform us that there is more to this life than first meets the eye.  At the very least it should inform us to look for what is not readily evident, to look further down the road and, perhaps, to both sides.    The Seven Storey Mountain is a journey unto itself and the patient reader will reap it's rewards.  I am no mystical, New Age daydreamer, but I've learned that cold pragmatism will not suffice to furnish a life well-lived and well-loved. Thomas Merton addressed these issues with grace and humility; two virtues from which we all could benefit more.  5 stars.  
 The first book I read out of Thomas Hardy's many works was "Far from the Madding Crowd" back in my secondary school days. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. Reading "The Mayor of Casterbridge" only confirmed that my liking for Hardy's works was not misplaced. The Mayor of Casterbridge is absolutely brilliant as the author uses his perceptive insights into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalities. For example, Henchard is an alcoholic who suffers from many of the accompanying afflictions that include low self-esteem, shame, guilt, self-castigation, self-punishment, loneliness, a death wish, and a tendency to depression.  The book starts in the first chapter with a dramatic masterpiece that perfectly sets the tone and theme for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work. They go to a country fair where Henchard, an alcoholic, gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Once Henchard sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family. Abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life.  The story unravels nineteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, Henchard who was now the Mayor of Casterbridge falls from grace, this being a result of his own character flaws and the hand of fate.   I enjoy reading Hardy's impressive prose, which is strong, sharp and descriptive. The various scenes the author describes are filled with vivid and compelling imagery that leave one wanting to read more and more. Thomas Hardy is especially adept at describing the environment which he has a deep seated love for. The ironic twists of fate provide a setting that demonstrates the brilliant writer that Hardy is where he expertly weaves a plot that shows the themes of the balance between fate and individual choice. That makes The Mayor of Casterbridge very pleasant to read despite the sad story.  For those who wish to study English Literature, The Mayor of Casterbridge is on the top of the recommended list. The book provides exceptional descriptions of England and its culture as well as exposing the student to themes of profound gravity and importance. The book provides clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy. It is well-written, is easy-to-understand and to follow. 
 Each time I reread "How I Grew" I enjoy it more.  Mary McCarthy paints a picture of herself coming of age intellectually , alongside engaging and often hilarious descriptions of the people she meets in these formative years between age 13 and 21, the town she grows up in (Seattle), and her early experiences at Vassar.  What I love most is her chronicle of the most important and influential books and teachers in her life at this time, and how they shaped and sharpened her already apparent keen intelligence.  Witty, self-deprecating, acid-tongued, insightful, and admittedly selective in her memories, in this book Mary McCarthy gives us some clues as to how a young girl with a formidable intellect grew into one of America's literary giants 
 This book presents the latest version of ACT-R, which is at present the most elaborated and most widely applied formal model of human memory and complex cognitive performance.  Anderson's ACT-R theory is the sort of  theory Cognitive Science should aim at: comprehensive, compact and elegant.  This book not only describes the theory, but also shows it is successful in  many different domains of cognitive sience 
 A wonderful guide, as expected!  I live in the eastern US and use my Peterson guide to the birds of eastern North America almost daily -- it is, in my view, a perfect field guide to birds.  I bought this guide for use when traveling on the west coast.  I have two relatively minor complaints with the Field Guide to Western Birds.  First, unlike in the Field Guide to Eastern Birds, there are no thumbnail range maps next to the descriptions -- all the range maps are in the back of the book.  Second, nowhere in the descriptions are we told how common the species is (also unlike in the Field Guide to Eastern Birds).  This latter piece of information is helpful in the field -- in identifying birds, it's good to know how probable or improbable it is that you're seeing a particular species, both to help rule out unlikely birds and to gain appreciation of conservation issues.  Other than these pretty minor quibbles, I love this guide 
 I highly recommend this book to any coaches that want to take their game to the next level.  The one thing that this book does is break down every aspect of the game and gives you many, many ideas on how to implement the strategies explained.    I have been coaching baseball for 7 years at the high school level and have attended many baseball coaches clinics throughout the United States.  I have learned many things at these clinics.    The beauty of this book is that it something that you can continue to reference back to again and again.  This book has definitely aided to my players development.  From defensive strategies to times to use the run game, this game covers it all.  I have also loaned this book out to other coaches and they have enjoyed it also.    If you are looking to take your coaching to the next level, I highly recommend this book 
 This item was ordered as a gift for an older woman who really wanted to find this book again, and one visit to amazon.com and she was reunited with a book she loved.  She actually cried!!  She was so happy.  Thank you for such an easy transaction.  It took me only 5 minutes to find, order, pay and complete a wish for someone really special!!! 
 An excellent overview of the sutras (suttas in Pali) which gives more than an excellent introduction to the entire tipitaka of the Pali scriptures.  If you have time to read only one book on the Buddhist scriptures, this is the one 
 Loud. Sludgy but not plodding at all. A LOT of vocal harmony, in that style reminiscent of Alice in Chains, which is great. These riffs are killer. These songs bleed into one another, fusing together the whole album as one big piece.   At first, everything sounds the same. It's very layered. But the differences throughout the album actually pull it together - tempo, mostly, as well as mood.  Two sets of drums cause an overdose in the rythym department at times, and it's almost unfortunate that they weren't recorded better. For all the percussion, very little stereo mixing was used, and the recordings sound like they came from one atmospheric mic instead of a ton of carefully placed drum mics. At first, I didn't like this, but now I agree with the production choice. It just adds to the muddiness.  There's a fusion here. Songs lead into other songs, the album has moods. It gets faster and more angry and sort of confused, but takes breaks, not to calm down, but more to reflect. It ends up being tired at the end, it seems to have worn itself out for all the energy it started with.  If you can handle non-mainstream rock with wild production and an overall feel, totally listen to this album 
 By far the best and useable insect book I have seen. By haveing the very good colored pictures on one page and across the page the text,you didn't have to hunt all over to put them together.Very readable. 
 a nice reading for both the casual reader and the invert enthusiast; fantastic pics too 
 Explains New Age Magick in detail, and touches on the spiritual and mental aspects more than other books I've read.  Also deals with curbing prejudices and the "concrete mind".  An excellent book for a  person interested in Magick 
 this collar doesn't feel as rough as most--its soft and looks comfy. but it is totally durable. i have a jack russell & my little guy pulls & tugs and is pretty harsh on everything.  i would buy this again.  plus, it's super cute! 
 `Vegetables Every Day' is by Jack Bishop, a very intelligent craftsman of cookbooks similar to James Peterson, Molly Katzen, Rose Levy Beranbaum, and Pam Anderson. Each is skillful at creating very useful reference books on various aspects of cooking. And, it should be no surprise that both Bishop and Pam Anderson are current or past senior staffers at `Cooks Illustrated' magazine.  It is a great treat to have two of these skillful authors both do excellent books on vegetables, and to have the two books done from two so different points of view that one will feel no pangs of waste by owning both. Bishop's book is certainly the more accessible of the two, as the material is presented in a very straightforwardly encyclopedic presentation. There are uniform articles on 66 different vegetables, a veritable celebration of the variety of vegetables available through part or all of the year round. Among these 66, there are the old favorites such as broccoli, carrots, celery, mushrooms, potatoes, tomatoes, and onions. Alongside these there are new favorites brought to our attention by hours of watching Mario Batali, Bobby Flay, and Jaime Oliver such as Artichokes, Broccoli Rabe, Cardoons, Celery Root, Dandelion Greens, Fava Beans, Fennel, Soybeans, Turnips, and Zucchini. At the far end of familiarity are Boniato, Burdock, Calabaza, Chayote, Jerusalem Artichokes, Kohlrabi, Malanga, Sorrel, Taro, and Yuca. These are the veggies which should be approached with one of my favorite Alton Brown `Good Eats' moments when he recommends that you walk into your megamart with fresh eyes on the lookout for unfamiliar products and investigate what can be done with these little gems.  Bishop is not only intent on providing things to do with newly available produce, he is intent on making cooking all vegetables, especially the old standards with a new set of recipes to make them more interesting and to make cooking them more fun. One excellent case in point is asparagus that everyone either boils or steams and dresses with some creamy sauce. Since everyone already knows how to do this, Bishop doesn't bother to give recipes for these. Rather, his nine asparagus recipes include three roasting methods, a grilling recipe, two sautee recipes, a recipe with Chinese noodles, a recipe with a vinaigrette, and an asparagus frittata.  Every article, regardless of how many recipes may be given, has the same seven (7) paragraphs in the introductory article. The first paragraph simply introduces you to the vegetable and gives you a general idea of the appeal and usability of the vegetable. The next paragraph on availability gives the best season for the produce and whether or not the vegetable is currently available year round in American markets. The third paragraph on selection gives us criteria for whether we want to pick up today's selection of a species or let it alone. The paragraph on storage is especially useful, as there is probably very little wisdom handed down from your Eastern European grandma on storing tomatillos, taro, or jicama or from your Mexican mom on dealing with arugula, bok choy, or burdock. The basic preparation paragraph can be simple for leafy greens or very complicated for artichokes. The very short section on best cooking methods is primarily useful for totally unfamiliar vegetables. A very useful last entry gives recipes on other vegetables in which the titular ingredient appears.  One may not think there is anything controversial about vegetables, but you may be surprised, especially if you read Bishop's and Peterson's books side by side. On the matter of asparagus, Bishop prefers thin to medium thickness stalks and prefers not to peel them. Peterson prefers medium to thick stalks and strongly recommends peeling the stalks. To a certain extent, this is a matter of personal preference, but much of this difference comes from the fact that Peterson is a former restaurant chef / owner while there is no record in Bishop's biographical information that he ever worked in a restaurant kitchen. If time is less important than money, then Peterson's position is definitely the better. If time is at a premium, Bishop's position may be preferable. On almost all other issues, the two authors agree.  One corollary of Bishop's objective in preparing this book is that this is not a reference for the most commonly prepared recipes. But, this is not universally true. While the traditional steaming or poaching methods for asparagus is absent, classic mashed potatoes and the traditional Greek salad with tomatoes are here. Bishop is certainly on the side of the gourmet when it comes to discussing tomatoes. He is in love with fresh homegrown tomatoes in July and August, but recommends canned `maters all other times of the year.  One of the most enjoyable discoveries in Bishop's book is to find ways to treat certain vegetables in totally unexpected ways. Two cases are shallots and garlic. Both are most commonly thought of as herbs to enliven dishes where some other vegetable or protein is the main ingredient, but if you are willing to pay the price, shallots make a great main ingredient, not really much different in cost from, for example cippolini or wild mushrooms.  In choosing between Bishop and Peterson, I find that Bishop is much better for the average cook who does not spend a lot of time reading cookbooks. The organization is much better for finding a good recipe for the veg that happened to be on special today. Peterson's book is much more oriented toward the foodie and the professional. It is organized more by method than by ingredient and it is much better at presenting instructions on difficult techniques such as cleaning an artichoke. Peterson has the one thing I miss the most in Bishop's book, which are good pictures of vegetables. Neither comes with the lyrics of Frank Zappa's `Ask Any Vegetable'.  Very highly recommended as a vegetarian and general cook's reference for recipes and buying advice. 
 In this sprawling, captivating, most readable biography, Walter Isaacson has drawn a well-balanced, multi-layered portrait of Einstein.   It is quite possible that growing up slowly has its advantages. In his early childhood Einstein was a slow learner. He learned to speak only after the age of two. And because of his slow verbal development, "he thought that it allowed him to observe with wonder the everyday phenomena that others took for granted. Instead of puzzling over mysterious things, he puzzled over the commonplace," the author has written.  Walter Isaacson states that Einstein once explained how he happened to discover the theory of relativity: "The ordinary adult never bothers his head about the problems of space and time. These are things he has thought of as a child. But I developed so slowly that I began to wonder about space and time only when I was already grown up. Consequently, I probed more deeply into the problem than an ordinary child would have."  I was not surprised to read that even though his parents were irreligious, Einstein himself believed in God, a "God who reveals Himself in the harmony of all that exists".  Not all scientists are atheists, of course. He saw no contradiction between science and religion. "The religious inclination lies in the dim consciousness that dwells in humans that all nature, including the humans in it, is in no way an accidental game, but a work of lawfulness that there is a fundamental cause of all existence," he has said.  When I hear the name Einstein, I think of the bust of Einstein I saw in a museum when I was six years old. The bust, sculpted of fine white marble and placed on a black marble pedestal, was given a prominent place in the museum hall. After reading Walter Isaacson's biography of Einstein, I felt as if the author had transformed the cold marble sculpture into a warm and beautiful statue of clay, and relocated it from its glistening pedestal to a pedestal of molded clay, fired to brick-red in a kiln. Now grainy and highly textured and stripped of its halo and made to look earthy and human, the formidable bust suddenly looks more inviting, approachable, and even likable.    With the aid of newly released personal letters and archival documents that were unavailable to biographers before, Isaacson has written a charming and impressive biography, as unexpected and startling as a previously unknown type of delicious and succulent fruit, almost like a pineapple that grows on a slightly prickly plant.    What better way to conclude this brief review than with the words of Einstein himself: "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind."  I must say that this book has won me over.    
 everybody loves humor, everybody loves food, and, well, there are creeps who don't like penn & teller, but this if one of the funniest things i've ever read, i learned every trick in the book and life is neeeeeever  boring. the two best parts, in my opinion: teller's bit on the great egg  drop and penn's story of a milkshake as self-defense. worth every penny 
 Like my friends, I just love the pulsating power of this record. I also appreciate the way Dylan gets his spiritual message across without jamming it down your throat. "Jokerman" for me is reminiscent of "Subterranean Homesick Blues" and I can just picture a younger Dylan with those signs tossing them away during the singing of "Jokerman" the way he did in "Don't Look Back." I'm not a very spiritual person, but the biblical references in "Jokerman" did have me going to my Bible (everybody has one, religious or not, right?) and checking them out. Then there is "Sweetheart Like You," a song covered so well by Rod Stewart, but even more sentimental when you hear it sung by the writer himself. This is just a super rock and roll record, every song a gem 
 This book finds her at ease and at peace with her past.  intriguing.   She is very candid here.  Admitting to numerous mistakes, her faults and endless regrets.(even mentioning some episodes of temporary lunacy)and drug problems.  Almost like reading one's personal diary  It's also very comical at times. It is great in that nothing is too taboo to be included in these writings.     I read the original when it came out more than a decade ago. I must have been impressed as I remember it very well.  It's too bad my copy didn't have that lovely picture on the cover.  
 My best-friend loaned me her tattered copy of this novel and insisted that I read it.  I have a passion for all things ancient and Asian, so naturally this novel picqued my interest.  In a nutshell, this book completely enraptured me.  It has EVERYTHING one could want in a book -- romance, comedy, terror, mystery and unique, memorable, lovable characters.  Hughart is a master of imagery and story-telling, interwining fables and history with an incredible fantasy that's completely his own.    Bridge of Birds deserves be counted among the greatest novels ever written 
 I have 1 cat and I have found that the immediate odor control is better for eliminating odors than the long lasting odor control (which says it is designed for multiple cats)  This is a great litter for the price and I have tried a lot of them.  Great clumping, great odor control, and most stores carry it in my area 
 "A commendable initiative from a visionary who has consolidated global knowledge into a composite brevier not only for C-Level decision makers but also trendsetters and entrepreneurs in the knowledge industry."                               Dr Jannie Tay                              Vice Chairman                              The Hour Glass Limited, Singapore     
 I am a classical music collector finding myself being intrigued with the invention of ways to bring classical music to today's audiences.  Karl Jenkins is a thoroughly trained classical composer with an ear toward tomorrow.  With his tasteful use of electronic overdubs,and his wonderful, sensitive knowledge of early and modern music, he has put together a marvelous stepping stone from Khachaturian into the world of Enya and ethnic genres.  It's a wonderful discovery.  Try it! You'll LOVE it 
 I found this book very inlightning it has improved my system over 50%, it is accurate and safe with all the information it gives the reader, I would recommend it to any one who is serious about healing their body, mind and spirit 
 Shirley Corriher's book Cookwise: The Secrets of Cooking Revealed is truly a cookbook (instead of a recipe book) and is one of very few classiccook books which will never go out of style.  Corriher's writing is very readable - unlike recipe books which simply list the ingredients and pretty picture - and is compelling reading because she explains how and why even the simplest recipe can go wrong, and how to make sure that it goes correctly the next time.  The author does this by reducing core ingedients to their chemical make up in plain English, and the explaining how ingredient react with each other and under certain circumstances.  Had Corriher been your chemistry teacher in high school, there would be a most chemists in the world today.  Corriher does provide recipes - but these are presented not only as expiriments, but as step by step examples of how her chemistry lessons do come to life.  I was an OK baker before I read this book - but since reading it, and using it as a reference source before each project, I have become an incredible baker.  How so?  For example, Corrihers explaination of how gluten is formed has made me a master of scratch cake textures - the proper texture for the correct type of cake makes all the difference in the world.   If you want a recipe book full of studio photogrpahed foods, or one that will help you become the type of cook that can make those same delights without fuss and on a consistent basis, this is most definatly the book for you 
 Don't be fooled by the Rockabilly in the title because even fans of rock 'n roll might think it's just early country rock but this collection is so much more. Obscure. Sure, but there are no bad tracks on this collection - they're all cool, fun and definitely rock 'n roll. There are a couple where the sound quality can generously be described as recorded next door but if you're a fan of obscure rock 'n roll or you're making your Christmas CD and want to sprinkle in a few tracks no one else has ... this is great. In this collection, you get some rockabilly but mainly just a lot of great early rock from rhythm & bluesy rock to precursor garage rock to early surf guitar to as mentioned by the other reviewer - novelty songs but these are no "chipmunks-songs," they are all rock 'n roll. If you like your rock n' roll a little garage, a little rough around the edges but all done with passion and a great driving beat - you will want this CD 
 A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain is a wonderful study of the life of Vietnamese people after the fall of South Vietnam.  Many of the stories in this collection take place in the United States, especially in Louisiana.  What captivates the reader in these stories is the fact that, while placing these stories within the Vietnamese community, Butler is able to discuss universal themes of jealousy, discrimination, alienation, and many others.  The stories are in easily accessible prose and have meanings that challenge our self-understandings.  On another level, Butler allows the reader a glimpse into the Vietnamese worldview - one that is very different from the American way of looking at life.  This book is well worth picking up and savoring 
 Faith and Fire is the first book outside of the Games Workshop Codex supplemental books to truly showcase the all-female military arm of the Imperium and its dogmatic Ecclesiarchy. Those who have followed and played the Warhammer 40,000 games from Games Workshop would know right away the subjects of James Swallow's third Warhammer 40,000-based novel. For the uninitiated the book easily introduces the Adepta Sororitas role in the war-torn galaxy of the Imperium.   Swallow does a better job of following the basic guidelines, rules and history created by the makers of the game than in his two previous GW books. Loosely-based on the legendary Amazon's of Earth's past, the Adepta Sororitas are seen as faithful, loyal and zealot followers of the Imperium's God-Emperor. Swallow describes them as both being beautiful as angels and true warrior-nuns. Warriors whose dedication to their God-Emperor, and the church tasked in leading the Imperium in his worship, is unquestioned if not blindly at times. The main character of Sister Superior Miriya owes alot to past 40,000 novel characters like Uriel Ventris of the Ultramarines, Brother-Captain Alaric of the Grey Knights, and Colonel-Commissar Gaunt in that she's not just a blind follower of her religion's dogma but intelligent enough to question the world around her when things don't seem right.  Sister Superior Miriya is given the task of escorting  captured psyker-criminal Torris Vaun back to his home planet of Neva where it's Lord Bishop LaHayn of the Ecclesiarchy will dispense justice to the rogue personally. It is a task easier said than done. From the beginning the task doesn't sit well with Miriya and the Celestians under her command. The assignment goes against the very nature and role of her Sisterhood, but an order is an order and the situation soon spirals out of Miriya's control. Soon, Miriya is disgraced by her failure in her mission but given another chance to redeem herself, her unit and those who lost their lives during the mission. She's joined by Sister Hospitaller Verity (non-combatant medical-nun of a lesser order of Sororitas tasked with healing) whose blood-sister was one of the Celestians in Miriya's command who was killed during the mission.  The story moves at the brisk pace and gradually gives insight to the workings of not just the Adepta Sororitas, but also to the Ecclesiarchy they are bound to by ancient oaths and to the mythical and mysterious past of the Imperium's early days and the works of its immortal God-Emperor. Miriya and Verity are soon plunged headlong into political intrigue anethema to the Sisters of Battle, but their unshakeable faith will have to protect them from a secret kept by both allies and foes. The secrets and how Swallow gradually gives out tidbits throughout the book made me want to read faster and finish the novel to its conclusion. Those who hoavee been following the slow release of information concerning the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy histories of 40,000 will enjoy the info given by James Swallow.  Faith and Fire is a very good start to a new Games Workshop novel series.The character of Battle Sister Miriya and Hospitaller Verity are well-written and come off the pages with their own distinct personalities. I can't wait for the next book in the series and highly recommend this first book to fans of other Warhammer 40,000 novels 
 It is a totally inspiring and fun story.  While they have almost everything, two actors get to the hardest road for the challenge and maybe find some more about themselves.  It is great to watch their love for life and adventure.  Pushes you to get on your bike and do the same thing, or something similar but easier : 
 I'm not into surfaces and have only used a small part of this book for one purpose: for an introduction to self affine scaling. The topic is presented very systematically, with nice examples. Especially nice is the binomial model of multiaffine scaling. Multiaffine scaling is supposed to appear in "soft" fluid turbulence and is often mislabeled multifractal scaling, which is a horse of a different color altogether 
 Quite an amazing book. I picked it up after seeing it on a book list of top influential books in Prague. I guess it is popular in its original Czech language. The main character being a Canadian from the then  communist, totalitarian regime - was quite an experience for myself, and  gave me some insight on how the other half lived ... the fact was like a  fairy tale, and the fiction was such truth 
 this was my first ludlum book and it certainly will not be my last.dont read any negative reviews of this book.action packed...fast ...racing couldn't ask for more.trust me.it is a very good book about the world war 2 
 This is for the naysayer's who wrote reviews on "The Secret".   Larry King Live ran two episodes last November in which a number of the people who appear on the movie "The Secret" were guests and spoke on the law of attraction. I was in the kitchen doing dishes and at first I thought " ...here are some folks peddling some book they wrote". As I kept listening though I became aware that it was far more than that so I sat down to listen to the rest of the show. What these people were saying made sense to me on many levels and I felt like the blinders had been lifted from my eyes. A few days later I decided to go ahead and purchase a copy of the movie (after having viewed it online at The Secret website I knew I wanted to purchase a copy and share it with my loved ones).  The greatest thing Rhonda Byrne has done with this movie - and for which I am so eternally grateful for- is that she opened a door for many to step through and begin to begin the process of understanding ( or remembering as the great teachers called Abraham who come to us via Ester and Jerry Hicks) the law of attraction.   I do believe the title of the movie aka The Secret is compelling and on target as in some way this information was known by some very powerful people in the past who did not want others to become aware of it. All one has to do is view the scene of the movie with the smoke stacks of the great factories during the industrial revolution and watch the higher ups walk around in their suits and fancy hats while they looked on as the workers labored like worker bees to get the work done. Out of greed people who knew the secret wanted to keep it a secret because they wanted all the power. I know because at an earlier time I used to be one of the worker bees. I  always assumed and/or thought the others were smarter, more beatuful, luckier etc than I and so their lives were more   appealing in my eyes than mine. About 15 years ago I had a flash of clarity where I saw these people just thought differently than I and so that was the difference between us. A seed had been planted.  Rhonda Byrnes has made this information accessible to many who otherwise would not walk through that door and we all should give her kudos for that. Watch the movie...I also bought the CD and listened to it in my car for about a month after which I felt like I was operating on a new higher level of awareness and happiness.   The best thing is that by watching the movie I was led to the teachings of Abraham via Ester and Jerry Hicks. Abrahams teachings have brought me so much gratitude, excitment and happiness in the short time I have been tuned into them and I eagerly look forward to going to one of the workshops in about a month from now. I should sent Rhonda Byrnes a dozen roses just that!!!!  Thanks Rhonda - you've done a great servic through your vision and love for all that is 
 This movie is an excellent satire of the 1992 Democratic Presidential Primaries. John Travolta and Emma Thompson nail (pardon the pun) Bill and Hillary Clinton with their performances as Jack and Susan Stanton, a governor from a small southern state and his overly ambitious wife. It's worth watching for Kathy Bates' perfomance alone. Bates deserved the Oscar (she was nominated.) Her comic/tragic performance is one of the best supporting performances captured on film. The character of Henry Burton is a little flat, but not because of Adrian Lester's lack of trying, he just isn't given much to work with. He is the only normal character in a sea of eccentrics, and thus isn't allowed to shine. The movie is faithful to the novel of the same name by noted political writer, Joe Klein. The rest of the supporting cast are equally great, especially Billy Bob Thornton as the James Carville-esque consultant. Larry Hagman also turns in a touching performance. This movie and the novel are musts for every political junkie 
 Super watch with great features.  Couldn't be happier with it 
 Everything was great about this from the product to the promptness which it was received. 
 Iggy Corso isn't a bad kid.  He's not that bright, and he often does and says things long before thinking through the consequences of his actions, but he isn't inherently bad.  Iggy is the product of his upbringing, which includes an alcoholic  father, a junkie mother, and life in the Projects.  His school file is crammed with notations regarding his run-ins with security, teachers, and the principal.  But this time, Iggy's been expelled from high school pending a hearing with the  Superintendent, and there's no one around for him to tell--no one around, in fact, to even care.  Iggy, though, has a plan.  He'll contribute to the world, will somehow make a difference in these few short days before  Christmas and his school hearing, and convince everyone--from his parents to Principal Olmos--that they were wrong about him.  The first part of Iggy's plan involves getting out of the Projects, so he goes to the only other place he knows, which is the dump where his friend Mo lives.  Mo was kicked out of college, where he was studying pre-law, for smoking pot, and now he lives in an apartment with a broken window and ratty furniture, alternately stoned and renouncing all material hings.  But Iggy needs Mo's help to get him back into school, so he follows him along when Mo decides to get a line of credit on some pot.  Iggy doesn't do drugs.  Everything thinks he does, because of his home life, but being born addicted to crack did more to  Iggy than just slow down his brain.  He's seen firsthand how it affects his family, especially his mother, who has been gone  for months now "visiting" someone.  He's seen Freddie, his father's dealer, break his father's fingers when his dad didn't  have the money to pay for his drugs.  So although Iggy doesn't do drugs, he goes along with Mo when he needs some pot--and realizes that his plan isn't going very well when Mo goes straight to Freddie.  When Mo gets his pot, along with some other "free samples" on a line of credit, Iggy realizes that getting back into school might be the least of his problems.  But now it's Mo's turn for a plan--he needs a couple grand to pay off Freddie, so he'll  go to his mother, who has more  money than she knows what to do with.  But that doesn't turn out exactly right, either, and soon Iggy is involved in yet  another scheme involving drugs, a dealer, and a friend.  For Iggy, who isn't a bad kid but also isn't Mother Teresa, there's  a fine line between contributing to the world and making something of yourself.  SAINT IGGY is a great, heartbreaking read.  From the beginning, you can't help but wish a better life for Iggy, all the while knowing, somehow, that things aren't going to end up the way you want them to.  Iggy is a boy who has somehow fallen through the cracks, and yet he manages to bring a sense of hope to every situation he finds himself in.  Ms. Going has done a wonderful job of bringing Iggy Corso to life, and you'll be forever grateful for the chance of getting to know him. 
 As a friend and non-JW, I've listened to Tracy's story for years, in utter disbelief.  It was good to see her story intermingled with 24 other stories of those with similar experiences.  Must be refreshing to realize you are not alone.  Glad to see there are resources available, starting with Tracy's book, if you find yourself "lost" along the JW way 
 Magic and Loss was another concept album from Lou Reed.  I wished he made more of them because he's quite good and making song cycle discs.  The story of this album is about the cycle of life and death,  magic and loss of life and how they intwine with each other.  Lou Reed lost to friends to cancer and his thoughts and expressions were put to music.  A lot of interesting ideas here (how radiation can cause cancer but it's used to treat it at the same time) that are executed very well.  A depressing album that has a small light at the end of the tunnel.  Just like life, in order for it to continue we have to accept loss along with the magic.  One hand washing the other.  Great stuff from Lou Reed. Check out New York,  Songs for Drella, Berlin and Blue Mask for other great concept albums from the New Yorck City Man himself, Lou Reed.  Highly recommended 
 In five years of Architectural Design, I am hard-pressed to find a book that has made such an impact on my thinking and overall awareness of architecture. This is truly a must-read for any architecture student, and is extremely interesting for those non-architects out there. I highly encourage the investment 
 My Aunt who was an elementary school teacher recommended this book to me for our two kids.  My boys love it! My 2 year old wants me to read it 4 times in a row..complete with funny voices.  Highly recommend! 
 I am now 26 years old but as a child, I had at least 4 of Ed Emberley's books and my mother would take my brother and I to the library to check out those we didn't have. I am an engineer but on my way to a degree in Product Design. My brother, while he got a degree in English, was a top student in his art classes. Both of us have used our love and talent for art as adults. The great thing about this book is that Ed gives you the basic pieces but encourages you to be creative and go beyond the book and make the drawings your own. Many other drawing books only show a specific technique or how to draw a certain object which is discouraging and makes people believe that art has to look a certain way. When the truth is, art is what you like and what you make it to be. I believe that creativity is crucial and to be encouraged in our youth. I spent hours and hours with Ed's books. They are great for car and plane trips. You couldn't get us to stop making our own worlds on paper! Shove the computers, handheld games, and game boxes aside and put this in front of your children instead. 
 I thought this book was very well written.  It's very detailed in it's explanation of the SSR energy matrix.  I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more on this Subjec 
 I was amazed when I saw the number, quality and value of the FREEBIES that were listed in the book.  As parents, we often think that the more an activity or item costs the better it is,  but, this is not true.  There are so many quality fun and educational items and activities for kids, it will be a long time before I pay substantial $$ again.  I can't wait to see the other books that Linda Bowman has written about Freebies for Seniors, Pets, and on the Internet 
 I just read a negative review of this book.  Yes the parenting method repeats itself...but has to.  Each book has different nuggets to apply and different situations.  Both Jim and Charles (Father and Son) contribute to this book...Jim and a friend came up with the method, Charles an inspired son took it a step further and got a huge education so he can do the same thing his father does.    In order to put this method in to use and EXCEL AS A PARENT you have to practice.  I have reread this book, I listen to the Love & Logic CDs over and over again.  This method WORKS!!  For parents who are desparate this is for you.  For parents who want well behaved children this is for you.  As a parent I will do whatever it takes to give my child the best opportunity possible in life, the Love & Logic series do just that.  Get the book it is well worth it 
 Secret Of The Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism Of Tibet by Reginald A. Ray (Professor of Buddhist Studies, Naropa University, Boulder, Colorado) is the second and final volume of "The World of Tantric Buddhism" series from Shambhala Publications. A straightforward presentation written in plain accessible terms for readers at all Buddhist studies and experience levels, Secret Of The Vajra World deftly explores the foundations of Vajrayana, the essence of Tantric Buddhist philosophies, and applications of Buddhist principles and insights to one's own personal life, bodhisattvas in the world, and a great deal more. Secret Of The Vajra Worlds is a very welcome, superbly presented, truly comprehensive introduction focusing upon a unique and profoundly important aspect of Buddhist spiritual practice 
 A good beginner book to give basic recipes and ideas for cooking on the campfire.  The book does what I imagine it set out to do, giving starting point for people doing outdoor cooking with younger children such as parents, scout leaders, or teachers 
 It has been rated with 5 stars for the following reasons: It is very easy to get familiarized with the idioms. The step-by-step approach is very convenient and it facilitates the learning process. With respect to the previous edition more friendly and pleasant to read.  A very well edited book.Although the content remains substantially the same, we find outstanding improvements. 
 Hemingway invented a terse style using King James biblical cadences with an awful lot of and's and very few commas in his rhythmic sentences.  Certainly no semicolons, God forbid.  The shorter the word, the better.  The more ordinary, the more often in common usage, the better--but sprinkled here and there we find a highbrow word thrown in as if for spice.  In The Old Man and the Sea, which is a short story posing as a novel, Hemingway offers an example of the Sisyphean heroic tale.  Each day for eternity Sisyphus rolls a heavy ball up a hill and at the end of each day the ball comes rolling down again.  Albert Camus famously said that one imagines that Sisyphus was happy.  The old man of Hemingway's story embodies the karma of the Sisyphean hero in that most days throughout his long life he has gone to the ocean to fish.  And each day he comes home, and then the next day he goes out again.  The forces he is up against, the sea itself, the leviathan monsters of the deep, the unpredictable weather, the seasons of dearth and plenty in unpredictable fashion--all of these things and more, including the wiles of women who are influenced by the moon, all of these things are like the ball and the force of gravity that Sisyphus labors against.  And for what?  And to what avail?  It is the struggle itself that is the glory and the purpose and the reason for being.  So saith Hemingway in the way he meticulously details the laborious struggle of man versus fish: of the old man, not as strong as he once was, not as full of the desire that once burned in his soul, not as keen in discernment or vision, yet still a man with a man's pride and a man's duty; and the primordial fish, the great marlin, powerful and beautiful, full of great dignity, smarting now, suffering now with a hook in its mouth.  Who will win?  Will the marlin break the line or will the crafty old man lead out just enough to keep him hooked, and then as the fish tires, slowly gain a little line, inch by inch?  Some great or seemingly great event may define a man's life.  Here it is the off chance of hooking an especially huge marlin, and with diminished strength, bring him in for all to see, that defines the old man's life.  It is good that it comes late when for most the highlight of life was long ago.  It is good that the effort nearly kills him, and it is especially good that there was much doubt about the outcome.  This is the heroic or machismo view of this celebrated novel.  Since this was first published in 1952 its reputation has waned, or not so much waned as become something seen from another direction.  Instead of the heroic old man and the gallant marlin we see a kind of anthropomorphic delusion in which a hook of steel and a large brain torture a huge, dim-witted creature to death.  Instead of an epic struggle we see one predator taking advantage of another.  Instead of heroism we see a kind of tedious Darwinian incident made into something akin to a Greek myth.  And so it is with Hemingway himself.  Now seen as incorrigibly sexist and as more of a stylist than a writer of substance, Hemingway is no longer revered in the English departments of our great universities.  Instead he is remembered for shooting defenseless animals in Africa and imagining that such activities made him a man.  Instead of being one of America's greatest writers, he is now recalled as a good short story writer whose stylish mannerisms eventually grate on our sensibilities.  From being a great artist he has fallen to being a minor one, from being a best selling writer, the literary lion of his time, Hemingway is now remember as the man who blew his brains out because, as he is quoted as saying (in anticipation of course), something like, "I could no longer make love good."  Too bad he lived before the age of Viagra.  Note the psychologically correct  use of the adjective "good" instead of the grammatically required but artificial adverb "well."  Hemingway, like Mark Twain, made a point of not being a slave to grammar.   Regardless of the rise and fall of his reputation and even regardless of the lack of political correctness of his writings, it is nonetheless the case that The Old Man and the Sea is a striking piece of work, sentimental to a fault, simplistic in philosophy and even shopworn in theme, yet still it is a book that must be read if only to add to our understanding of the progression of popular American literature from James Fenimore Cooper to Mark Twain through James T. Farrell and John O'Hara to Larry McMurtry and Stephen King.  The Old Man and the Sea is in a sense a story best experienced young, which is one of the reasons it is on the high school curriculum.  It is striking and totally fulfilling the first time it is read.  Read it a second time and the mannerisms and the mock heroics begin to be discerned.  Read it a third time and it becomes tedious.  If read a fourth time the temptation is toward parody and burlesque 
 Next to Shakespeare I can not think of a Brittish poet who inspired me more than John Keats.  His lyrical phrases, his sense of music and metaphor, and his visionary splendor dazzles one and leaves a reader in awe of his gift.  My favorites are the Odes, especially the Ode To Psyche, and the Ode To A Nightingale.  One can only wonder what great works might have come into existence from this great literary genius had he lived beyond the age of twenty six.  Still, he did manage to distill from the heavens some of the finest poems of the English language 
 I am so pleased to be able to say that I loved this album!  I must admit, I was a little skeptical of an all-instrumental trance-chillout remix of Hanukkah classics.  This could easily have been a disaster.  Instead, it's the first entirely successful mainstream Hanukkah album geared toward 18-40 year-olds that I've ever heard.  This is the kind of music that I'd be proud to play at a holiday party, the kind of party where martinis outnumber hot chocolates.  Just as Craig Taubman and the Celebrate Series did with their album, Celebrate Hip Hop, this one goes where you didn't think Jewish music could go.  And I can only hope that they choose to go back again very soon.  Highly recommended 
 Stephen King is writing novels, and in this case short stories that are supposed to be read in the night to put yourself to sleep with a pair of nightmares as fodder of your soul. But here they are read, and it is different. Quite different indeed because the visual reading we are used to is replaced by hearing the reading of the tale by someone else. You become in other words inactive. And the reading by the actor simplifies the text and reduces it to one possible interpretation, whereas your own reading might open more doors. So you have to follow the reader. At times it even brings up readings you may not have thought of at all. For instance, the fourth tale,  That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is In French  read by Becky Ann Baker brings up that the dj vu feeling comes from the fact it is a second honeymoon and a second honeymoon has to be deja vu . Hence the hell or purgatory the text speaks of becomes that second honeymoon and not at all the hell or purgatory that might follow death. The tale becomes then very strong in the idea that you must never take second helpings, especially when the first one had been good. The second one can only be second grade. So try to listen to these tales and you will enjoy them as much as I did but in a quite different way you had enjoyed your own reading of them as printed on paper 
 Before reading Medjugorje the Message, I had been told of Medjugorje before and even saw one of the visionaries at a local church. Medjugorje did not touch me until reading this book! I was looking for something inspirational before having to start my second round of chemotherapy and this book seemed to just pop up out of no where. My second round of chemo happen to be the 24th anniversay of the apparitions, 06/24/05. I don't think any of this was a coincidence. This book definitely changed my life for the better! I have passed it on to family and friends and they feel the same way! Praise God 
 This movie has a little everything that will appeal to just about everyone.  There's plenty of comedy, lots of romance, a bit of action and suspense and a more or less happy, tear-jerker ending.  Not to mention the beauty of a young Demi Moore.  And as a plus, the paranormal aspect gets plausible treatment.  If you haven't seen this, I say you 'must'.  Go out and buy it to watch over and over.  
 I love this pump.. I am a first time mom and wanted to breastfeed, but I work 3 nights a week and would need to express milk for my baby.  I read all the reviews and wanted to try the ISIS since it isnt as pricey as the medela. I have had the best experience with this pump.  One thing to note is that to get a comfortable & good suction you have to get the cushion petal thing wet and leave it wet when you put it on the pump.. My baby is now 3 months old and still exclusively receiving breastmilk thanks to the ISIS 
 Really a good book. It was a page turner, it's got dramma, love, friendship, all that stuff that makes a good book. I recomend it if you want a relaxed read 
 We are certified massage therapists in the San Francisco Bay area. When clients ask us about lesser known or unfamiliar modalities, this is the book we reach for. It is concise, well-written, easy to understand from the  layman's point of view. It has even helped us in the enhancement of our own  practice by providing a guide to further studies and research to improve  our practice

 In this age of political correctness, it's refreshing to read another point of view. As she points out, of the first 31,000 rounded up on the west coast 16,000 were Japanese. Of those 16000 about 5632 immediately renounced their US citizenship and asked to be deported to Japan. How would you feel if FDR's govt left the Japanese dual citizens on Terminal Island, CA or Bainbridge Island, WA and one of the dual citizens sent word that a troop transport ship was leaving the harbor with 10,000 or 15,000 troops headed out to the Pacific past Japanese submarines. My guess is that some of the liberals evaluating this book would never have a chance to be  born! To believe otherwise would be to assume FDR was a bafoon or stupid 
 The best thing that I can tell about this book is that it makes you think. Of course, the different matters are simplified, but it is done in a smart way. The analogies to introduce concepts are very good, in the style of The Elegant Universe. This book is not conceived to explain Relativity, Quantum Physics or Superstrings; they are described just to introduce what spacetime could be according to our knowledge. Even if it is a best seller, I think it is a brilliant book. One important note is that I read this book before The Elegant Universe, and perhaps that is why I think that The Fabric of the Cosmos is even better than The Elegant Universe 
 I had not seen this movie in over thirty years, so I had forgotten just how good it was.  To start with, you have John Wayne in the lead. Then you have Dean Martin in one of his few serious roles.  Then comes Ricky Nelson, who could have been a great actor if he had been given a few more serious roles and not simply used as a cameo to bring in the teenage girls.  Angie dickinson, doing her best as romantic interest for a man old enough to be her father.  Then we come to Walter Brennan at his crotchety best. With a cast like this you just have to have a good movie, but add in a plot with more twists than a fifty foot lariat, then top it off with a great song sung by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson.  Pure entertainment.  No deep philosophy, just lots of action and adventure. Treat yourself to a piece of the time when movies were made for fun 
 I've had the t-shirt/sweatshirt combination for a couple of months, and they are holding up well to use.  The sweatshirt appears to be good weight, but the t-shirt is a little light.  I would buy these again 
 Product is fine, no surprises. It is exactly as described, good fit, good quality 
 If you like books about the mother-daughter conflict, this is what you may be looking for. Amy Tan wrote an incredibly captivating story of Ruth, a American-born Chinese ghostwriter of (ironically) self-help books, who is a perfectionist to the degree that she feels restrained, has mute spells once every year and has a deep aversion against her mother. The old lady, Lu Ling, starts showing signs of dementia and Ruth gets worried. Ruth worries a lot generally, but mostly about herself, her life, her image (even self-image), analyzing every detail, constantly referring to her being Chinese in the US and thinking that this is the source of all her problems. With her mother sick, Ruth remembers the manuscript given to her by LuLing some time ago and her mother urging her to read it. Unfortunately, Ruth, opposing her mother's background and lifestyle, has never mastered Mandarin to the degree allowing her to read Chinese characters without difficulty, so she needs the help of the translator. When he reveals her mother's autobiography to Ruth, she learns the most astonishing truths and the facts about her mother allow her to understand her mother and come to terms with herself. The secrets Ruth may have learned earlier, if only she listened to her mother, are laid now in plain view in front of her. This could be creating more problems for a person of Ruth's personality, but, strangely enough, this shock is what she needs to accept herself and let go of the phobias and obsessions, which have been haunting her all her life. The book is divided into two parts, first one being more of an introduction to Ruth's character, and the second one (longer) - LuLing's manuscript. They complete each other very well, the story is superb, the book is well rounded up and reads fluidly. The only "but" I might have that some themes are treated a bit superficially, but I guess this is difficult to avoid in a book touching the subject so serious as a generation conflict in the immigrant family 
 This is the first book I have read from this author.  I am truly amazed at how well I enjoyed his style.  It kind of reminded me of some of the good Stuart Woods books I have read.  I plan on reading many more from Michael Connelly.  Great read, you won't be disappointed, trust me 
 This book has many strengths, the greatest of which is its application of  family systems theory to religious congregations. Benyei, a psychotherapist  who specializes in congregational dispute resolution, explains systems  theory in down-to-earth terms and makes its relevance clear at every turn.  Her discussions of the role of transference (clergy as representative of  God and parents) and the human needs of clergy are insightful. The case  history she presents of a (real but disguised) troubled church is  especially interesting, and the practical recommendations and glossary at  the end make this an unusually valuable book on a difficult topic 
 Set in post WW II Hawaii, "A Little Too Much is Enough" chronicals the life experiences of a young Chinese-Hawaiian woman growing up in Honolulu from the perspectives of various members of her extended family.  A very rich, colorful, highly ethnic portrayal of Hawaii's development into a major tourist location and that development's effects on the native population.  Several core incidents and experiences are told, and re-told, through severl different voices and perspectives, yeilding a rich texture in which one comes to savor the totality of the experiene's effects on the entire Wong family.  Delivered in a highly vernacular Hawaiian voice throughout, "A Little Too Much is Enough" in the end stands as not just a wonderful story, but also as a rich, multicultural experienc 
 For a one-day snapshot in the life of neurosurgeon Henry Perowne, "Saturday" covers a lot of ground.  From an unexpectedly early awakening, to a fiercely competitive game of squash, to a run-in with demented street thugs, to a family get-together gone horribly awry, to a late-night surgical procedure, Mcewan transforms the ordinary into the transcendent in a way that reminds me of Updike's best work.   Terrorism, evolutionary theory, genetic predeterminism, art, socio-economic strata, parenting, and mortality all take their turns on stage, with Mcewan's brilliant prose teasing universal truths from this utterly realistic microcosm he's created.  Seen through the eyes of a perfectly-drawn character whose profession is known for its God complexes, Perowne's realization that his Saturday is coming to a close and that he, like any mere mortal, had better prepare for the coming Sunday in his life, resonates perfectly.  For me, genre fiction is where much of today's most interesting writing can be found, yet this novel serves as proof that certain literary fiction can both entertain and enlighten.  -Kevin Joseph, author of "The Champion Maker" 
      This is an execellent book. On the downside i'm 72 years old so i should have read this 40 years ago.   The author is clear & it's readable for most anyone.   However i think today's readers may find the material dated, with some cliche's that were probably very "hip" in the mid '60's. Yet today i beleive we can con verese with most anyone & arrive at these type mind games on our own without the need of a therapist.     If i were able to time travel back to the '60s, Woodstock, Timothy Leary,...& read this book with "that" mind-set, i would rate the book 5 big stars 
 As a first-time buyer from Amazon.com, I was very impressed and happy with the service. Manual of Laboratory/Diagnostic Test was in good shape, excellent condition. I receive this book within 7 days. I will continue to do business with Amazon.com   
 We just cannot stop playing this CD ever since we ordered it!  Each song is a unique performance.  You will not be disappointed in this purchase.  If you listen to & like the samples, you will LOVE the full CD 
 Very easy reading within a few hours. It covers all the 5S in a simple practical way with excellent examples. Shows a lot of pictures that help visualizing work area before and after 5S. I recommend strongly this book. Eleven plants in the comapny i work for are using it now 
 The insights into natural health in this book are backed by science yet are easy to understand. Get the truth about Pro-Biotics without the hype and you could change your health for the better and live a longer happier life. 
 These are not happy days for liberals.  Something seems to have gone wrong with the government of experts-like-us that liberals have built over the last century. The idea was that poverty was "not a personal failure, but a failure of society."  Liberals reversed societal failure, Fogel writes, with government programs to mitigate material inequality.  The result is that the material condition of the poor is much better than it was a century ago.    But the spiritual condition of the poor has deteriorated.  Things like "drug addiction, alcoholism, births to unmarried teenage girls, rape, the battery of women and children, broken families, violent teenage death, and crime are generally more severe today than they were a century ago."  This is a problem for progressives, Fogel realizes, because unless they get their act together and do something about the "maldistribution of spiritual resources" they are going to lose their political power and their program of egalitarianism.  Fogel sees new hope for progressives in the Great Awakening model developed by William G. McLoughlin in Revivals, Awakenings, and Reform.  The idea is that each existential crisis in American life leads to a religious Great Awakening, and thence to political reform and renewal.  If liberals can co-opt the current religious revival then they can develop programs to provide the poor in spirit with spiritual values such as a "sense of purpose," a "vision of opportunity," a "sense of the mainstream of work and life," and so on.  Never mind that such a program of spiritual values would amount to a government church.  Still, this is a worthy look at the progressives' Big Problem and deserves its four stars 
 I am not ordinarily a big fan of Wes Craven, but his casting of Gerard Butler as Dracula was pure genius.  Gerry was in turns sexy, charming, terrifing, seductive, and was always pure alpha male!  (Face it, the guy could sell cat food and I'd buy it!)  The story is a new twist to an old tale which I felt was believable and well written.  It was also lovely to see the New Orleans that was, and will hopefully be again.  I felt that the early scenes were very slow, but once the film got going I loved it.  It's time the old Dracula story got a fresh update and this was very well done indeed 
 An Empty Lap is not all smiles and hugs, but adoption is a serious and demanding effort, and An Empty Lap gives an honest appraisal of the struggles - and the triumphs - one real world couple experienced when they pursued the path of adoption.  I would encourage anyone considering adoption to read An Empty Lap, and if international adoption is anywhere on your horizon of possibilities, this is clearly a "Must Read" item. While the international adoption scene is constantly shifting, the lessons in An Empty Lap will apply to any international adoption, regardless of the country of origin.   That the author chose to give a real and imperfect face - that of her and her husband - to the challenges of adoption only serves to make An Empty Lap that much more relevant to the real world that you, the prospective parent, will face. Written in an engaging and literate style, you will come away more learned than you began...and much like adoption itself, in the end you get a happy ending 
 If there is one thing that most people don't understand about hardcore, it's the role of musicianship in the genre. The only important aspects in hardcore are the messages, the conviction of the band, and the band's integrity. Hardcore remains more relavant than ever because so many people see that this music leaves no room for posturing and bull. It's a genre in which the message and delivery are just as important as the competence of it's musicians (Mike Judge couldn't play drums to save his life, and no one ever accused Minor Threat of musical prowess, but each are legendary for their level of intensity and conviction).  In the case of Hatebreed's "Perseverance", the message is clear: These guys are angrily confident. Jamey Jasta's conviction is it's clearest ever on this disc, as he forcefully twists his hatred into hope for conquering his demons. It's a unique thing for a band to incite unbelievable anger and undeniable self-confidence in the same album. Not many albums offer the venom and the antidote. The music is hammering and heavy, as heavy as any hardcore album can get. The band can play blistering hardcore as well as anyone else, but once again, the message is what makes you mosh. 
 Am I going to be sick? I think I ate(read) too much! I couldn't help myself myself because this wonderful title sated my appetite for mystery, cats ('natch), and turkey. Nuff said. This is perhaps the most invigorating marriage of turkey and cats I've yet read. You don't have to be a pilgrim to give thanks for Mr. L. J. Braun 
 This book was bought because my hubby lent out Books 1 thru 3 of this series.Since he never got them back, he definitely wanted them replaced!   He is a Stephen King collector! Since all the other books were in hard back, this one was bought as a hardback, to replace the soft cover one.   This series has gotten my 19 year old son, who doesn't like to read, to read. He and my 16 year old avid reader, are having to share, as they are BOTH reading it!  Cudos to Amazon for getting it here so fast, while their interest in the series was still there!  Thanks again,  Jea 
 I stumbled across this novel in the library and picked it up merely because I am an Endo fan.  I experienced the book on two levels.  On one, the novel relates the trauma of unreturned love.  Most people can relate to that theme, and it tended to draw me through the story.  The parallel with Jesus' life is not meant to be exact.   Mitsu represents the suffering of humanity, as she suffers in her one way.  Every episode of Mitsu's life is tragic.  For some people, the tragedy might be oevrdone, but I was left sleepless by it.  I would recommend The Girl I Left Behind to anyone who enjoys Shusaku Endo's novels 
 Sigmund Freud has done an amazing research in the field of Dreams and their meanings, you will be amazed how every single detail in the dream has a meaning (According to Sigmund Freud - not that I agree with him). And it is very impressive. Personally I enjoyed this book very much 
 The breakdown to Batdance, all I have to say is:  FUNKY AS HELL AND A MASTERPIECE!!! 
 The reason I bought the Burning Tigris is that, unlike some histories of the Armenian Massacre, it gives extensive information about those around the world who DID care, who DID help. Too often I've heard people say, "No one did anything to help." But it is heartening to know that many did try, and that America was in the forefront. The record of the efforts to alleviate the suffering of the victims, and protest the genocide serves in itself as a proof that this atrocity occurred.  Sadly, denial and persecution continues, as one may see by some of the reviews here. However, Armenians have all the more reason to be grateful to America for giving us freedom and safety. Writing bad reviews and denying facts is the worst Ottoman-defending Turks can do to us now. 
 Powerful prose & imagery from a writer who learned to write, it is said, from the Bible. It reads much like the story of Esther from the old Testament. Pearl Buck's characterizations are built up layer by careful layer with simple words and in spare phrases. This is a lovely book 
 This book is a bit dated. But since I am really a dummy in this area, it has been good to bone up my knowledge, as I gear up to buy and build up a audio home theater - I skipped most of the stuff on the video chapters as I don't plan a movie theater at home.  It does need to be updated. PC and network information are old, so are some of the things around emerging standards. It could also do with some pictures and wiring diagrams - I am no dummy with electronics, but had difficulty understanding what was mean by a central panel, that could be placed in my basement or some place out of sight 
  This book provides great insight for readers into an often misunderstood and underappreciated area of our country. I was born and reared in the highlands of Southern Appalachia and I was happy to read of some things I already knew and then learn some new things. The book has great photos and descriptive essays.   And, Amazon, under the "Better Together" banner, suggested buying "People Of Passion: Stories of Faith & Determination That Will Touch Your Heart & Warm Your Soul." What a great companion book this proved to be!   Through 48 brief personal stories, "People of Passion" presents 200 years of history in the Southern Appalachian Highlands. Beginning in the 1770s and going through the 1960s, these dramatic accounts are in chronological order, which I think makes them even more interesting. These informative chronicles often tugged at my heart strings and definitely caused me to even more deeply appreciate the courage and sacrifices of our ancestors. I was also surprised at some things that I had no idea of. "People of Passion" is an informative, entertaining, and inspirational book that complements well "The Appalachians: America's First & Last Frontier. 
 The soundtrack of Philadelphia is excellent with multiple tracks that are worthy of purchasing the album. I personally enjoy Neil Young's "Philadelphia" which I believe is one of his best songs and should have won the Oscar for Best Song. I definitely recommend adding the album to your collection 
 Lucas is a money manager, but with a most unusual perspective. He is an heir to the founder of the Carnation Company and the money he manages is that of his family. As a combination of custodian of the family wealth and one of the shareholders of that wealth, he not only has to answer to others, but in a way unlike other money managers, his accountability is different and higher. His advice on how to manage money is interesting, but not the really significant point of the book.   What is truly significant about the book is what Lucas says about how to effectively carry out the transfer of wealth from generation to generation. There always seems to be a story in the news regarding a legal action over the transfer of wealth from one generation to the next. Sometimes it is about a spoiled "poor little rich kid" who never has had to accept responsibility and squanders much of the family fortune. Others are about relatives squabbling over shares, sometimes between them, other times an "outsider", such as a new spouse or caretaker is involved and sometimes both. Whatever the circumstances, enormous legal fees are run up, often for little to no gain.  Lucas is very straightforward about how it has been done in his family and their strategy is something that should be listened to. He argues that a young person should first work and be successful outside the family before being given a responsible position inside a family owned business or organization. Children in his family are expected to earn their positions rather than simply have them handed to them and then be protected against failure. He also puts forward arguments that a family member put in a position to mind the family wealth should have earned the position rather than just be placed in it. He also sides with people such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffett who are lobbying against the repeal of the estate tax. Lucas, like so many very wealthy people, believes that the creation of a permanent aristocracy of ultra-wealthy people in America is not in the best interests of the country.  As Lucas is quick to point out, there are disagreements among his family members, just like in all other family units. He is very frank in discussing such issues, how people who marry into a wealthy family are perceived and how a divorce can change the dynamics. Several very important questions that must be raised and honestly answered are put forward. They are:  *) Who in the family has demonstrated a strong interest/competency in allocating capital and has a track record of doing so successfully? *) Who in the family is clearly in sync with the family culture and value system and is generally sensitive and able to hear the voices of others in family discussion? *) Who in the family displays the skills and temperament to be a good moderator and mediator of conflicts, if and when they arise? *) Who is willing to hold themselves accountable? *) Who in the family displays strong business instincts and acumen and has options to build a lucrative business career away from the family? *) Are there family members who exhibit entrepreneurial traits or are superb at executing the vision of others? *) Who is healthy enough to manage the physical and emotional rigors of managing the family wealth?  Any family that can honestly answer these questions without degenerating into open and extensive hostility is guaranteed to be successful in just about anything.   Lucas also discusses the obligations of wealth, not only the proper management of it, but also how to spread it around so that it is used for the best benefit of society. At a time when we hear story after story of greedy, crooked executives and wealthy people snapping up all they can, this book is very refreshing. There are people who honestly accept the responsibility of wealth and operate with the best interests of society in mind. All too often we hear wealthy people say that their best interests and those of society are coincident. Lucas is to be commended when he states the contrary position, lives it and communicates that position to others. 
 The title track, "Better Go" reminds me a whole lot that this CD sets up a lot like "Buck and Buddy - Blowin' the Blues"; but then comes Ben Webster swooping in on "How Long Has This Been Going On" and I'm immediately reminded how much better of a CD this is - no disrespect to Buck (one of my all-time favorites) or Buddy. But, my God, what a beautiful pair Webster and Edison make! 'Sweets' rips up the opener and right away shows that he is in top form, with George Duvivier laying the 4/4 down. "Kitty", track three, has Hank Jones comp-ing nicely over Edison, then "the Brute" blows 'em away...leaving Hank to do the best he can. "My Romance" finds Webster romantic, indeed, and I can almost hear the string orchestra on "Ballads" in the back of my head. Just beautiful. Jones opens "Did You Call Her Today" with a nice Duke/Count double tribute, and 'Sweets' rides over the "Mellowtone-like" composition first, besting Ben this time, but not by much. Jones then gets off his best solo of the session, again comp-ing nicely to the finish. 'Sweets' closes out with the ballad "Embracable You". Clarence Johnston deserves a mention on drums due to perfect backing on everything, especially this one - he comes in halfway through and doesn't disturb 'Sweets' one bit. All in all, a real All-Star date for a real All-Star pair 
 Always wanted this movie collection set.  LOVE all the original Star Trek movies with Spock.  CDs arrived later than I expected though, and the shipping was not 2-Day like I was guaranteed.  Other than that, they arrived in good condition and the CDs all worked 
 This book detailes the corruption of not only the Clintons but Arkansas and Washington D.C. as well. The book paints a picture of the idealistic  and somewhat tortured personal lives of two people who get caught up in the  corruption of not only Arkansas, but Washington D.C.  The book does get  kind of bogged down in discussing tangents to the main theme of the book,  the Clintons, but its meant to show what kind of Arkansas and Washington  D.C. they came into politically.  The book, although defintely not  pro-Clintons, avoids purely polemical and emotional language and writing.   It is a sad commentary on politics in general and our country when corrupt  people can get into high places 
 I won't go into a synopsis of the book as that's been done by several previous reviewers, but I will say that I had put this on my wish list and it was recently given to me as a belated birthday gift (thank you, Vinny!).  I'm so glad I got it.  I usually do most of my reading on the subway to and from work, and this was the perfect train book.  Couldn't wait to get a seat on the train so I could pull it out and read!  I am a big fan of hot, steamy love stories and this book fit the bill perfectly, particularly the stories by Lori Foster, Erin McCarthy and Kylie Adams.  It also introduced me to several authors I'd never read before and will probably read again, with one exception.  My only complaint about this book is the story by Katherine Garbera.  It wasn't the story itself - the premise was a good one and the dialogue between the two characters was well done - it was the way it was written.  Garbera and her editor really ought to enroll themselves in a refresher course on basic English grammar, punctuation and sentence structure.  The story was riddled with sentence fragments which, for me, made it a bit difficult to read.  Granted, I may be a bit pickier than most because I used to be an English teacher, but people who write like that really bother me.  It bothers me even more that her editor doesn't take her to task for it.  It appears Ms. Garbera has never met a comma she could live with.  This is not to say that I think the woman can't write - she can - she just needs to form complete sentences - all the time.  I will have to thoroughly look over her books the next time I'm in the bookstore.  If they are all written in this fashion, I will probably never read her again.  Those sentence fragments are annoying and distracting!  Other than that, this was a really good book, perfect for people who have limited time to sit and read a full-length novel.  And it's not just for Christmas; it's a good read no matter what the season, especially if you like the perfect blend of romance and toe-curling sex in your books.  Read it and enjoy 
 The resolution is not great, but it still works in many situations. Am I glad that I have the book at home? You bet. But I travel and teach a great deal, and this CD lives in my laptop. I love the searchability and thumbnail views 
 Every page put an exclamation point in my head, a smile on my lips, or a field guide into my hands 
 This book is very well written.  As reviewed earlier, it's not just a book that birders will enjoy.  Anyone with an interest in nature, the scope of human inquiry, and even relationships will enjoy this read.  As a skeptic, it helped to balance my overall opinion and keep things in perspective without crossing over to the conspiracy theory, name-calling clique.  There is no doubt that Gallagher et al. BELIEVE they saw an IBWO.  I might even be convinced that there is a 50/50 chance that there are some still out there.  But with the money and politics involved coupled with the professional egos at stake, we need a photo.  The level of evidence does not merit a major article in "Science" magazine that lends creedence to their claims.  Would their evidence be enough in the fields of molecular genetics, cell biology, or endocrinology?  Ah, no.  Is their evidence enough to write an interesting and entertaining book and to encourage birders to continue an earnest search?  Absolutely.  One final interesting thought.....  It is interesting that the "Ivory Tower Ivory-bill Searchers" from Cornell kept their early work private to protect the bird from obnoxious birders invading the swamp when, in reality, they themselves act like...... obnoxious birders invading the swamp.  Ain't it funny what a degree and a job title will let you do?  It's a great book.  Maybe I'll write one about searching for Bachman's Warblers at Congaree........ 
 IF YOU HAVE SEEN SORDID LIVES, YOU MUST HAVE THIS CD, AND IF YOU HAVENT YOU SHOULD SEE THE MOVIE AND GET THIS CD. MY FAVORITE SONG IS NUMBER  
 Don't get this movie wrong because it's one of his older ones, because I know I did.  I first saw it at home on a movie channel, passively, but it quickly got my attention, especially at the superbly choreographed fight scenes.  There were plenty of them, and whilst I won't spoil it, the very last fight scene(s) were so thoroughly thought out with such creativity that I saw this is a *must* buy for any action and/or martial arts fan 
 Upon recommendation, I picked up Karen Finley's Shock Treatment. The first reading was in itself, well, ahem, shocking. The use of "extraordinary" vulgar language begged me to ask, how did Finely write such prose, with a seemingly angst ridden, bitter taste for human comprehension? After the second reading, the misogyny surfaced, the cruddy underworld of perverse thoughts and perhaps the darker world of the human psyche. The work itself is appalling, disgusting, vulgar, and the intimate relationship between writer and reader is tested. Her work, parallel's the social intercourse of the appalling, disgusting and vulgar acts of misogyny, sexual abuse, the apparent lack of societal boundaries. This work, alas, is a piece in itself creating judgements and strong feelings. I highly recommend Finley's work to those who appreciate and tolerate such works 
 Is not one of my greatest movies to watch because the story was so silly but the soundtrack for this movie is awesome. Yes! I'm not ashamed to say that I owe the movie and cd. "Xanadu" was great for me because I love Olivia Newton-John so much. She has such a great voice before Christina Aquilera, Whitney Housten, & Mariah Carey. Anyone living in New York? "Xanadu" is coming to Broardway 
 I found this group because of American Idol. Chris Sligh sang Typical a couple of weeks ago and I was instantly intrigued. Thanks to the Internet, I was able to discover some info about the song and ended up buying the CD. All I can say is "WOW"! I love this music and can't stop listening to it. Besides Typical, my very favorite tracks are Stare at the Sun and You Are Mine, but they are all terrific.  And I have to add, the drummer is outstanding; the complexity and beauty of his rhythms are breathtaking. Thanks for the great music, guys 
 After only a limited exposure on a new Panasonic DVD recorder, I am a fan of the DVD RAM format.  While I haven't had time to test the stated 100,000 time rewriting capability (and probably won't in my lifetime) I do appreciate the continuous editing capability, including the ability to create and title chapters after the initial recording.  I can see why this is now the prefered format in Japan, and why it is so pervasive in Europe.  I can only hope that it will catch on here. Until it does, be aware that there are only a few newer DVD players--and precious few PCs--that can read this format.   
 The Warrior Elite, written by Dean Couch, is an excellent account of the type of training that makes a Navy Seal. The author is with class 228 from start to finish, detailing how many there are (and most of the time how many are left), what they are doing, how they are doing it, and why.   The book is a page-turner for sure and, though in itself interesting stuff, the author doesn't detract at all from the suspense, challenge, and ultimate victory (for some) that entails Navy Seal training. In fact, the author's no-nonsense layout of the training fits the subject matter perfectly. Seen through his eyes, the story of class 228 is stripped of all non-essential happenings, leaving you and I--the readers--with the ability to focus on the struggle and the people struggling.   Speaking for myself, this makes the book much more interesting, and it makes the ultimate value of this book for a general audience much more realizable. Knowing what makes an "elite warrior" on the battlefield is helpful if one wants to be a master of their own trade, whatever that is. In detailing the class of 228's training, Couch gives his readers exactly that knowledge--though it's up to each reader to induce the general principles.  Here's my recommendation: When you catch yourself starting to whine about how hard your everyday life is or when you are wondering what it would take to really master your profession, stop by your local bookstore, pick up this book, take a rest, and then witness the making of Navy Seal class 228. You will see pretty quickly how easy your life is in comparison, and you will be shown the path to success in any field: precise, clear thinking, lots of hard work, repetition, and persistence 
 The Murderdolls are the vile offspring of an alternate universe Motley Crue that was actually evil and Sex Pistols sneering punk.  All twenty one tracks thrash and snarl at lightning speeds with equally hilarious lyrics about everything from zombie girlfriends to goth cliches like slitting one's wrists.  The sound is great if a little repetitive and i don't really care for the White Wedding cover but everything else is roses.  A good listen and a worthy addition to any metalhead's collection.

 "From Chocolate to Morphine" (2004 edition) attempts to be a basic encyclopedic reference of psychoactive drugs and their uses, whose goal is to provide objective information on the risks and benefits of prescription, over-the-counter, illegal, and natural drugs for a modern audience living in a very drug-soaked society. The authors, Dr. Andrew Weil and Winifred Rosen, are forthright about their perspective: "We cannot say that we have no biases about drugs, but we think that we know what our biases are." They don't generally encourage or discourage recreational drug use. Instead, they repeatedly emphasize the necessity of education and avoiding dependency if one is to use drugs beneficially. I say "generally", because the authors' tone betrays obvious disdain for a few drugs and affection for some others.   The authors outline their viewpoint and purpose in the book's first chapter, where they also offer some rather silly advice to parents, teachers, and teens on communicating about drugs. But the book improves from there. Chapters 2-5 provide basic information: What is a Drug, Why People Use Drugs, Relationships with Drugs, and Types of Drugs. This is followed by chapters on Stimulants, Depressants, Psychedelics, Marijuana, a sort of catch-all chapter on Solvents and Inhalants/Deliriants/PCP and Ketamine, and Medical Drugs/Herbal Remedies/Smart Drugs. The information on each drug is not what I would call complete, and it probably isn't meant to be. Caffeine is handled poorly. Its immunosuppressant, diuretic, and damaging effects on the linings of blood vessels are not mentioned. On the other hand, the cases against tobacco and alcohol may be overstated. The book is very hard on heroin, speaks well of marijuana, but omits glaucoma treatment when discussing medicinal uses. The authors don't like anti-depressants, especially SSRIs. I can't say that I blame them, but, oddly, they are more harsh when discussing antihistamines. Descriptions for each drug contain history and basic information on uses, effects, and dangers. One of the best features of "From Chocolate to Morphine" is the Suggested Reading at the end of each chapter, which provides a list of related books and films for those readers who would like more detailed information.  The final chapters of the book address Problems with Drugs, Alternatives to Drugs, and the authors give us some Final Words on the subject of drug use -including some interesting advice regarding the treatment of drug addiction. The Appendix contains about 40 pages of interesting "First Person Accounts and Comments" on drug use, and is followed by a glossary and an index. Dr. Andrew Weil and Winifred Rosen don't hide their contempt for the current drug hysteria and drug policies in the United States. Nor do they deny how easy it is to become dependent on drugs if they are used carelessly or for the wrong reasons. "From Chocolate to Morphine" isn't a definitive work on psychoactive drugs, but it's a good primer that is easy to read. Those who intend to use any of these drugs on a regular basis will want more detailed information, for which the Suggested Reading sections are excellent guides 
 This book has been reviewed nearly to death but I'd like to add my 1½ cents.  Two things struck me while reading this fascinating and frightening work.  First, it's an excellent combination of history and current events within the LDS church.  Of course, there is a lot more to Mormonism than what Krakauer is able to cover here but what there is is covered well.  The murders that form the hub of the book are at the same time almost tangential to the story.  This is really a cold, hard look into the locked closets and under (and into) the beds of a very strange religion.  Second, I'm dumbfounded at the number of people who are taken in by a religion that was dreamed up by a character like Joseph Smith.  The guy was a obvious fraud; a combination of carnival huckster, Mohammad, and David Koresh.  Likewise for Brigham Young 
 This book is the "real thing" a startling account of a dedicated professional German soldier and his real life experiences on the Eastern Front.  What makes this book interesting is, it's factual, historically accurate, and does not bog down into irrelevant viewpoints - there is no filler - it's all action.  The book exclusively describes the day-to-day life and death events of the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front.  It also provides the reader with an unbelievable insight into what it was like to fight the Russians day-after-day, under horrible conditions, without adequate supplies and man power.  The author provides a factual view into the daily life of the German solider on the battlefield.  What I found interesting about this book is the author literally takes a back seat when he is telling his story.  He praises his men and focuses very little on the fact he was a "hero" in his own right - the sign of a professional officer.  Lastly, the author brings to light the brutal way the Russian's treated the unarmed German prisoners of war.  The atrocities, forced labor, starvation, punishment, and beatings come to the surface in a brief description of life in the Russian POW camps.     
 It takes a while to understand, but Suzuki really knew what he was talking about.  It provides a very good understanding of his take on Zen Buddhism 
 Many years ago I was assigned this book to read in college.  The first part was dry (had a lot of statistical analysis).  After I waded through that section though, I couldn't put it down.  I probably finished it in less than three days.  This book caused me to change my opinions on the death penalty completely.  It is very balanced and fair.  What Bedau did was ask the death penalty experts on both sides of the argument to write articles and he put their writings in his book.  The results are amazing!    Don't listen to the two crackpots that gave this book 1 star.  I don't think they have read this book or they would have written the things they did.  This book is really about learning all of the points of view on the death penalty.  Why would anyone oppose becoming informed?  It profoundly changed my life.  How many books can you say this about?  Read it and see for yourself!  Thank you Hugo Adam Bedau 
 Let me tell you how wonderful these pens are: whenever I'm writing with another pen, I find myself longing for the Pilot V5. After writing with these for 7 years, there's just nothing else that compares. For me, the Pilot is the most conducive pen in getting the thoughts in my head onto paper. It's smooth and fluid, writes with the epitome of ease and precision, and has a nice minimalist look. I'v graduated to buying these in boxes rather than just single pens because I hate being without them and having to use "other" pens. Once you try the V5, you'll know what I mean 
 Kirk, McCoy, Scott, Sulu, and Chekov are stranded around the campfire as it were and so they decide to past the time by relating their experiences on the famed Kobyashi Maru test for the benefit of all - especially Dr. McCoy who as a medical officer never took the command school scenario-test.  Each story provides further insight into each of the characters even if it is a little predictable at times. The reader is treated to a better understanding of Kirk's famous solution, a "Die-Hard-like" Chekov episode, a touching Sulu offering, and a very humorous Scott contribution.  It's worth the time it takes to read it even though I have a hard time believing that Captain Sulu would have reacted to the test in the manner that he did 
 Fell in love with this album from the first song and like them all.   Combines many genres of music together to create a unique style that really  rocks my soul.  Very similar in style to PT & The Ghost Notes.  If you  like this, you might like the "I Know What I Want" album from PT  & The Ghost Notes.  Buy this and check out the ghostnotes web site 
 One of the most amazing stories in western literature is Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol.  When brought to the stage, the journey of Ebenezer Scrooge from a horrid, lonely miser to benevolent, vibrant celebrator of Christmas can be an enthralling experience.  The recent production of this show at GeVa Theatre attempted to take the audience on just such an adventure 
 I went in to reading this manga knowing it was confusing but even though I tried to be aware and pay attention closley... certain parts of this manga baffled me to the point of utter frustration but more on that later. First and Foremost for me is the art. It caught my eye like no other manga artwork before had. It's crude almost scribble-esque look is like nothing else and really fits with the chaotic nature of the manga. Second is the creativity of the plot. While the creativity sometimes borders on insanity, I could find no manga cliches here and that is a rare feat.  Like I've said before the plot is confusing. I read this volume multiple times along with volume two and I was still pretty confused. I know it's too deep or whatever but it's just plain incoherent at somne parts which really frustrated me thus I give it a four rather than a five 
 Big Joe Turner for me, is more than just a "blues shouter". Granted, he had been shouting the blues since the late 1930's, about 12-14 years before he recoreded the material heard here. But after a listening of his records it becomes clear that the period chronicalled here (1951-1959) is by far his most essential.   By the late forties, as the liner notes (by Billy Vera) of this superb Rhino collection say, Joe was losing his audience. As the fifties began Joe found himself (in the same boat as Sinatra I might add) moving to a new label, and evolving musically. The first single released from Joe's sessions at the Soul House, Atlantic Records (home to Ray Charles, Ruth Brown, The Drifters and later Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Solomon Burke etc) was Chains Of Love. Chains Of Love (and Sweet Sixteen) being slow, moody, blues masterpieces give this album a brooding opening.   Then however, the mood changes slightly. Honey Hush begins a string of jump blues hits that are often refered to as "proto-rock and roll...an apt term: all tracks through to number 11 were recorded before Elvis's 'Heartbreak Hotel', and really do pepper the early years of the 1950's with the birth of rock 'n' roll. Big Joe's 'Shake, Rattle & Roll' is a fine example. This new style Joe developed throughout the rest of the '50's with the stunning dancefloor hits heard here.   Overall, Joe is an overlooked originator, someone who along with Ray Charles (Mess Around, It Should've Been Me, I Got A Woman etc) started the R&B side of rock 'n' roll, leaving of course, the country side to Elvis Presley, Bill Haley and so on. Joe's music is some of the best made in the golden '50's. A must have for any nostalgia lover, or any lover rock 'n' roll. Joe was rock 'n' rolls first star, and the more people that know it, hear it, love it...the better. 
 "Rum and Razors" is by far the best Donald Bain has written. Going away on a much-needed vacation to the Caribbean, America's favorite amateur sleuth, Jessica Fletcher, soon wishes she was back home in Cabot Cove, Maine. During a therapeutic stroll along the seashore, a body is discovered and everyone at the local inn is thoroughly investigated. I could not put this book down and neither will readers. This mystery is for all Murder, She Wrote fans 
 This is the most wonderful collection of fairytales, which I first encountered in the third grade and have reread countless times since.  I'd rank it with the multicolored Fairy Book series by Andrew Lang as world  class for this genre.  A classic 
 AFTER 2 NIGHTS OF NO SLEEP BECAUSE OUR 18 MONTHS OLD SON FIGURED OUT HOW TO FLIP HIMSELF OUT OF THE PACK N PLAY (WITH JUST SHEER UPPER BODY STRENGTH!)I WAS SO RELIEVED TO FIND THIS CRIB TENT AND IT WAS A PAIN TO PUT TOGETHER (IT TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES) BUT WELL WORTH IT BECAUSE IT WORKS...HE HAS STAYED IN THE PACK N PLAY AND DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE AT ALL THAT HE WAS "TRAPPED", I THINK KIDS DO LIKE THE PLAYFULNESS OF A TENT. MY 4 YEAR OLD WAS JEALOUS! THERE ARE A FEW DOWNSIDES...ITS A PAIN TO SET UP AND BREAK DOWN AND IF YOUR USING THE PACK N PLAY FOR OVER NIGHTS AND TRAVEL IT ISN'T AS PORTABLE AS COULD BE...AND I HAVE AN OLDER PACK N PLAY, ITS FROM '02 WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST BABY SO THE ENDS ARE HIGHER THAN THE SIDES SO THE CLIPS HAVE NO WHERE TO CLIP ONTO BUT IT HASN'T MATTERED. THE SIDE CLIPS HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR STRONG TODDLER IN PLACE. OVERALL THE PRODUCT IS EXPENSIVE AND A PAIN TO SET UP BUT PRICELESS BECAUSE IT LETS THE WHOLE FAMILY SLEEP SOUNDLY AND SAFELY! 
 The first English language biography on Diocletion and a very well written one at that. Stephen Williams is not a professional Roman historian instead he is a professor of philosophy and therin lays the books strength.  Williams writes for the enthusiastic Roman buff and the general reader.  Instead of quoting ancient historians ad nauseum and going off on tangents  he gets to the meat of the matter. How Diocletion and his fellow emperors  were able to pull the empire back from total collapse. He gives detailed  explanations as to what was occurring in the Empire during the 3rd Century  and why. He isn't afraid to offer his own theories where our knowledge of  events are sketchy and he always keeps the book moving along at a brisk  pace. I especially enjoyed the final chapter where he covers the collapse  of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century. It's well written with  a  detailed description of what occurred and why. He also contrast the  collapse of the West with the survival of the Eastern Empire. Wonderful  book for the layman, student, and perhaps even the expert 
 Charles Cross does a wonderful job of capturing the complex life of Jimi Hendrix.After reading his book I come away with one thought that kept nagging at me and that was that Jimi Hendrix was decades ahead of his time.Anyone curious about the inner workings of Rock stars and all the touring that ends up draining their energy will not be disappointed in this book.One of the most profound things I have ever read  occurs On page 225 where Jimi is quoted as saying one time..."When the power of love overcomes the love of power...the world will know peace." There are no boring sections in this book....quite the contrary as I found myself resentful of anything or anyone that got in the way of my reading time.I highly recommend this book to those like me who came of age in that wonderful time of the 60's and also to those younger who want to gain some insight into what makes a Rock n roll legend like Jimi  Hendriks tick and whose life was snuffed out way too soon 
 this one was good but the other ones just seemed better... is still think you should ge 
 With one sprint triathlon under my belt, I was looking for training programs, injury prevention and info on progressing to the Olympic distance triathlon.  SWIMMING CHAPTER:  Jargon/vocabulary guide was helpful.  I would've appreciated more photos or illustrations for the suggested drills.  CYCLING CHAPTER:  Good general information.  The VO2 max and lactate threshold discussions were over my head but will probably come in handy as my training advances.  RUNNING CHAPTER:  This is my strongest event so I didn't find much new information.  The suggested training programs were quite extensive and included discussion on both speed and endurance work.  TRAINING PROGRAMS:  Sprint, Olympic, Half-Ironman and Ironman distances.  STRENGTH TRAINING:  The weakest chapter in my opinion.  Suggested exercises were quite basic.  You'd probably do better with a session or two with a trainer or another reference.  As a newbie, the nutrition and equipment sections were very helpful.  The pricing guidelines came in handy when scouting out bikes. Interesting chapter on training while pregnant.  Overall, this book is a good resource, especially for those new to one or more of the events 
 Be prepared to be glued to your seat throughout much of the time you spend reading Harlan Coben's latest thriller, The Woods. The primary plot pertains to an incident that occurred twenty years ago, in which two teens were found murdered and two others were never seen again after they walked into the woods near their summer camp. This plot has many twists, turns and surprises. The subplot involves the trial being prosecuted by Paul Copeland -- a county prosecutor and one of the four teens involved in the camp incident -- of an African-American woman who claims to have been raped by some rich white male students while attending a fraternity party (sound familiar -- Duke?, lacrosse players?). Coben weaves his main plot and interesting subplot together in a manner that will keep the pages flying through your fingers and in a way that will cause you to lose all track of time. And he has developed characters that are real enough to care about, even with their weaknesses. Are their some implausibilities. Sure, there are -- but they in no way detract from this very entertaining and suspenseful book. While I usually agree with reviews by Publishers Weekly, in this case I strongly do not. I'm much more in agreement with the Library Journal review. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of The Woods, and then settle in for a real fun reading experience 
 What can you add to such glowing reviews?  I'd just like to share that you can now purchase this book in a lap-sized board book format.  That's wonderful, as many people have pointed out that the detailed illustrations are better when viewed in the larger format.  For those of us who want our babies and toddlers to enjoy unrestricted access to their books without cringing at the thought of the pages being ripped, the lap-size is the perfect solution!  I'm finding more and more of these available now, including "The Napping House" and the bedtime favorite "Time For Bed. 
 Despite only lasting three seasons, Due South has spawned a number of loyal fans.  The show depicts the adventures of Mountie Benton Fraser and Chicago PD Detective Ray Vecchio.  The pair work together to solve crimes with the occasional assistance of either Ben's or Ray's dead father's ghosts, Ben's deaf wolf, and several others.  Episodes have wonderful, quirky humor and an excellent selection of then-up-and=coming Canadian musicians, e.g.:  Sarah McLachlan, Ashley McIsaac, etc.    The one reason I gave this set less than 5 stars was the quality of both the packaging and engineering.  I won't belabor the point about the poor package design and labeling.  To preserve your disks, put them in another CD case.  Engineering, on the other hand, is dreadful.  I can see ghosting and artifacting on my 27 inch TV, so I can only imagine what it would look like on a larger screen.    Season Three is on its way and I am hoping the quality is much better.  
 A series of essays, most of them disclosing way too much and certainly not flattering, but also funny and stark. Underneath his "I'm a pervert, take it or leave it" demeanor, Mr. Ames seems to be a sensitive, pleasant, and fairly nice guy. The essays, per usual for him, border on repulsive, but don't quite get there because of his gift for story telling and sentiment. After reading two of his collections, I don't think I'll buy more because they seem repititive, but they certainly are interesting reads. 
 As an admitted Slashotdot-reading, command-line geek, I looked forward to this book, but as a finicky reader and former English Lit major I was skeptical.  Turns out it's great on both levels:  as a topical, informative text and as a downright compelling collection of short thriller-type stories.  For those who have some familiarity with the subject matter, this book rings completely true and for those who do not, it's still fun and understandable.  It's an expensive book, so I waited a while, but in retrospect it delivers on the high price.  Unlike most of the novels I read which wind up on my living room shelves for a while or are passed along to friends, this one wound up on the reference shelf in my computer room along with other network security books (and with a few post-it bookmarks sticking out to boot).  If you are hesitating because of the price or are worried that the writing will disappoint, I can assure you that you will be pleasantly rewarded for your investment.  Best thing I've read in the genre since Stoll's superb "The Cuckoo's Egg. 
 Enjoyed THE FORTUNATE PILGRIM by Mario Puzo, written before THE GODFATHER . . . this one also looks at the Italian-American experience, but from the perspective of a family where the woman holds the power.  I was moved by the story of Lucia Santa and her journey from the mountain farms of Italy to the streets of New York . . . she hoped for a better life, but instead found herself living in Hell's Kitchen and in a bad marriage where she had to raise six children on her own.  Their lives also fascinated me, as did Puzzo's description of what like was life in the twenties, thirties and forties . . . it made me feel like I was actually there--right with the characters.  After the novel was over, I wondered how come it never was made into a major movie . . . I did found out that THE FORTUNATE PILGRIM was instead made into a TV mini-series in 1988, starring Sophia Loren and Edward James Olmos . . . so I now know what I'll be watching when I rent my next DVD!      
 The story starts with the plot to terminate one "inconvenient" whistle-blower (Faith Lockhart).  The unexpected complication is a burglarizing P.I. (Lee Adams) who frustrates the assassination and rescues the damsel in distress.  Congress is involved as well as the CIA and FBI.  The 451 page adventuresome chase is through double-crossing who-can-you-trust terrain.  The romance is unsurprising, typical, and some of the best dialog.  The 'run and hide for your  life' is great suspense.  The counter attack/sting is pure Baldacci brilliance.  Saving Faith gives you a front-row seat to a great adventure/mystery but doles out the background details necessary to full understanding one plot twist at a time 
 Greg Boyd is an awesome writer and this book is by far a "must buy" for all Christians, whether or not you agree with the Open Theism theology.  Since I DO attend his church, I do agree with majority of his theology, but our theologies should not be basing our "star ratings."  This book provides a CLEAR analysis of his view on the Bible.  This book provides a solid argument for the Open Theism theology 
 This book has everything including twists in the plot. I read it in one day because I couldn't put it down! 
 Many life coaches and business gurus use most of what Napoleon Hill learned over 50 years ago.  Anthony Robbins has built most of his core philosophy on Mr. Hill's teachings 
  I have read this book several times, and each time I learn something new and something intimate regarding my dreams, hopes, and desires in life.  It has inspired me to embrace life each day and actively tell those around me how much I love and appreciate them because we are never promised tomorrow, nor our next breath for that matter!  This book is not only a touching, revealing story of one couples life, love, and loss; but it is a blueprint for how to take inventory of what is important to you and what you would like to see accomplished in your life's journey before that journey comes to an end. One phrase in the book that sticks with me is to, "accept no compromise in life".  "The Thorn Hearts" is peppered with sage wisdom, insight, and practical application should you find yourself, or a loved one, diagnosed with a terminal/life threatening illness.  I highly recommend "The Thorn Hearts"!!! 
 If you are looking for a how to book this is not it. If you are looking at what God does in our lives in shaping us spiritually through parenting then this is the book for you 
 This is really rich book with a lot of helpful practical instructions to teaching thinking in classes.  
                   Brown,a Democrat and a liberal,has written a very good book on the severe deficiencies(for instance,the vast number of workers ,who obtain jobs in second and third world countries as a result of outsourcing and globalization, are paid incomes that are far too small to buy any American exports at all.The result is the creation of additional excess supply and decreases in the standard of living everywhere brought on by deficiencies in aggregate purchasing power)that exist as a result of globalization.The same deficiencies were noted by Ross Perot in three books written in 1992,by Pat Buchanan in 1998 in his "The Great Betrayal",and by Lou Dobbs in his recent "Exporting America:How Corporate Greed is Shipping American Jobs Overseas".All three are authentic conservatives who have broken with a Republican party establishment that has,since 1978, substituted the libertarian anarchist globalization  arguments of  Grover Norquist,Murray Rothbard,Milton Friedman,Ayn Rynd,Ludwig von Mises,Fredrich von Hayek,Arthur Laffer,and George Gilder for those of conservatives such as Adam Smith,David Ricardo,George Washington,Alexander Hamilton,Douglas MacArthur,Dwight D Eisenhower,and ,yes,Richard Nixon.Unfortunately,the title of the book was poorly chosen.There is a sound and valid free trade position that opposes the special interests of oligopolistic industries.A better title for the book would have been"Globalization is not Free Trade:The Myth of Globalization".Authentic free trade is based on comparative advantage,not the absolute advantage that is the foundation of the libertarian anarchist argument for globalization.Unfortunately,B does not deal with the fact that Smith and Ricardo would be opponents of globalization(Only Dobbs mentions this fact).Globalization is not free trade,as free trade is automatically defined within the context of the theory of comparative advantage.It is of vital importance that anyone concerned about the misrepresentation of the authentic free trade position read Part IV, chapter II,pp.420-440 of The  Wealth of Nations.For instance,Smith is opposed to tariffs (and quotas)only if it is the case that the purpose of the tariff is purely protectionist(sought by a special interest group of oligopolistic manufacturers)in nature.Smith would support  retaliatory tariffs against countries engaging in obvious protectionist behavior,such as violations of GATT,manipulation of international currency values and/or massive dumping,such as China,India,and Mexico, as long as there is some probability that the counter tariff"...will procure the repeal of the high duties or prohibitions complained of"(Smith,p.435,Modern Library edition).Only if there is no probability of getting the offending country to stop its behavior would Smith forgo retaliation.Finally,Smith is a moderate supporter of the revenue tariff,on balance. He imposed such tariffs when he became a customs official in Scotland.We can end this review by taking Jack Kemp as an example of a conservative who has been completely misled/confused by the substitution of the libertarian,athiest,anarchist arguments of the two von's,Mises and Hayek,for the moral,conservative,deist arguments of Adam Smith.Libertarian Anarchism has nothing to do with conservatism.These philosophies are completely opposed on political,social, and economic grounds.This was the case at the beginnings of our Republic.Washington,Hamilton,Madison,Jay,Franklin,and Adams are the conservatives.Mason,Randolph,Henry,and Paine are the libertarians

 Does anyone know where to find a copy of the book, "Idle Talk on a Night Boat". The preface was included in Wild Ivy, and I have tired to search it out. Does it not exist or has it not been translated 
 A beautiful film about an amazing man. The universal message of John Lennon and what he stands for echos clearly against today's troubled world.

 The issue of life's origins has long been troubling to scientists and lay observers alike.  When Charles Darwin wrote to Joseph Hooker that life likely formed in "some warm little pond" from elemental chemicals, he set in motion years of study by countless researchers.  The question hinged on what was necessary to initiate "the spark of life".  Wills and Bada recount much of the work done to explain that obscure beginning.  For them, the pivotal event is the famous Miller-Urey experiment of the 1950s.  First hailed as a, perhaps "the", major breakthrough, it was challenged and suffered from more updated information.  The authors revive the original concept, enlarging it to restore its validity.  The means they use to achieve this is two-pronged: an investigation of life from "the bottom up" matched by another from "the top down".     Wills and Bada clearly wish to update the reading public in what has transpired in "origins of life" research since Stanley Miller zapped his own "little pond" in a sealed flask.   They acknowledge the objections later researchers posed about Earth's early environment.  They also confront the scenarios offered by Graham Cairns Smith and Gunter Wachtershauser.  The former suggested organic compounds might "learn" replication from clay crystals, while the latter suggested the energy transfer methods associated with iron pyrites would support metabolic paths prior to the formation of cells.  Wachtershauser's mechanism, they admit, works admirably in the environment of sea-floor vents, which were almost certainly present on the early Earth.  Yet, attractive as both suggestions are, the authors find updated versions of the original Miller-Urey more convincing.    The issue is, of course, Darwin's evolution by natural selection.  How early in life's beginnings could "selection" begin its winnowing process?  Building up molecules that will ultimately establish life-sustaining forms is unsatisfactory.  In order to function, selection must have replication and variation in place.  The replication means sustained patterns of one form, while variation suggests many types of forms allowing selection to take place in a stable environment.  That, insist the authors, means something like a gene must have been established reasonably early in life.  Since a gene's task is the production of proteins which accelerate the process, there must have been a feedback loop system in action.  For some, this structure suggests an early form of RNA, leading to what they call "the RNA world".  The authors contend that RNA, even in simple form, is still too complex and fragile a molecule to have survived Earth's harsh conditions.  Instead, they propose what they deem a "Peptide Nucleic Acid" or "PNA".  Not suffering RNA's delicate nature, PNA in various forms could find havens in tidal pools, tenaciously bound to rocks and forming oily films as protection against desiccating sunlight.  Thus Darwin's "warm little pond" finds vindication 150 years later, buttressed by Miller and Urey's experiment and better understanding of biochemical processes.  All this may sound like intimidating reading.  It's far from that.  The authors have gone to some effort to keep the language in this work clear and explicit.  They build their case carefully, leaving the reader in no doubt of their intention and the significance of their points.  They provide reasonably expressed counters to other proposals, carefully explaining the reasons for their own objections to earlier hypotheses.  Beyond these considerations, they also discuss the possibilities of extra-terrestrial life, particularly that on Mars and satellites of the giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn.  To enhance this discussion, a number of William Hartmann's paintings are included.  They are lovely, but add little to the discussion.  Other illustrative material is more cogent to the theme.  One might also wish that the authors had found a synonym for "primeval soup".  I lost count of the number of times it's used.  The book is a worthwhile read, but isn't the final answer on the questions of life's origins.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada 
 Like other reviewers here, I saw the movie first and was then prompted to read the original book. But I wanted to read the book because I felt like the movie had a good backbone it just really lacked in presentation and character development. After reading the book I can see why. The movie is an extremely loose adaptation.  The novel starts off in present day with a Borden descendant discovering his heritage for the first time in a memoir about the magician Alfred Borden. From here we go on to actually read the Borden memoir. There is a brief interlude of present-day story, and then we go on to read another memoir, this one by Borden's nemesis, Rupert Angier, another magician.  The way the story flows allows for multiple realizations by the reader. (And don't worry about knowing some of the secrets if you've already seen the movie, the book is different enough that nothing will be ruined. In fact it will actually be helpful because you'll see how obviously everything is laid out before you).   What the book also accomplishes is a very well-developed exploration of the theme of duality and human nature. While the movie may have attempted to express this, none of the characters were explored enough to really give the idea gravity. In the book, as we read the intimate details of each man's journal, and discover many of their secrets and experiences, we see what obsession and resentment and bitterness can do to people.  The ending is a bit sudden and definitely not as compelling as the rest of the book, but The Prestige still packs a big punch and is one of those enjoyable reads that you just can't put down. If you're at all interested, check this book out today. You won't be sorry 
 This is an excellent study of Paul's letter.  It helps us understand that Christ gives us strengh.  We don't have to strive to look good in others eyes.  "We are weak in Him, but by God's power we will live with Him to serve Him.

 THIS HAS SOME OF THE STORIES THAT BELONG TO FUTURE HISTORY, BUT OVERALL A COLLECTION OF INTERESTING AND ODD STORIES.  AT ONE ONE POINT YOU WONDER IF ROD STERLING WILL POP OUT SOMEWHERE TO INTRODUCE TODAY'S EPISODE.  DEFINITELY WORTH READING 
 Peter White is my favorite jazz guitarist - hands down.  One on One is great, Hit the road is fun and Deja Vu is a delight.  A nice addition to my collection 
 This book is a must read for anybody who flys. It is a series of short two or three page stories by flyers before the age of jets. It is the kind of book a busy person can read to fill in those times when you are waiting to  do something else  since most stories are complete in just a few pages.  These a combat stories telling what damage fighter planes can do and what  dangers the pilots endure 
 This book is incredibly funny and silly.  Its about a little animal trying to save his valley.  It kept me on the edge of my seat 
 Anyone who's ready to share their expertise on the plateform in small and large settings will find a wealth of resources in this book.  If you're just getting started, Speak and Grow Rich will overwhelm you with revenue opportunities. What I suggest, as a veteran speaker, is that you have pad and paper by your side to list the numerous products you can realistically create to start your speaking career and boost sales.  Every product mentioned in the book won't be beneficial for you, but the ones that link you with your audience will create untold revenue.  I found myself skimming some of the chapters, and that's only because I've been speaking for more than 10 years, so I know and practice much of what the authors suggest. However, I poured over the details in chapters 3 and 9.  The information on learning to craft contracts so that you make money from recordings and don't give away this intellectual property is priceless whether you're just starting or a long-time speaker. This tutorial was eloquently explained and not to be overlooked.  Speak and Grow Rich will help you to trade in your stage fright for bountiful checks you can bank on 
 This is a great book for anyone who has always suspected that there is more to rock music than just 3 chords, tough-guy posturing, and stories of wild lifestyles.  As a working musician for over 20 years, I've seen first-hand how much skill goes into making even the simplest-sounding records.  I especially liked the chapters on Yes and the Beach Boys.  Let's have more of this kind of writing! 
 Harold Bloom's _Anxiety of Influence_ is a must read for any student of literary theory, just so you know where he stands in theories of modern poetry.  It is a seminal piece of work, full of allusions, offering a theory of poetics based on Freud's Oedipal complex.  It's major flaw is that it doesn't even attempt to account for female poets(although Bloom recognizes Emily Dickinson as one of the strong modern poets) 
 I have read nearly all of Michael Connelly's Bosch novels, and I would say that CITY OF BONES is one of the better ones in the series.   I don't think this novel rivals the best Bosch books like THE CONCRETE BLONDE and THE LAST COYOTE.  But this novel is better than novels like ANGEL FLIGHT and the subpar DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT.  This novel is essentially a "cold case" mystery involving the recently discovered bones of a young child who was murdered over twenty years ago.  Bosch tries to get to the bottom of the child's murder, and uncovers a lot of family secrets along the way.  I found the plot realistic and highly interesting and I thought Connelly did a good job with the story.  This is a real page-turner.  The most annoying aspect of this book is the romantic subplot, which seems forced and underdeveloped.  I also find it unconvincing that Bosch, a man in his fifties, would have a beautiful woman in her mid-thirties throwing herself at him.  I was also highly disappointed with how this relationship was resolved.  In my opinion, Connelly has never done a convincing job of creating a believable romantic relationship for Bosch.  Overall, though, CITY OF BONES is a great read and much better than other crime novels out there.  Highly recommended 
 I was introduced to Doreen Virtue's works about a month ago and am a new fan.  This is a powerful tape filled with amazing stories and suggestions about working blending life and spirit.  I recommend this piece to anyone improving the quality of their lives because this is just another stip towards fulfillment 
 This movie is the best! It is a story that combines all of what you have heard or know about Treasure Island. It's a special Long John Silver edition, with all the elements from the animation cartoon series, as well as the movies in animation as well as non-animation. It's a delightful family movie that is sure to please all ages. Get this one; you won't be disappointed 
 Many ikebana books shows a very traditional way of arranging  flower. This  book, however, shows a simpler and more modern way  arrangement with the  result of nice and unusual looks of flower arrangement. The step-by-step is  helpful and quite detailed. The book shows lots of different variations for  cool vases or containers as well 
 Kenny Wayne Shepherd came on the blues scence with his first debut album Ledbetter Heights proving us all he's the next best young blues guitarist. Ledbetter Heights is filled with blues on songs like Deja Voodoo, and Shame, Shame, Shame. Their is also some slide guitar on Aberdeen. He does Stevie Ray Vaughan's cover on here also titled Im Leaving You (Commit A Crime). Ledbetter Heights is better than Trouble Is...the guitar playing is better I personally think. Kenny Wayne also does a slow song live titled While We Cry its alot like Lenny or Little Wing still has power. Ledbetter Heights is one of the best blues albums for any guitarist Highly Recomened 
 Ill Communication is a good album, almost excellent if it wasn't for a lot of the second half, which often times confuses me.  Following the same formula as CHECK YOUR HEAD (fusing hip hop tracks, with punk-alternative tracks, with jazzy funk instrumentals) but doesn't really take off as well. Thats not to say this album is bad, actually up until SAMBROSA it is consistent, and then starts to break after that. Some tracks just are odd, but the fun is discovering your own gems in this peice. STILL WORTH THE TICKET. SABOTAGE is a NAAAAAAASTY SONG 
 I stumbled upon this book this week. It's a beautiful and poetic work that takes you to the timeframe of the four young women (my personal favorite is Minerva) and dumps you into their world of tragedy and trimpuh. Tying in fiction and fact makes the story all the more interesting. Julia Alvarez is a fantastic writer; just the right amount of words, just the right amount of atmosphere. Highly recommended. 
 I saw this band perform once and decided to take a chance and buy their album. It's amazing! The songs are fun. Under the Influence is awesome 
 This is one great movie! like all users had stated, the trouble with this new SE DVD is the moviee, Splitted by half across the 2 disc!  i hate the forced "intermission" switching between discs!!  i hope this practice of divide the film over 2 disc became erradicated!!  
 Robert Leckie is the best author I have ever seen detailing the wars in U.S. History.  This book is another great story detailing the Marines struggle against the Empire of Japan.  Because Mr. Leckie was a participant, this offering provides greater detail of the battles than most of his books.  He really gives good descriptions of the people and places where the battles were fought and the courage of the Marines and Japanese as they were locked in a life or death struggle.  This is an excellent book on the ground war in the Pacific 
 This is my favorite of all the Falco books.  I love the plot, especially the MO of the murderer, I love plebian Marcus' ongoing relationship with patrician Helena Justina, but most especially I love the storyline involving Titus, the turbot, Marcus' brother's shield, and the Praetorian Guard.  Read it and weep, because you'll be laughing hard enough to 
 I have not read this book, I was just looking through reviews. Anonymous seems not to understand the grammatical and mathematical terms first, second, third, etc. If s/he thinks that the fifth year means we are talking about a five-year-old, than what does s/he think about the first year? A one-year-old? Then how do you refer to a 0-12-month-old baby? The 0th year? Anonymous: the first year means from birth to 12 months, the second year means from 12-24 months (one-year-old), the third year means 24-36 months (two-year-old) and so on. Therefore the book phrased the age categories absolutely correctly. Thought you should know... Now I am interested in reading the book 
 Will Durant's "Our Oriental Heritage" is the first of eleven volumes, which make for his superb macro-history the Story of Civilization.  He begins with an analysis of the origins of civilization, and then moves on with a survey of Near Eastern civilizations (Sumeria, Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria, Judea, and Persia).  Durant focuses on all the Mesopotamian civilizations from their rise and fall, and deals with Egypt from the earliest kings to the death of Alexander.  Then he moves into the Far East, where he handles Indian, Chinese, and Japanese civilization to the contemporary world of Will Durant.  This excellent overview of Oriental culture will broaden any Occidental mans' perspective on just how his culture and civilization arose.  It will allow him to question many western ideals and values and compel him to further understand these remarkable civilizations to which we are so highly indebted.  Durant's work will, in a sense, place the eastern mind in the western man while reading through these pages, even if it is only for a moment.  This work sets the tone for the rest, so get to reading and enjoy the ride from here to the Age of Napoleon 
 Devil In A Blue Dress is a beautiful book, with its Southern dialect and the change of the pace of Los Angeles's tough streets. Devil In A Blue Dress tells the story of Ekeziel 'Easy' Rawlins and his quest to pay his mortrage after he is fired from his job at a defense plant. The books explores the racial and gender segregation in post war America. It invites you, the reader, into a web of desire and intrigue 
 Sea of Glory by Nathaniel Philbrick is the fascinating, true story of the US Navy's South Sea Exploring Expedition to the Pacific that began in 1838.  There were several goals to this ambitious trip: they were to go as far south on the globe as possible, survey the Polynesian Islands, survey the Columbia River and San Francisco Bay, and have scientists collect samples of new flora, fauna, etc.  While the Ex. Ex. started off as following in the footsteps of Captain Cook, the officer in charge of the expedition, Charles Wilkes, quickly morphed into Captain Bligh.    The Ex. Ex. accomplished quite a bit.  Wilkes "discovered" Antarctica and even gave the continent its name.  They charted many island groups including Fiji, Tahiti, Samoa, and Hawaii, as well as the Columbia River, Puget Sound and the San Francisco Bay.  The scientists on board (some of the best of that time period) made many unique discoveries and brought back 40 tons of specimens and artifacts.  Even the philologist on board did much to identify Indian language and preserve oral history.  And the crew saw countless wonders of nature including icebergs over 830 feet high, the Aurora Australis, active volcanoes and oceans that looked like they were churning fire.    Unfortunately, Lt. Charles Wilkes made the four years of the Ex. Ex. a living hell.  He was a jealous, petty, paranoid, insecure, arrogant, overbearing and vengeful egomaniac.  He wasn't the first choice for the Ex. Ex. (or the second or third). He did have good survey skills, but limited seamanship.  He was extremely jealous of anyone more knowledgeable or skilled than he.  His way of dealing with this was to trump up some bogus charge and then have the men sent back to the states (not an easy thing from Australia or Hawaii).  He loved the lash and insisted on punishing his crew in this manner, and always with more lashes than allowed by naval law.  When the US Navy refused to promote him to captain and commodore (he had a squadron of 6 ships), Wilkes promoted himself when the Ex. Ex. reached the Pacific and there was little chance of running into other American ships. When it was apparent that the expedition would take an additional year, many of the sailors signed off and left.  But Wilkes would not let the marines do the same.  He had them beaten on a daily basis until they realized that if they didn't acquiesce, they would eventually be beaten to death.  It wasn't long before he alienated all the officers and men of the expedition.  You'll have to read the book to see if Wilkes ever got his due.  Sea of Glory is filled with drawings, photos and maps, but it would have been more helpful to have the maps all in one location.  It was difficult to keep flipping back to find maps of specific island groups.  Also, while I grew up in a sailing family and have a basic knowledge of sailing terms, Philbrick gives us liberal doses of sailing vocabulary without explanation including hawse holes, capstans, taffrels, davits, cutwaters and stoppers--to name just a few.  Philbrick spends much time describing almost all of their experiences while at sea, but there is virtually nothing about California and the surveying of the San Francisco Bay.  So while I thoroughly enjoyed Sea of Glory, I felt these deficiencies kept me from giving it five stars.   
 Desperation is my favourite "stand alone" King novel to date. King's "Dark Tower" books are my favourite King books but Desperation is up there high on the list! It's a superior work to it's sister book "The Regulators" (which I personally enjoyed) written under the name of Richard Bachman and the writing and storytelling skills that king has pleanty of are on full display. It's a big novel, worth your time and very enjoyable 
 This book is a superlative collection of stories involving a variety of animals, narrated in extraodinary dialogue of humor, insight and sometimes nostalgia!  If you like pets, this book is a must!  If you enjoy quality writing and pleasurable reading, this book is imperative!  Attractive photos enhance this wonderful volume of fascinating, awesome chapters in the lives of a myriad of species 
 I'm not in a position to go trekking around visiting colleges with my teens. Although we live near one very large university, my teens see students superficially --  as local consumers and frat dwellers -- and have never identified as "college students". This book helped expand their idea of what higher education might be. The book is very encouraging for willing, curious students whose achievements don't map on the A-F axis 
 Great cd very romantic and easy listenin 
 I am an avid but sceptical reader of relationship / couple books but it's hard to find anything to criticise in this one.  I purchased this book when I decided I needed to clarify exactly what I wanted and needed in a relationship and it has literally become my relationship "bible".  If you want a very clear, simple and complete map for the route to a healthy relationship with both yourself (most important!) and a partner then click purchase now.  It could just be the book that should be mandatorily handed to all people considering starting a relationship.  
 Why anyone would judge a book by its cover--literally--and be so obnoxious about it is beyond me. Obviously, the 'reviewer' did not read the book and has her own issues with body image and appearance. If she had read the book she would know that it is NOT whiny and NOT written by someone in need of therapy. It is sensitive and funny and heartbreaking and introspective and relevant and important and in-depth and caring and just terrific. Amazon should remove the so-called 'review' below from this page--it is hurtful to the kids on the cover and conveys NOTHING about the book. It says more about the 'reviewer' than anything else; she's the one with problems. 
 Up to this point, this is probably Floyd's best greatest hits compilation, and it does contain some pretty good tracks, but I think it leaves off too many crucial tracks to be considered the best Pink Floyd greatest hits compilation.  Most of the important tracks from the Syd Barrett era are all pretty much included, though I'd have liked to see tracks like Lucifer Sam and Interstellar Overdrive included as well.  One important track that should have been included is Roger Waters' first composition for the band, Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk.  Seeing as he'd go on to the writer for the band throughout it's prime, I think it would have been a neat glimpse into his first material for the band.  Moving on, I also think that "Free Four," Floyd's first song to receive significant airplay in the US should have been included.  While it may not be a huge track today, it did bring them to the spotlight in the US, and is just as crucial as any other.  Some other complaints of mine stem from the tracks they included from DSOTM.  Time and Money are both included, but where's Brain Damage / Eclipse?  One of the first Floyd songs I remember hearing from a young age, and possibly the one that got me into them is not included, but tracks like Great Gig in the Sky and Us and Them, while great tracks, aren't quite as important to a compilation like this, when Brain Damage / Eclipse should have been included instead.  From Animals, we have "Sheep," which is my personal least favorite on the album, and not a track I ever remember hearing before I got into Floyd.  Why not "Dogs," or "Pigs (Three Different Ones)" instead? Much better tracks.  And where's "Young Lust" and "Run Like Hell" from the Wall?  What about "Not Now John" from The Final Cut?  Like I said, while a fairly good compilation, I think it misses a lot of crucial tracks to Floyd's history.  Sure, it's still Floyd, and all Floyd is going to be awesome anyway, but if you're going to make it reflect over Floyd's 40 year history, then better make sure all you have all their best 
 When I received this book I was blown away by how much useful information it contained. It was easy to read and understand, has quick references that pertain to your subject or you can skip to something more applicable, and was filled with up-to-date information on how to obtain a patent. A great resource 
 This razor's best virtue for me is its ability to cut a thick beard without clogging like the multi blade cartridges out there. I always dreaded shaving after a hunting or fishing trip. Even the old Gillette twist-open requires that it be partially opened to properly rinse out the cream and whisker sludge. This guy has a nice round cavity underneath each cutting edge that allows water to wash everything away. Even shaking it in a bowl will clear it most of the time. If it should clog, one can blow it out quite easily. I have only used the lower settings, and they are all I seem to need with good blades. The Gillette blades sold in the US are horrible, BTW. Use Merkur blades or Swedish Gillettes for the best shave.  My only complaint is that the alignment marks to match up the top and body are faint, and the adjustment marks do not line up properly, and I am forced to do math to get repeatability. I have higher expectations for German engineering and the price.  This thing is overpriced for what it is, but a good shave is worth a lot, and you only buy it once 
 I had one similar to this when I was younger - i am now 21 - and I still totally remember this toy!!! The one my brother and I had was acutally for 4 people though - not for 2.  I was so excited to see this... I know that many people thought I was crazy when I would talk about my favorite child toy.... This is it, many people did not believe there was such a thing.  This is also a great toy because it is good fo a child's vestibular system (I have an AA in ECE)so I will be buying one for my son asap - he's still a little too young - but as soon as he is 2 1/2, he will have this toy!!!
